00:00:20,64 --> 00:00:22,43
‎科学家在尝试各种方案
Scientists are trying everything,

5
00:00:22,52 --> 00:00:25,10
‎从现有药物到新疗法
from existing medicines to new therapies.

6
00:00:25,19 --> 00:00:27,77
‎但最有可能终结这场全球大流行病的
But the most likely way we'll end this pandemic

7
00:00:28,31 --> 00:00:29,40
‎还是疫苗
is a vaccine.

9
00:00:31,19 --> 00:00:33,11
‎2020年3月16日
On March 16th, 2020,

10
00:00:33,19 --> 00:00:34,99
‎第一种疫苗投入测试
the first one was tested.

11
00:00:35,07 --> 00:00:36,20
‎我是珍妮佛哈勒
I'm Jennifer Haller,

12
00:00:36,28 --> 00:00:40,87
‎我是第一个 ‎接种试验用新冠肺炎疫苗的人
and I was the first person to receive an experimental COVID-19 vaccine.

13
00:00:41,62 --> 00:00:44,54
‎我们之前开发试验用疫苗的速度 ‎相当快
[narrator] We've made other test vaccines pretty quickly.

14
00:00:44,62 --> 00:00:46,75
‎非典疫苗用了20个月
One for SARS took 20 months,

15
00:00:46,83 --> 00:00:49,04
‎埃博拉疫苗用了七个月
one for Ebola, seven months,

16
00:00:49,13 --> 00:00:51,96
‎寨卡疫苗 大约六个月
and one for Zika, around six months.

17
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:54,97
‎但这一次破了记录
But this vaccine candidate crushed those records.

18
00:00:55,05 --> 00:00:57,55
‎只用65天就做出来了
It was made in just 65 days.

19
00:00:58,18 --> 00:01:00,60
‎但是 要想终结这场全球大流行病
If it's going to end this pandemic, though,

20
00:01:00,68 --> 00:01:02,89
‎还有很长的路要走
it's got a long way still to go.

21
00:01:04,14 --> 00:01:07,56
‎每一种潜在有效疫苗 ‎都要走过一条艰难的道路
See, any potential vaccine has a difficult path ahead,

22
00:01:07,65 --> 00:01:11,19
‎这条路漫长曲折 充满挑战和考验
a long and twisting course full of challenges and trials.

23
00:01:11,52 --> 00:01:12,57
‎在美国
In the US,

24
00:01:12,65 --> 00:01:15,86
‎一种疫苗从开始到最终完成
typically it takes a vaccine candidate a decade or so

25
00:01:15,95 --> 00:01:17,74
‎通常需要十年
to make it from start to finish,

26
00:01:18,24 --> 00:01:21,37
‎90%的疫苗跑不到终点
and around 90% fail to complete it.

27
00:01:22,41 --> 00:01:24,33
‎我们没有那么多时间
We don't have that kind of time.

28
00:01:24,87 --> 00:01:26,75
‎每天都有人死亡
Every day, people are dying,

29
00:01:27,67 --> 00:01:29,88
‎经济损失越来越大

30
00:01:30,92 --> 00:01:35,26
‎专家希望 ‎2021年就能有疫苗普遍推广
Experts are hoping a vaccine can be widely available in 2021.

31
00:01:35,76 --> 00:01:37,01
‎要实现这个目标
To pull that off,

32
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:40,89
‎就必须用破纪录的速度 ‎走完研发过程的每一个阶段
it will have to get through every stretch of this course in record time.

33
00:01:41,51 --> 00:01:44,68
‎这是对人与机器的终极考验
[car engines roaring]

33
00:01:42,14 --> 00:01:44,85
[announcer] This is the supreme test of man and machine.

34
00:01:44,93 --> 00:01:47,31
‎很多人从发车线出发
But while many are called to the starting line,

35
00:01:47,39 --> 00:01:50,23
‎但只有不到一半能跑完艰苦的全程
usually less than half finish the grueling drive.

36
00:01:51,90 --> 00:01:55,99
‎幸运的是 已有超过100种备选疫苗 ‎在研发过程中
[narrator] Fortunately, more than 100 vaccine candidates are giving it a shot,

37
00:01:56,32 --> 00:02:00,70
‎全世界的科学家参与了疫苗的开发 ‎有资深大学教授…
made by scientists all over the world, from veterans at universities...

00:02:00,78 --> 00:02:03,70
‎我们有很多杰出的科学家
We have a dedicated group of extraordinary scientists

39
00:02:03,79 --> 00:02:06,16
‎夜以继日地不懈工作
that are in the lab day and night.

40
00:02:06,25 --> 00:02:07,96
‎也有大型制药企业
[narrator] ...to pharmaceutical giants...

41
00:02:08,04 --> 00:02:11,00
‎我们有研发团队 人人精神百倍
We have the teams to do this, and everyone is excited.

42
00:02:11,08 --> 00:02:12,67
‎采用已经证明的技术…
[narrator] ...using proven techniques...

43
00:02:12,75 --> 00:02:17,17
‎当然 针对冠状病毒疫苗 ‎我们有一定先发优势
And, of course, with the coronavirus vaccine,

44
00:02:15,30 --> 00:02:17,22
we have a particular head start.

44
00:02:17,47 --> 00:02:20,22
‎…和从来没有试验过的新方法
[narrator] ...and approaches that have never been tested before.

45
00:02:20,30 --> 00:02:21,85
‎大家都在相互竞争
Everybody competes with each other,

46
00:02:21,93 --> 00:02:24,76
‎但最终 只有最优秀的留下来
but eventually, only the very best survive.

47
00:02:24,85 --> 00:02:29,27
‎但是 开发一款疫苗 ‎也要耗费大量金钱…
[narrator] But getting a vaccine is also going to take a lot of money...

48
00:02:29,35 --> 00:02:32,56
‎好的 这里有我们 ‎我们可以让资金快速到位
Okay, here we are. You know, we can get money out really fast.

49
00:02:32,65 --> 00:02:34,48
‎我们可以进行评估
We can do evaluations of these things.

50
00:02:34,57 --> 00:02:38,78
‎现在 我们都在加快速度 ‎在全世界寻找最佳方案
Now we're all trying to step up

52
00:02:36,53 --> 00:02:38,90
and look all over the world for the best ideas.

51
00:02:39,24 --> 00:02:40,61
‎…需要协作
[narrator] ...and collaboration.

52
00:02:40,70 --> 00:02:43,24
‎全球科学界同仁
The entire global scientific community

53
00:02:43,32 --> 00:02:46,66
‎以史无前例的方式走到一起
has come together in a truly unprecedented way.

54
00:02:46,74 --> 00:02:48,79
‎也离不开勇敢的志愿者
[narrator] ...and brave volunteers.

55
00:02:49,04 --> 00:02:52,54
‎我们都感到无助 ‎我觉得 这件事我可以做
We're all feeling so helpless, and this was something that I saw

56
00:02:52,63 --> 00:02:56,55
‎而且很可能会对大家有帮助
that I could do that could potentially make a difference.

57
00:02:56,96 --> 00:03:01,59
‎就这样 他们共同投入了一场 ‎史上最成败攸关的科学竞赛
[narrator] Together, they're in one of the most

60
00:02:59,26 --> 00:03:01,63
high-stakes scientific races in history.

58
00:03:02,14 --> 00:03:04,68
‎我把它比作太空竞赛
I compare this to a space race.

59
00:03:04,97 --> 00:03:09,98
‎众多竞争者 争夺一个未知的目标 ‎“我怎么去火星？”
We have so many contenders reaching for something that was previously unknown.

63
00:03:08,73 --> 00:03:09,98
"How do I get to Mars?"

60
00:03:10,06 --> 00:03:11,10
‎“我怎么去金星？”
"How do I get to Venus?"

61
00:03:11,19 --> 00:03:13,94
‎“我们怎么制造 ‎下一代新冠肺炎疫苗？”
"How do we create the next COVID-19 vaccine?"

62
00:03:14,40 --> 00:03:16,07
‎还有一个重要的问题：
[narrator] And the other big question:

63
00:03:16,15 --> 00:03:18,15
‎我们能在多短的时间里实现？
how fast can we do it?

68
00:03:18,61 --> 00:03:19,69
[theme music playing]

64
00:03:19,78 --> 00:03:23,28
‎现在 我们已经有了病毒
Given the fact that we now have the virus in our hands,

65
00:03:23,36 --> 00:03:25,20
‎我们会开发出疫苗
we will develop a vaccine.

66
00:03:25,66 --> 00:03:30,87
‎我们可以以前所未有的速度行动
[man 1] We can move very fast in ways that have not been previously achieved.

67
00:03:30,96 --> 00:03:34,71
‎一旦疫苗被证明是安全的
[man 2] It's only once that vaccine has been proven to be safe

68
00:03:34,79 --> 00:03:37,46
‎就立刻投入使用
that it'll be allowed out of confinement.

69
00:03:37,84 --> 00:03:39,55
‎他们需要疫苗
[man 3] What they needed was a vaccine,

70
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:42,47
‎一天没有找到 ‎他们的奋斗就一天不停止
and the fight never stopped till it was found.

71
00:03:44,84 --> 00:03:48,60
‎还有其他病毒需要分离 ‎其他疫苗有待开发
[man 4] There remain other viruses to be isolated, other vaccines to come,

72
00:03:48,68 --> 00:03:49,52
‎他们会成功的
but they will.

74
00:03:58,02 --> 00:04:01,90
‎这种冠状病毒 以及所有病毒 ‎都很难对付
[narrator] This coronavirus, and all viruses, are so hard to fight,

75
00:04:01,99 --> 00:04:04,99
‎原因之一是它们太简单了
in part because they're so simple.

76
00:04:05,62 --> 00:04:08,08
‎它们基本就是一个微小的信息载体
They're basically just little vehicles

77
00:04:08,16 --> 00:04:11,41
‎承载着指导它们进行自我复制的说明
that carry instructions on how to make more of themselves.

78
00:04:11,96 --> 00:04:16,38
‎为了繁衍 它们把这套复制说明 ‎偷偷运进我们的细胞
To reproduce, they smuggle these instructions into our cells

79
00:04:16,75 --> 00:04:20,46
‎强迫我们的细胞工厂制造更多病毒
and force our cellular machinery to make more and more viruses.

80
00:04:20,55 --> 00:04:23,80
‎它们在体内扩散 劫持更多细胞
They spread through the body and hijack more cells,

81
00:04:24,05 --> 00:04:25,84
‎在这个过程中 细胞被破坏
damaging them in the process,

82
00:04:26,34 --> 00:04:28,10
‎我们就生病了
which makes us feel sick.

83
00:04:29,18 --> 00:04:31,10
‎但我们不是没有防御措施
But we're not defenseless.

88
00:04:31,72 --> 00:04:32,56
[alarm blares]

84
00:04:32,64 --> 00:04:37,73
‎我们免疫系统的细胞会找到入侵者 ‎识别出一种标记
-[narrator] Cells in our immune system -[siren wails]

90
00:04:34,73 --> 00:04:37,73
can find the intruder and identify a marker,

85
00:04:37,81 --> 00:04:41,07
‎一种特征鲜明的标记 我们叫它抗原
a distinguishing feature which we call an antigen.

86
00:04:41,36 --> 00:04:46,49
‎然后 它们就行动起来 找到并消灭 ‎任何携带这种抗原的物质
Then they mobilize to seek out and destroy anything with that antigen.

87
00:04:47,03 --> 00:04:51,20
‎我们的免疫系统还会产生一种 ‎叫做抗体的小分子
Our immune system also produces little molecules called antibodies

88
00:04:51,29 --> 00:04:55,04
‎抗体附着于抗原 标记并制服病毒
that stick to that antigen, tagging and subduing the virus.

89
00:04:55,42 --> 00:04:56,92
‎但是 从我们被感染那一天开始
But from the day we're infected,

90
00:04:57,00 --> 00:05:00,75
‎可能需要两周时间 ‎免疫反应才会全面启动
it can take almost two weeks for this response to ramp up,

91
00:05:01,88 --> 00:05:05,17
‎足以让冠状病毒扩散到全身
enough time for this coronavirus to swarm through the body,

92
00:05:05,80 --> 00:05:07,01
‎造成伤害
wreaking havoc.

93
00:05:08,47 --> 00:05:11,47
‎有时候 ‎我们的免疫系统还会反应过度
And sometimes our immune system ramps up too much

94
00:05:11,56 --> 00:05:13,52
‎导致更多伤害
and causes even more harm.

95
00:05:13,89 --> 00:05:17,77
‎有些人伤害太严重
In some people, all this damage becomes overwhelming,

96
00:05:18,31 --> 00:05:19,40
‎导致死亡
and they die.

97
00:05:19,73 --> 00:05:22,28
‎我值一天班 就宣布了六名患者死亡
In one shift, I pronounced six people dead.

98
00:05:23,11 --> 00:05:25,28
‎如果有办法医治 就好了
[narrator] This is where having a treatment would help.

99
00:05:26,36 --> 00:05:30,58
‎有的疗法是注射抗体 ‎也就是那些降服病毒的小分子
Some inject antibodies, those molecules that subdue the virus,

100
00:05:30,66 --> 00:05:33,45
‎或者是在实验室合成的抗体
either synthetic antibodies made in a lab,

101
00:05:33,54 --> 00:05:35,66
‎或是从康复患者血液中分离出的抗体
or from the blood of people who've recovered.

102
00:05:36,50 --> 00:05:40,04
‎有的疗法是对失控的免疫系统 ‎加以控制
Others rein in our immune systems if they're getting out of control.

103
00:05:40,63 --> 00:05:42,88
‎还有的疗法 比如瑞德西韦
And some, like Remdesivir,

104
00:05:42,96 --> 00:05:47,01
‎是进入细胞 阻止病毒自我复制
actually enter our cells to block the virus from copying itself.

105
00:05:47,09 --> 00:05:50,97
‎早期结果显示 ‎它可能可以降低病毒的致命性
Early results showed it could potentially make the virus less deadly.

106
00:05:51,55 --> 00:05:54,43
‎这是一个很重要的概念验证
It is a very important proof of concept,

107
00:05:54,52 --> 00:05:59,69
‎这证明了 一种药物可以阻断病毒
because what it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.

108
00:06:00,52 --> 00:06:05,19
‎但截至五月 还没有一种疗法 ‎能防止人患病
[narrator] But as of May,

115
00:06:01,98 --> 00:06:05,19
none of these treatments can stop a person from getting sick,

109
00:06:05,28 --> 00:06:07,65
‎或阻止病毒人际传播
or spreading this coronavirus to others.

110
00:06:08,20 --> 00:06:09,91
‎疫苗可以做到
A vaccine would,

111
00:06:10,53 --> 00:06:12,66
‎因为疫苗利用了人体
and it does it by taking advantage of something

112
00:06:12,74 --> 00:06:15,83
‎经过数百万年进化而来的一种能力
our bodies have evolved over millions of years:

113
00:06:15,91 --> 00:06:16,75
‎记忆
memory.

114
00:06:17,62 --> 00:06:21,79
‎我们的免疫系统对抗过一种病毒之后 ‎就记住了它的抗原
After it deals with a virus, our immune system remembers the antigens,

115
00:06:22,09 --> 00:06:23,46
‎有时是终生记忆
sometimes forever,

116
00:06:23,92 --> 00:06:26,05
‎有时只能记住一段时间
other times just for a while.

117
00:06:26,84 --> 00:06:30,76
‎我们知道 我们的身体 ‎对其他冠状病毒的记忆长达好几年
We know our bodies can remember these other coronaviruses for a couple years.

118
00:06:31,14 --> 00:06:33,22
‎如果这种冠状病毒的情况类似
So if this coronavirus is similar

119
00:06:33,81 --> 00:06:36,56
‎并且它在几年内再次入侵我们的身体
and it shows up in our bodies again in that time,

120
00:06:36,64 --> 00:06:40,60
‎我们的免疫系统就能更快地作出反应 ‎重拳出击
our immune system can ramp up much faster with overwhelming force,

121
00:06:40,69 --> 00:06:43,31
‎消灭病毒 使我们不至于生病
wiping out the virus before it can make us sick

122
00:06:43,40 --> 00:06:44,77
‎也不至于传染给他人
or spread to someone else.

123
00:06:45,23 --> 00:06:48,74
‎所谓对某病毒免疫 就是这个意思
This is what it means to be immune to a virus.

124
00:06:49,15 --> 00:06:50,95
‎疫苗能让我们免疫
A vaccine makes us immune

125
00:06:51,03 --> 00:06:54,49
‎方法就是安全地告诉我们的身体 ‎某种病毒长什么样
by safely showing the body what a virus looks like,

126
00:06:54,58 --> 00:06:59,00
‎制造一次假的感染 ‎教会身体如何反应
faking this first infection to teach your body how to respond,

127
00:06:59,08 --> 00:07:02,50
‎这样 如果身体遇到真的病毒 ‎就知道该怎么办了
so when it does encounter the real virus, it's ready.

128
00:07:03,13 --> 00:07:05,46
‎没有100%有效的病毒
No vaccine is 100% effective,

129
00:07:05,55 --> 00:07:09,22
‎不是每个人接种疫苗之后 ‎都能彻底免疫
meaning not everyone who receives one will be perfectly immune,

130
00:07:09,30 --> 00:07:12,84
‎但疫苗不需要百试百效 ‎也能终止疫病流行
but vaccines don't need to be perfect to end epidemics.

131
00:07:13,30 --> 00:07:16,06
‎天花曾经是一种高致命性疾病
Smallpox used to be a leading cause of death,

132
00:07:16,14 --> 00:07:19,89
‎麻疹曾经每年杀死数百万人 ‎多数是儿童
and measles killed millions a year, most of them children.

133
00:07:19,98 --> 00:07:23,77
‎但是 多亏有了有效率达到95%的疫苗
But thanks to vaccines that are around 95% effective,

134
00:07:24,02 --> 00:07:25,73
‎我们现在已经消灭了天花
we've wiped out smallpox

135
00:07:25,82 --> 00:07:28,94
‎对抗麻疹也取得了长足进步
and made enormous progress against measles.

136
00:07:29,40 --> 00:07:32,61
‎疫苗制造者希望能造出 ‎这么有效的疫苗
Vaccine makers are hoping to make a vaccine that effective.

137
00:07:32,70 --> 00:07:38,29
‎如果我们只能造出 比如说 ‎有效率为50%的疫苗
If all we could make was a vaccine that, let's say, had 50% efficacy,

138
00:07:38,37 --> 00:07:40,83
‎那么它能防止半数的感染
so it prevented about half of the infections,

139
00:07:40,91 --> 00:07:45,38
‎如果这意味着死亡人数减半 ‎那也是真正的好消息
if that translates into stopping half of the deaths,

147
00:07:44,04 --> 00:07:45,38
that's really good news.

140
00:07:45,84 --> 00:07:50,51
‎事实上 疫苗是人类历史上 ‎最重要的发明之一
[narrator] The fact is,

149
00:07:46,67 --> 00:07:50,51
vaccines are one of the most significant inventions in human history.

141
00:07:50,97 --> 00:07:52,72
‎这个世界上没有太多共识
The world doesn't agree on much,

142
00:07:52,80 --> 00:07:57,39
‎但是 超过90%的人 ‎相信儿童接种疫苗很重要
but more than 90% of all people believe childhood vaccinations are important,

143
00:07:57,47 --> 00:08:01,10
‎这至关重要 因为 要消灭一种传染病
and that's crucial, because to wipe out an infectious disease,

144
00:08:01,18 --> 00:08:04,06
‎你需要全世界多数人口都免疫
you need most people in the world to be immune.

145
00:08:04,65 --> 00:08:06,44
‎这叫群体免疫
It's called herd immunity.

146
00:08:06,52 --> 00:08:11,82
‎一个人感染后存活 或者接种疫苗
The idea is that individuals become immune either by getting infected and surviving,

147
00:08:11,90 --> 00:08:13,40
‎都可实现免疫
or by getting vaccinated.

148
00:08:13,91 --> 00:08:15,82
‎当足够的人实现了免疫
When enough people are immune,

149
00:08:15,91 --> 00:08:18,87
‎病毒就难以传播 速度放慢
the virus has trouble spreading, and slows down.

150
00:08:19,37 --> 00:08:21,54
‎你知道 通过接种疫苗 ‎你不只是保护你自己
You know, you are also protecting by vaccinating yourself

151
00:08:21,62 --> 00:08:25,50
‎也是在保护周围的易感人群
not just yourself, but you are protecting weak members in the community

152
00:08:25,58 --> 00:08:27,54
‎那些可能无法获得疫苗的人
who may not be able to get the vaccine.

153
00:08:28,09 --> 00:08:32,13
‎比如新生儿 老年人 ‎和免疫系统较弱的群体
[narrator] Like newborns, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems.

154
00:08:32,22 --> 00:08:36,80
‎所以这既是自我保护 ‎也是一种利他行为
So it's both an act of protecting yourself and it's also an act of altruism.

155
00:08:37,22 --> 00:08:41,93
‎所以 打败一种传染病 ‎需要全世界通力合作
[narrator] So defeating an infectious disease

165
00:08:39,56 --> 00:08:41,93
requires the whole world coming together,

156
00:08:42,02 --> 00:08:46,06
‎在对抗新冠肺炎的竞赛中 ‎全世界的团结合作史无前例
and in the COVID-19 race, the world has come together like never before.

157
00:08:47,44 --> 00:08:50,11
‎截至五月 有100多种疫苗正在研制中
Out of the over 100 candidates in the race in May,

158
00:08:50,19 --> 00:08:54,65
‎一半以上在北美 17种在中国
almost half are in North America, and 17 are in China.

159
00:08:54,74 --> 00:08:56,78
‎大家的经费来源也各不相同
And they're funded in different ways,

160
00:08:56,86 --> 00:08:58,57
‎多数是由私人企业支持
most by private industry.

161
00:08:59,70 --> 00:09:03,33
‎但最主要的区别还是他们的疫苗平台
But the main difference between them is their vaccine platform,

162
00:09:03,41 --> 00:09:06,17
‎如何告诉人体病毒长什么样
how they're showing the body what the virus looks like.

163
00:09:07,33 --> 00:09:11,25
‎有的疫苗把弱化了的病毒注射入人体
Some vaccines inject a weakened version of the virus into the body.

164
00:09:11,34 --> 00:09:15,55
‎它已不能复制或造成伤害 ‎但仍然携带有抗原
It can't reproduce or do damage but it still has that antigen,

165
00:09:15,63 --> 00:09:18,93
‎这样 我们的免疫系统就可以 ‎学会如何识别目标
so our immune system can learn what to watch out for.

166
00:09:19,30 --> 00:09:21,64
‎我们针对脊髓灰质炎、麻疹
That's how we vaccinate against polio,

167
00:09:21,72 --> 00:09:23,68
‎流行性腮腺炎和风疹
the measles, mumps, and rubella,

168
00:09:23,77 --> 00:09:25,56
‎水痘、轮状病毒还有流感的疫苗
chicken pox, rotavirus,

169
00:09:25,64 --> 00:09:27,14
‎就是这样
and for the flu.

170
00:09:27,60 --> 00:09:30,73
‎这是至今为止最成熟有效的方法
This is by far our most tried-and-true method,

171
00:09:30,82 --> 00:09:32,90
‎但是这种方法很慢
but it's a slow way to do it.

172
00:09:32,98 --> 00:09:37,11
‎我们要在其他活体细胞 比如鸡蛋中 ‎培养病毒几个月
We have to grow the virus for months in other living cells, like chicken eggs,

173
00:09:37,20 --> 00:09:39,37
‎这种方法我们已经用了几十年
a method we've been using for decades.

174
00:09:39,78 --> 00:09:42,70
‎我们就叫它第一代疫苗吧
We'll call these the first-generation vaccines,

175
00:09:42,79 --> 00:09:45,66
‎截至五月初 ‎有九种第一代疫苗参与试验
and there are nine in the race as of early May.

176
00:09:46,71 --> 00:09:49,04
‎其他科学家在尝试一种新方法
Other scientists are trying a newer approach.

177
00:09:49,13 --> 00:09:51,04
‎他们不注射完整的冠状病毒
Instead of the whole coronavirus,

178
00:09:51,13 --> 00:09:53,50
‎而是只注射抗原
they're giving the body just an antigen,

179
00:09:53,59 --> 00:09:56,38
‎他们认为 这就足以激活免疫反应
a piece they think will activate the immune response.

180
00:09:56,63 --> 00:10:00,72
‎这些抗原也需要培养 ‎有时是在酵母细胞中培养
Those antigens also need to be grown, sometimes in yeast cells,

181
00:10:00,80 --> 00:10:02,85
‎或者是附着于另一个无害的病毒
or attached to another harmless virus.

182
00:10:03,39 --> 00:10:06,39
‎乙肝疫苗就是这个原理
This is how the vaccine for hepatitis B works,

183
00:10:06,48 --> 00:10:09,19
‎百日咳和脑膜炎也是这样
and for whooping cough, and meningitis B.

184
00:10:09,90 --> 00:10:12,94
‎我们叫这种疫苗第二代疫苗
We'll call these second-generation vaccines,

185
00:10:13,02 --> 00:10:17,99
‎在攻克新冠肺炎的竞赛中 ‎第二代疫苗应用最广 现有72个备选
and they're the most popular kind in the COVID-19 race, with 72 candidates.

186
00:10:19,11 --> 00:10:21,41
‎最后 还有一种全新的疫苗
Finally, there's a brand new type of vaccine

187
00:10:21,49 --> 00:10:24,41
‎它完全不使用病毒的任何成分
that doesn't use any part of the actual virus at all.

188
00:10:24,91 --> 00:10:28,46
‎而只是把病毒的复制信息 ‎传递给我们的身体
Instead, it just gives our bodies the virus's instructions,

189
00:10:28,54 --> 00:10:32,92
‎这些遗传信息片段 ‎能指导我们的细胞生产出抗原
tiny pieces of genetic code that tell our cells to produce the antigens,

190
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:35,09
‎从而激活免疫反应
which then activate the immune response.

191
00:10:35,63 --> 00:10:40,18
‎这种原理的疫苗 ‎还没有被批准应用于人体
No vaccine using this approach has ever been approved for use in humans.

192
00:10:40,26 --> 00:10:43,22
‎我们可以把这种疫苗称为第三代疫苗
We'll call these the third-generation vaccines,

193
00:10:43,30 --> 00:10:46,06
‎现有27种参与试验
and there are 27 in the race.

194
00:10:46,14 --> 00:10:49,19
‎第三代疫苗不需要培养病毒
Because they don't involve growing any part of any virus,

195
00:10:49,27 --> 00:10:51,48
‎所以制造速度可以非常快
they can be made extremely fast.

196
00:10:52,15 --> 00:10:55,98
‎这支破纪录的疫苗 ‎就是第三代备选疫苗
This record-breaking vaccine was a third-generation candidate

197
00:10:56,07 --> 00:10:58,07
‎来自美国莫德纳公司
from a US company called Moderna.

198
00:10:58,78 --> 00:11:01,45
‎但制造一种备选疫苗并不难
But making a vaccine candidate isn't the hard part.

199
00:11:01,86 --> 00:11:03,45
‎难的是下一步
This next phase is.

200
00:11:03,87 --> 00:11:04,99
‎临床试验
Clinical trials.

211
00:11:05,08 --> 00:11:06,20
[engines rev]

201
00:11:06,29 --> 00:11:07,95
‎他们全速前进
[announcer] And they're up to speed.

202
00:11:09,41 --> 00:11:11,75
‎传统上 临床试验分三个阶段
[narrator] Traditionally, there are three phases.

203
00:11:12,96 --> 00:11:16,30
‎首先 科研团队给少数人注射疫苗
First, teams give their vaccines to a small group of people,

204
00:11:16,38 --> 00:11:20,01
‎等几个月 ‎看看他们有没有危险的不良反应
wait a few months, and see if any of them report dangerous side effects.

205
00:11:20,84 --> 00:11:22,09
‎如果一切都好
If everything looks good,

206
00:11:22,18 --> 00:11:24,89
‎疫苗就进入下一阶段 ‎给大约200人接种
the vaccine moves on and is given to a couple hundred people,

207
00:11:24,97 --> 00:11:27,52
‎还是观察有无危险的不良反应
again, to see if there are any dangerous side effects,

208
00:11:27,60 --> 00:11:30,81
‎但也要观察人的免疫系统 ‎是否被调动起来
but also to see if people's immune systems ramp up.

209
00:11:30,89 --> 00:11:33,69
‎这需要等更久 通常几个月
That involves more waiting, usually months.

210
00:11:34,61 --> 00:11:37,27
‎然后 疫苗进入三期试验
Then the candidate moves on to the third test,

211
00:11:37,36 --> 00:11:40,53
‎数千人接种 ‎第三次确保没有不良反应
where thousands are vaccinated to triple-check for side effects

212
00:11:40,61 --> 00:11:42,24
‎同时观察效果
and see how well it works.

213
00:11:42,32 --> 00:11:45,28
‎这又要等几个月 甚至几年
That's another few months or years of waiting.

214
00:11:46,41 --> 00:11:47,99
‎这不同于药物试验
This isn't like testing a drug

215
00:11:48,08 --> 00:11:49,87
‎你让患者服药
where you give it to people with a disease

216
00:11:50,62 --> 00:11:52,16
‎看他们是否好转
and see if it makes them better.

217
00:11:52,83 --> 00:11:55,54
‎你是要把疫苗给没病的人
You're giving it to people who don't have a disease,

218
00:11:56,13 --> 00:12:00,01
‎然后观察他们是否仍然不得病
and then checking later to see if they still don't have the disease.

219
00:12:00,97 --> 00:12:04,68
‎正常情况下 整个过程会历时四年
In normal times, this whole process can take around four years,

220
00:12:04,76 --> 00:12:06,60
‎针对五千人进行试验
testing around 5,000 people.

221
00:12:07,14 --> 00:12:11,02
‎但是 疫苗开发者希望 ‎有些试验可以同步进行
But vaccine developers are hoping to do some of this testing simultaneously,

222
00:12:11,52 --> 00:12:15,69
‎还是测这么多人 ‎但都在18个月里完成
still testing the same number of people, but all in around 18 months.

223
00:12:16,23 --> 00:12:18,98
‎这就是为什么 ‎有的备选疫苗进展如此迅速
It's how some candidates are moving so quickly.

224
00:12:19,07 --> 00:12:22,78
‎药监局已经批准莫德纳疫苗 ‎进入二期临床试验
The FDA has cleared the Moderna vaccine for phase two of its trial.

225
00:12:22,86 --> 00:12:24,53
‎莫德纳以破纪录的速度前进
[reporter 1] Moderna moving at record speed.

226
00:12:24,61 --> 00:12:26,95
‎中国已经批准了另一项临床试验
China's already given approval for another clinical trial.

227
00:12:27,03 --> 00:12:28,20
‎现在已进入二期阶段
It's now at the second phase.

228
00:12:28,28 --> 00:12:31,37
‎目前 最有希望的疫苗
The vaccine, uh, that is most promising right now

229
00:12:31,45 --> 00:12:33,71
‎来自牛津大学
is the one from Oxford University.

230
00:12:33,79 --> 00:12:37,29
‎-一二期合并 ‎-神速
-That has merged phase one and phase two. -...which is speedy.

231
00:12:38,54 --> 00:12:42,09
‎这个阶段的竞赛不能更快了 ‎这是有原因的
[narrator] This stage of the race can't go any faster, for good reason.

232
00:12:42,51 --> 00:12:44,76
‎不进行所有这些试验
[Kirchhelle] Without running through all of these trials,

233
00:12:44,84 --> 00:12:46,55
‎就推出疫苗
it would be absolutely unethical

234
00:12:46,93 --> 00:12:50,39
‎让普罗大众接种 ‎那是严重违反科学伦理的
to roll out a vaccine potentially to the entire global population,

235
00:12:51,60 --> 00:12:53,81
‎因为你可能会造成真正的伤害
because you could do some real harm there.

236
00:12:55,02 --> 00:12:57,48
‎今天 我们的士兵不必担心黄热病了
[news reel announcer] Our men today are safe against yellow fever.

237
00:12:57,56 --> 00:13:01,86
‎几滴疫苗 ‎就能带给他们可靠长效的免疫
A few drops of vaccine will give them dependable and lasting immunity.

238
00:13:02,69 --> 00:13:06,49
‎二战期间 ‎同盟国士兵接种了黄热病疫苗
[narrator] During World War II,

250
00:13:04,11 --> 00:13:06,91
Allied soldiers were vaccinated for yellow fever.

239
00:13:07,36 --> 00:13:11,20
‎数千人罹患黄疸和肝炎 有人死亡
Thousands developed jaundice and hepatitis, and some died.

240
00:13:11,74 --> 00:13:13,16
‎这本是可以避免的
That should never have happened.

241
00:13:13,25 --> 00:13:15,83
‎疫苗开发者如果做了研究
If the vaccine makers had done their research,

242
00:13:15,92 --> 00:13:19,96
‎他们就会发现 ‎早在1885年就有此类不良反应的报告
they would have discovered reports of these side effects dating back to 1885.

243
00:13:21,05 --> 00:13:22,71
‎到了20世纪50年代
Then in the 1950s,

244
00:13:22,80 --> 00:13:27,01
‎劣质疫苗导致四万人感染脊髓灰质炎
some poorly made vaccines infected 40,000 people with polio,

245
00:13:27,09 --> 00:13:28,76
‎约200人死亡
and killed around 200.

246
00:13:29,26 --> 00:13:30,89
‎史称卡特事件
Known as "the Cutter incident,"

247
00:13:30,97 --> 00:13:35,14
‎美国政府随后 ‎加强了对疫苗生产的监管
it led the US government to tighten requirements for vaccine manufacturers.

248
00:13:35,68 --> 00:13:41,82
‎未经严格的安全考察 绝不会审批
Nothing is licensed without undergoing extremely stringent safety considerations.

249
00:13:41,90 --> 00:13:45,28
‎即便是审批之后 也继续受到监督
And even after it's licensed, the vaccine continues to be monitored.

250
00:13:45,36 --> 00:13:47,70
‎今天 根据美国政府数据
[narrator] Today, according to the US government,

251
00:13:47,78 --> 00:13:50,74
‎每投放百万份疫苗
for every million doses of vaccine that are distributed,

252
00:13:50,83 --> 00:13:54,37
‎只有一个人因严重不良反应得到赔偿
only one person is compensated for serious side effects.

253
00:13:55,20 --> 00:14:00,08
‎疫苗的审批门槛极高 ‎因为接种它的是健康的人
Vaccines need to pass an extra-high bar because they're given to healthy people.

254
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:04,71
‎关系到安全和效果 我们不能走捷径
[Hatchett] What we can't do is take shortcuts

267
00:14:02,75 --> 00:14:04,80
where safety and effectiveness are concerned.

255
00:14:04,80 --> 00:14:07,09
‎我想有办法精简一些环节
I think there are ways to streamline some things

256
00:14:07,17 --> 00:14:08,51
‎更多工作可以同步进行
and do more things in parallel,

257
00:14:08,59 --> 00:14:10,05
‎但这会很难
but it's going to be tough,

258
00:14:10,14 --> 00:14:13,06
‎好比精心编排的舞蹈
and it's going to be a carefully orchestrated dance.

259
00:14:13,14 --> 00:14:15,72
‎不是一件事完成再做下一件事
Rather than running everything in series

260
00:14:15,81 --> 00:14:19,14
‎也不是一个人去做所有的步骤
and having just one person doing each of these steps along the way,

261
00:14:19,23 --> 00:14:21,11
‎而是投入整个团队
whole teams of people have been put there

‎确保维持同样的质量和安全标准
to ensure that we still maintain the same quality and safety.

263
00:14:26,32 --> 00:14:28,74
‎但是 有的团队有先发优势
[narrator] But some teams did have a head start here,

264
00:14:28,82 --> 00:14:31,24
‎因为这不是第一个冠状病毒
because this isn't the first coronavirus,

265
00:14:31,32 --> 00:14:35,04
‎也不是 ‎第一个引发疫苗竞赛的冠状病毒
or the first coronavirus to inspire a race for a vaccine.

Because it was similar,

279
00:15:17,66 --> 00:15:22,58
‎科研团队可以比较容易地把 ‎他们的MERS疫苗改造成新冠肺炎疫苗
the team easily adapted their MERS vaccine into a COVID-19 one.

280
00:15:22,67 --> 00:15:26,46
‎我们走了一条重要的捷径
And so that has really been a major shortcut that we've had,

281
00:15:26,55 --> 00:15:29,05
‎而不需要再回去 从一张白纸开始
by not having to go back to the drawing board and start again.

282
00:15:29,13 --> 00:15:31,47
‎他们快速通过一期试验
[narrator] They sped through the first phase of trials,

283
00:15:31,55 --> 00:15:34,68
‎准备今年夏天进入后续试验阶段
putting them on track to begin the next phases in the summer.

284
00:15:34,76 --> 00:15:37,60
‎我们不确定 ‎是不是一切都能按计划进行
We don't know for certain that that will all go to plan,

285
00:15:37,68 --> 00:15:40,02
‎但是如果一切顺利 那么今年秋天
but if it does, then it's certainly possible

286
00:15:40,10 --> 00:15:42,52
‎完全可能会有几百万份疫苗生产出来
that there could be millions of doses available in the autumn.

287
00:15:43,02 --> 00:15:46,02
‎很不幸 牛津大学的故事并不普遍
[narrator] Unfortunately, Oxford's story is uncommon.

288
00:15:46,52 --> 00:15:51,65
‎彼得候特茲几年前也研制出一种 ‎很有希望的非典疫苗
Peter Hotez also made a promising coronavirus vaccine for SARS years ago.

289
00:15:51,74 --> 00:15:55,20
‎一切都很顺利 可是后来 经费中断了
It was all going well, and then the grant ended.

290
00:15:55,28 --> 00:15:57,03
‎我们想 “都走了这么远了
And we thought, "Well, we've gone this far.

291
00:15:57,12 --> 00:16:00,41
‎我们只好再筹钱 ‎把它推进到临床阶段”
We'll just get funding to move it into clinical trials."

292
00:16:00,50 --> 00:16:01,96
‎很遗憾 我们筹不到钱
And unfortunately, we couldn't.

293
00:16:02,41 --> 00:16:04,88
‎很多很有希望的疫苗就这样夭折了
[narrator] This happened to so many promising vaccines

294
00:16:04,96 --> 00:16:08,30
‎这个阶段因此也被称为 ‎“疫苗的死亡之谷”
that this stage is often called "the Vaccine Valley of Death."

295
00:16:08,92 --> 00:16:10,46
‎这些科学家以破纪录的速度
Of these vaccine candidates

296
00:16:10,55 --> 00:16:12,80
‎研制的备选疫苗
that scientists race to make in record time,

297
00:16:12,88 --> 00:16:15,05
‎只有埃博拉疫苗跑到了终点
only Ebola reached the finish line.

298
00:16:15,14 --> 00:16:18,68
‎因为一旦疫情结束 资金也就中断了
Because when these outbreaks ended, so did the funding.

299
00:16:18,76 --> 00:16:22,23
‎每次灾难性的疫情之后
After every catastrophic pandemic or epidemic,

300
00:16:22,31 --> 00:16:24,81
‎我都会说： ‎“也许这一次终于能看到改变了
I say, "Maybe this is the one that moves the needle

301
00:16:24,90 --> 00:16:27,40
‎终于能看到公共财政拨款了”
and gets public funding in place."

302
00:16:27,48 --> 00:16:29,82
‎2003年非典之后我就这么说
And I said that after SARS in 2003,

303
00:16:29,90 --> 00:16:33,24
‎2009年H1N1之后我又这么说
I said it after H1N1 in 2009,

304
00:16:33,32 --> 00:16:35,53
‎2012年MERS之后 我又这么说
I said it after MERS in 2012,

305
00:16:35,61 --> 00:16:37,66
‎2014年埃博拉之后 我又这么说
I said it after Ebola in 2014,

306
00:16:37,74 --> 00:16:39,95
‎2016年兹卡病毒之后 我又这么说
after Zika in 2016, and I'll say it again.

307
00:16:40,49 --> 00:16:44,08
‎彼得的新冠肺炎疫苗是 ‎基于他的非典疫苗改造而成的
[narrator] Peter's COVID-19 candidate is based on his SARS candidate.

308
00:16:44,16 --> 00:16:46,50
‎但如果当年就能进行测试
But if he had been able to test it back then...

309
00:16:47,04 --> 00:16:49,42
‎我们现在可能已经做完安全测试了
We would have had the safety testing potentially finished,

310
00:16:49,50 --> 00:16:51,38
‎那就非同小可 是不是？
and that's not insignificant, right?

311
00:16:51,46 --> 00:16:55,68
‎所以 我们失去了那个机会 太可惜了
So that's too bad that we lost that opportunity.

312
00:16:56,26 --> 00:16:57,80
‎2017年
[narrator] In 2017,

313
00:16:57,89 --> 00:17:00,18
‎在盖茨基金会的部分资助下 一群人
a group of people funded in part by the Gates Foundation

314
00:17:00,26 --> 00:17:02,35
‎聚集一堂 尝试解决这个问题
came together to fix this.

315
00:17:02,43 --> 00:17:06,02
‎很不幸 虽然各种疫病流行的
Well, unfortunately, even though there's a substantial risk

316
00:17:06,10 --> 00:17:07,90
‎风险很高
of various types of epidemics,

317
00:17:07,98 --> 00:17:12,19
‎但是人们却没有足够动力 ‎去生产出防患未然的产品
there's not a natural incentive for people to build products that anticipate that.

318
00:17:12,28 --> 00:17:16,24
‎我们必须把政府和基金会整合起来
You've got to bring governments and foundations together

319
00:17:16,32 --> 00:17:18,41
‎创造一个合理的激励机制
to create the right incentive structure.

320
00:17:18,87 --> 00:17:20,58
‎他们把这个组织命名为CEPI
[narrator] They call themselves CEPI,

321
00:17:20,66 --> 00:17:23,50
‎流行病预防创新联盟
The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.

322
00:17:23,91 --> 00:17:28,83
‎CEPI的作用就是把资金整合起来 ‎成为一个资金池
[Hatchett] What CEPI is,

337
00:17:25,66 --> 00:17:28,83
is it aggregates funding and creates a pool of funds

323
00:17:28,92 --> 00:17:31,05
‎去支持疫苗的研发
to support vaccine development.

324
00:17:31,13 --> 00:17:32,71
‎这样 我们可以作为诚实中间人
So we can play fair broker

325
00:17:32,80 --> 00:17:36,18
‎拿着这笔几十亿美元的资金 ‎确保在世界范围内
and take those billions that are available for tools for the world

326
00:17:36,26 --> 00:17:38,09
‎把它用在正确的地方
and make sure they go to the right place.

327
00:17:38,55 --> 00:17:42,26
‎截至五月初 已有九个 ‎新冠肺炎备选疫苗获得CEPI支持
[narrator] As of early May, CEPI is behind nine COVID-19 candidates,

328
00:17:42,35 --> 00:17:44,31
‎包括两个领先的疫苗：
including two of the early front-runners:

329
00:17:44,39 --> 00:17:47,02
‎牛津大学的新疫苗和莫德纳疫苗
Oxford's new candidate, and Moderna's.

330
00:17:47,10 --> 00:17:50,61
‎这两种疫苗 ‎以及一种中国疫苗的成功
And it's the success of those two candidates,

346
00:17:49,44 --> 00:17:50,61
and one from China,

331
00:17:50,69 --> 00:17:55,11
‎让专家看到希望 认为18个月后 ‎就可能有一种疫苗获得批准
that give experts hope that we can have a vaccine approved in 18 months,

332
00:17:55,19 --> 00:17:57,45
‎但这还不是竞赛的终点
but that isn't the end of the race.

333
00:17:57,53 --> 00:17:58,82
‎还差得远呢
Not even close.

350
00:17:59,53 --> 00:18:00,70
[car engines roaring]

334
00:18:00,78 --> 00:18:02,53

‎加速前进 轮胎几乎起火
burning tires down to the fabric as they pour on the coal.

336
00:18:06,91 --> 00:18:10,92
‎别忘了 要终结这场全球大流行病 ‎我们需要达到群体免疫
[narrator] Remember, to end this pandemic, we need to reach herd immunity.

337
00:18:11,46 --> 00:18:14,05
‎针对这种冠状病毒 专家估计
And for this coronavirus, experts estimate

338
00:18:14,13 --> 00:18:18,13
‎需要全世界至少60%的人口实现免疫
that means at least 60% of the world needs to become immune.

339
00:18:18,22 --> 00:18:22,14
‎那就是将近80亿人的60%
That's 60% of almost eight billion people.

340
00:18:22,22 --> 00:18:23,85
‎需要生产几十亿支疫苗？
[interviewer] Billions of vaccines need to be made?

341
00:18:23,93 --> 00:18:24,97
‎是的
That's correct.

342
00:18:25,06 --> 00:18:29,77
‎在世界历史上 ‎我们从来没有生产过十亿支疫苗
We've never produced a billion doses of a vaccine in the history of the world.

343
00:18:29,85 --> 00:18:33,36
‎数十亿支疫苗 这是破天荒的
[Gates] You're in a new regime when you talk about billions of a vaccine.

344
00:18:33,44 --> 00:18:35,40
‎我们任何疫苗也没有量产过几十亿支
We don't make billions of any vaccine.

345
00:18:35,48 --> 00:18:36,65
‎我们可以生产几亿支
We make hundreds of millions,

346
00:18:36,74 --> 00:18:40,11
‎但那也需要几十年 就连药瓶
but those we've had decades to work on. And even the bottles,

347
00:18:40,74 --> 00:18:43,16
‎也是特殊的药品级玻璃
that's a special, pharmaceutical-grade glass,

348
00:18:43,24 --> 00:18:44,58
‎世界上没有那么多
the world doesn't have enough of that.

349
00:18:45,08 --> 00:18:46,04
‎首先
[narrator] Just to start with,

350
00:18:46,12 --> 00:18:49,54
‎要生产十亿支疫苗 ‎你需要有很多工厂
to make a billion doses, you need a lot of factories.

351
00:18:49,62 --> 00:18:53,42
‎但是每种疫苗都需要不同类型的工厂
But each type of vaccine requires a different kind of factory,

352
00:18:53,50 --> 00:18:57,17
‎要让足够多的工厂提高产量 ‎可能需要几年时间
and ramping up production in enough factories can take years.

353
00:18:57,26 --> 00:18:59,26
‎不过 很多大型制药企业有条捷径
But a lot of the giants have a shortcut.

354
00:18:59,34 --> 00:19:02,09
‎他们让工厂现在就开工生产
They have the factories to start production now.

355
00:19:02,18 --> 00:19:04,76
‎我们有一个大工厂 完全可以开工
We have one big plant which is fully operational.

356
00:19:04,85 --> 00:19:08,85
‎可以产出三亿支疫苗
So that can spit out 300 million vaccines.

357
00:19:08,93 --> 00:19:13,73
‎现在 我们正在世界各地 ‎快速建设新工厂
Now we are very quickly setting up additional plants in the world.

358
00:19:14,27 --> 00:19:18,28
‎但是 较新型的疫苗 ‎没有几家工厂能生产 甚至根本没有
[narrator] But the newer types of vaccines don't have many, or any, factories yet,

359
00:19:18,57 --> 00:19:21,53
‎所以 有人已经开始在 ‎不同的备选疫苗上下注
so some are placing bets on candidates now,

360
00:19:21,61 --> 00:19:25,20
‎为他们认为有可能通过测试的疫苗 ‎筹建工厂
building factories for the ones they think might survive trials.

361
00:19:25,28 --> 00:19:30,29
‎毕竟 那些投资至多几十亿 ‎却可以省下几万亿
After all, those investments are, at most, billions to save trillions.

362
00:19:30,79 --> 00:19:33,13
‎就算我们可以生产出那么多疫苗
[narrator] And even if we can make that many doses,

363
00:19:33,21 --> 00:19:36,63
‎我们还需要把疫苗送到 ‎世界各地的人们那里
we'll still need to get the vaccine to people all over the world,

364
00:19:36,71 --> 00:19:39,13
‎这时候 政治因素就会成为障碍
and that's when politics can get in the way.

365
00:19:40,47 --> 00:19:44,76
‎我们有一种疫苗 我们相信能保护
[Andrew Cuthbertson] We have a specific vaccine that we believe

366
00:19:44,85 --> 00:19:48,68
‎数百万人不被新型H1N1病毒感染
will be able to protect millions of people against this new H1N1 flu.

367
00:19:48,77 --> 00:19:51,85
‎2009年猪流感疫情期间
[narrator] During the swine flu epidemic in 2009,

368
00:19:51,94 --> 00:19:55,27
‎一家澳大利亚公司率先研制出疫苗
an Australian company was among the first to make a vaccine,

369
00:19:55,36 --> 00:19:58,40
‎政府要求他们首先卖给澳大利亚人
and the government made them sell to Australians first.

370
00:19:59,11 --> 00:20:01,07
‎加拿大也采取类似做法
Canada made a similar move.

371
00:20:01,74 --> 00:20:04,91
‎尽管美国承诺捐赠一部分
And while the US promised to donate some of its supply,

372
00:20:04,99 --> 00:20:07,33
‎但他们直到疫情结束才捐出
they waited until the epidemic was over.

373
00:20:08,04 --> 00:20:10,95
‎所以 疫苗在哪里生产 很重要
So it matters where a vaccine is made.

374
00:20:11,46 --> 00:20:13,21
‎疫苗民族主义
Vaccine nationalism. That is real.

376
00:20:14,25 --> 00:20:17,17
‎已经有迹象表明 ‎有人想买下正在研发最有希望的
There are early signs that people are trying to buy by the biotech companies

377
00:20:17,25 --> 00:20:18,71
‎疫苗的生物科技公司
that have lead contenders.

378
00:20:18,80 --> 00:20:20,92
‎狭隘地把国家利益摆在最优先位置
There's a long tradition of narrowly putting

379
00:20:21,01 --> 00:20:22,67
‎这种做法由来已久
national interest above others,

380
00:20:22,76 --> 00:20:25,89
‎显然 这样做的人通常是有钱人
and that's obviously often correlated with people who have the money.

381
00:20:26,05 --> 00:20:29,56
‎世界各国领导人联合呼吁展开合作
[narrator] World leaders have come together

398
00:20:28,01 --> 00:20:29,56
and called for cooperation.

382
00:20:29,64 --> 00:20:31,10
‎科学无国界
[in German] Science is never national. Science serves mankind.

385
00:20:33,89 --> 00:20:37,69
‎大家承诺确保机会均等 这是关键
[in English] The commitment to ensuring equal access is the key.

386
00:20:37,77 --> 00:20:40,69
‎在全世界有需要的人
Victory against this virus cannot be declared

387
00:20:40,78 --> 00:20:44,40
‎都能获得有效的疫苗和药品之前
before effective vaccines and therapeutics are made available

388
00:20:44,49 --> 00:20:46,49
‎不能说针对病毒的战斗已经胜利
to all in need around the world.

389
00:20:47,12 --> 00:20:48,45
‎可是截至5月
[narrator] But as of May, the US hasn't been one of them.

391
00:20:52,62 --> 00:20:56,42
‎谁能得到疫苗 也取决于价格
Who can get a vaccine will also depend on its price.

392
00:20:56,50 --> 00:20:58,88
‎要多少钱？富裕国家应该多花钱吗？
How much should it cost? Should rich countries pay more?

393
00:20:58,96 --> 00:21:00,96
‎贫穷国家应该少付一点吗？
Should, you know, poorer countries pay less?

394
00:21:01,05 --> 00:21:05,09
‎另外 如果疫苗是 ‎一家大型制药公司研发的
And also, if this vaccine is developed by a major pharmaceutical company,

395
00:21:05,18 --> 00:21:08,18
‎这家公司应该被允许 ‎通过疫苗获得多少收益？
how much money is this company allowed to make off this vaccine?

396
00:21:09,01 --> 00:21:12,43
‎别忘了 这些疫苗多数是私人资助的
[narrator] Remember, most of these vaccines are funded privately,

397
00:21:12,52 --> 00:21:15,64
‎根据一些疫苗制造者的股价上涨情况
and based on how some vaccine makers' stocks have risen,

398
00:21:15,73 --> 00:21:18,86
‎很显然 有些人要发大财了
some people clearly see a potential windfall ahead.

399
00:21:19,36 --> 00:21:22,44
‎但目前 一些公司 比如强生
But so far, some companies like Johnson & Johnson

400
00:21:22,53 --> 00:21:25,20
‎已经承诺廉价销售他们的疫苗
have promised to make their vaccine affordable,

401
00:21:25,28 --> 00:21:27,03
‎低至每支10美元
as little as $10 a dose.

402
00:21:27,61 --> 00:21:33,66
‎这很关键 因为只有接种到几十亿人 ‎疫苗才算成功了
And that's critical, because a vaccine can only win if it gets to billions of people,

403
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:36,00
‎其中包括向那些无力购买的人提供
including those who can't afford it.

404
00:21:36,08 --> 00:21:38,04
‎要让全世界足够多的人接种
So to vaccinate enough of the world,

405
00:21:38,50 --> 00:21:40,96
‎我们需要不止一个优胜者

‎这个让经济停滞 ‎让全世界数十万人丧生的
that simple little vehicle that's paralyzed economies

‎简单的生物信息载体
and ended hundreds of thousands of lives around the world.
