00:00:06,00 --> 00:00:07,75
-[siren wailing in distance]
-[footsteps]

2
00:00:07,84 --> 00:00:11,51
[woman 1] I am absolutely terrified
of going outside.

3
00:00:12,13 --> 00:00:14,68
I don't go outside for walks.

4
00:00:14,76 --> 00:00:17,22
When I see people, I automatically think

5
00:00:17,30 --> 00:00:20,10
that they're sick
and they want to get me sick.

6
00:00:20,18 --> 00:00:23,18
[woman 2]
I've been washing my hands obsessively.

7
00:00:23,27 --> 00:00:25,69
I've been disinfecting light switches

8
00:00:25,77 --> 00:00:29,19
and doorknobs in my house
multiple times a day.

9
00:00:29,27 --> 00:00:30,94
[man] I see threats everywhere.

10
00:00:31,03 --> 00:00:33,74
Everywhere I look, I see virus particles.

11
00:00:34,24 --> 00:00:38,16
We need to experience fear
in this situation.

12
00:00:38,24 --> 00:00:41,45
Fear is there to help us survive.

13
00:00:41,54 --> 00:00:44,75
Fear is there to help us
prepare for danger.

14
00:00:44,83 --> 00:00:47,42
[narrator] It drives us
to follow the rules.

15
00:00:47,50 --> 00:00:53,01
Staying home, washing our hands,
wearing a mask, and keeping our distance.

16
00:00:53,42 --> 00:00:56,93
But fear that starts out as productive
can stack up.

17
00:00:57,01 --> 00:01:00,01
The anxiety that comes along
with having a four-month-old

18
00:01:00,10 --> 00:01:02,89
and not wanting her to get the virus.

19
00:01:02,97 --> 00:01:06,81
[in Russian] My business has
completely stopped dead, just halted.

20
00:01:06,90 --> 00:01:08,94
[in English]
Juggling household work, office work...

21
00:01:09,02 --> 00:01:13,19
homeschooling...
Just making sure every need is met.

22
00:01:13,28 --> 00:01:18,45
[in Italian] I regret not being able
to attend the last semester of university.

23
00:01:18,53 --> 00:01:20,66
[in English] We would love to see
lots of people, obviously,

24
00:01:20,74 --> 00:01:21,95
but that's an impossibility.

25
00:01:22,04 --> 00:01:25,50
Nobody knows what's happening
in the future. It's all very uncertain.

26
00:01:25,58 --> 00:01:28,33
You don't know where it is
and when it's going to bite you.

27
00:01:28,42 --> 00:01:29,46
It's...

28
00:01:30,96 --> 00:01:32,34
very powerful.

29
00:01:32,42 --> 00:01:34,21
I think that what we're seeing now

30
00:01:34,30 --> 00:01:37,01
is that we are all more the same
than we are different.

31
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:42,97
We have, um, similar fears,
similar hopes, similar dreams...

32
00:01:43,56 --> 00:01:45,35
[narrator] Because rarely in history

33
00:01:45,43 --> 00:01:48,52
have so many of us faced
the same crises all at once.

34
00:01:49,10 --> 00:01:51,98
In the US, a few months into the outbreak,

35
00:01:52,07 --> 00:01:56,44
a third of people were experiencing
high psychological distress,

36
00:01:56,53 --> 00:02:00,62
and in China, half of the doctors
and nurses reported depression.

37
00:02:01,07 --> 00:02:03,28
Almost as many reported anxiety.

38
00:02:03,70 --> 00:02:06,16
And in past collective crises,

39
00:02:06,25 --> 00:02:07,87
like terrorist attacks,

40
00:02:07,96 --> 00:02:10,79
natural disasters, and other epidemics,

41
00:02:10,88 --> 00:02:12,71
people struggled
with these kind of effects

42
00:02:12,79 --> 00:02:14,71
even a year or more later.

43
00:02:16,55 --> 00:02:19,05
The stress many of us
are experiencing right now

44
00:02:19,13 --> 00:02:22,76
could stay with us long after
the pandemic itself is over,

45
00:02:23,18 --> 00:02:24,72
but it doesn't have to.

46
00:02:25,01 --> 00:02:27,10
Coping is preventative care.

47
00:02:27,35 --> 00:02:31,23
Small things we do today
can help protect us in the future.

48
00:02:31,94 --> 00:02:33,94
So what does that look like?

49
00:02:34,65 --> 00:02:36,03
How do we cope?

50
00:02:36,57 --> 00:02:39,32
I want the fear to stop.
I want the anxiety to stop.

51
00:02:39,40 --> 00:02:40,24
[sirens blaring]

52
00:02:40,32 --> 00:02:41,41
[theme music playing]

53
00:02:41,49 --> 00:02:47,75
You can physically isolate, but you don't
have to emotionally and socially isolate.

54
00:02:47,83 --> 00:02:48,66
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

55
00:02:48,75 --> 00:02:49,58
[exhaling]

56
00:02:49,66 --> 00:02:52,83
We have to work together
to address this issue.

57
00:02:53,59 --> 00:02:54,42
[knocking]

58
00:02:54,50 --> 00:02:55,63
Grocery delivery.

59
00:02:55,71 --> 00:02:57,88
This is happening.
We can't let it bring us down.

60
00:02:57,96 --> 00:02:59,92
-[all cheering]
-I love my community...

61
00:03:00,01 --> 00:03:01,55
and I feel like we are one.

62
00:03:02,59 --> 00:03:04,60
[theme music continues]

63
00:03:11,94 --> 00:03:14,81
[narrator] Calmness is your resting state,

64
00:03:14,90 --> 00:03:16,32
a state of balance.

65
00:03:16,77 --> 00:03:18,69
And stress is the opposite.

66
00:03:19,65 --> 00:03:22,16
Coping means restoring that balance.

67
00:03:22,45 --> 00:03:27,29
So to learn how, it helps to understand
the system that controls it.

68
00:03:28,75 --> 00:03:32,25
When your brain perceives a threat,
it sounds an alarm,

69
00:03:32,33 --> 00:03:33,92
using your nervous system,

70
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:38,09
a network of wires that zip
electrical messages around your body.

71
00:03:38,17 --> 00:03:42,18
The autonomic nervous system is
that part of it that takes care of things

72
00:03:42,26 --> 00:03:44,89
automatically for you
without you thinking about it.

73
00:03:44,97 --> 00:03:48,18
[narrator] It connects your brain
to nearly all your major organs,

74
00:03:48,26 --> 00:03:51,68
and it can be divided
into two opposing systems.

75
00:03:51,77 --> 00:03:53,39
The sympathetic nervous system

76
00:03:53,48 --> 00:03:55,65
-tells your body when it's on high alert,
-[animal growls]

77
00:03:55,73 --> 00:04:00,28
while the parasympathetic nervous system
tells your body when it's okay to relax.

78
00:04:01,15 --> 00:04:03,24
-One is like a gas pedal,
-[car accelerating]

79
00:04:03,32 --> 00:04:05,20
and the other is the brakes.

80
00:04:05,28 --> 00:04:06,62
[car braking]

81
00:04:07,03 --> 00:04:09,70
[narrator] When you're calm,
they are in constant push and pull,

82
00:04:09,79 --> 00:04:11,29
keeping each other in check.

83
00:04:11,54 --> 00:04:15,08
But when you're stressed,
the sympathetic nerves take over.

84
00:04:15,17 --> 00:04:19,92
Your adrenal glands release
stress hormones, adrenaline, and cortisol.

85
00:04:20,00 --> 00:04:21,30
Your heart rate rises.

86
00:04:21,38 --> 00:04:24,88
Your liver releases sugar into your blood,
giving you a burst of energy.

87
00:04:24,97 --> 00:04:28,51
Your breathing speeds up,
muscles tense for action, and then,

88
00:04:28,60 --> 00:04:32,27
once you're finished fighting or fleeing,
your body goes back to normal.

89
00:04:32,85 --> 00:04:36,31
The problem is, it doesn't matter
whether it's a physical threat

90
00:04:36,40 --> 00:04:38,11
or more abstract one.

91
00:04:38,31 --> 00:04:41,82
Your brain will mobilize
the exact same response.

92
00:04:41,90 --> 00:04:45,95
And the threats we're facing right now
aren't the kind you can outrun.

93
00:04:46,03 --> 00:04:47,24
When I found out in the morning

94
00:04:47,32 --> 00:04:49,20
that I was gonna have to be
admitted to the hospital

95
00:04:49,28 --> 00:04:50,79
and that I was gonna be admitted alone,

96
00:04:50,87 --> 00:04:52,83
that I wouldn't be able
to have any visitors,

97
00:04:52,91 --> 00:04:54,96
I think all of it just came crashing down.

98
00:04:55,04 --> 00:04:56,79
I started sobbing and shaking

99
00:04:56,87 --> 00:05:00,46
and, I mean, kind of
a classic panic attack. I couldn't stop.

100
00:05:00,84 --> 00:05:05,09
It's been really tough for my anxiety,
'cause I have sickle cell disease.

101
00:05:05,17 --> 00:05:07,30
I'm more prone to catching infection.

102
00:05:07,55 --> 00:05:10,81
And I don't really have, like,

103
00:05:10,89 --> 00:05:13,77
the tolerance to be able to, like,
stand COVID if I caught it.

104
00:05:14,14 --> 00:05:19,61
This has been unlike anything
I have ever experienced in my training.

105
00:05:19,69 --> 00:05:23,15
To have to do
all of these difficult conversations

106
00:05:23,23 --> 00:05:25,32
with families over the phone,

107
00:05:25,40 --> 00:05:29,57
for family members not to be
at the bedside with their loved ones.

108
00:05:30,24 --> 00:05:32,08
I mean, it's just been...

109
00:05:32,91 --> 00:05:34,95
incredibly difficult.

110
00:05:35,04 --> 00:05:38,37
Our bodies and minds weren't designed
for chronic stress.

111
00:05:38,83 --> 00:05:41,63
They were designed
for these kinds of short-term stressors,

112
00:05:41,71 --> 00:05:45,01
and all of the adrenaline
and other chemicals that are released

113
00:05:45,09 --> 00:05:47,51
get worked out
by the fighting or the fleeing.

114
00:05:48,47 --> 00:05:52,56
[van der Kolk] If there's nothing
 your body can do to take care of things,

115
00:05:52,64 --> 00:05:55,39
then the energy to do something
stays in your body,

116
00:05:55,48 --> 00:05:57,89
and it gets translated into agitation.

117
00:05:57,98 --> 00:06:01,06
[narrator] And the things we normally do
to ease the agitation

118
00:06:01,15 --> 00:06:04,07
can be a lot harder during a pandemic.

119
00:06:04,15 --> 00:06:07,40
Video chats are great,
but it's... it's not the same.

120
00:06:07,95 --> 00:06:12,03
That physical component of being, um...

121
00:06:12,24 --> 00:06:16,83
connected to others is something that
we just really don't have right now.

122
00:06:17,29 --> 00:06:20,17
[narrator] Even the things we can do
to feel better

123
00:06:20,25 --> 00:06:23,21
become more difficult when we're stressed.

124
00:06:23,71 --> 00:06:27,09
A lot of insomnia, a lot of anxiety
at night, difficulty sleeping.

125
00:06:27,17 --> 00:06:30,89
[in Spanish] I find myself having trouble
falling asleep.

126
00:06:30,97 --> 00:06:32,51
[in English]
I've been sleeping pretty bad.

127
00:06:33,10 --> 00:06:35,52
2:00 a.m., and I can't sleep.

128
00:06:36,06 --> 00:06:38,18
[Levitin] It's often hard to sleep
when we're stressed

129
00:06:38,27 --> 00:06:40,81
because we've got adrenaline
coursing through our veins

130
00:06:40,90 --> 00:06:42,65
which serves to keep us awake.

131
00:06:43,02 --> 00:06:45,61
It also can be because
we're ruminating.

132
00:06:45,69 --> 00:06:47,82
Our brains won't turn off.

133
00:06:47,90 --> 00:06:49,65
I can't really think about being creative

134
00:06:49,74 --> 00:06:53,62
when I have to worry about how I'm gonna
eventually have to pay some my bills,

135
00:06:53,70 --> 00:06:57,79
or when this stuff is gonna end,
or my health and potentially catching it.

136
00:06:58,29 --> 00:07:01,00
[narrator] A stressed brain
has one priority:

137
00:07:01,21 --> 00:07:03,79
getting you ready to fight or flee.

138
00:07:03,88 --> 00:07:07,26
So coping begins with convincing
your brain that you're safe,

139
00:07:07,34 --> 00:07:09,97
and the easiest way to do that is by...

140
00:07:10,05 --> 00:07:12,05
[deep inhale]

141
00:07:12,59 --> 00:07:13,89
[exhale]

142
00:07:14,64 --> 00:07:18,35
[narrator] Usually it's your brain
that decides when it's safe to relax.

143
00:07:18,43 --> 00:07:20,06
But when you breathe deeply,

144
00:07:20,14 --> 00:07:23,48
the message of safety
gets passed back up the line,

145
00:07:23,56 --> 00:07:26,77
and your parasympathetic nerves
become more active.

146
00:07:27,15 --> 00:07:31,24
It's like a cheat code,
forcing your system back into balance.

147
00:07:32,24 --> 00:07:36,49
We can actually measure this, too,
through the gaps in our heartbeats.

148
00:07:37,62 --> 00:07:40,37
When you're calm, the gaps are more varied

149
00:07:40,46 --> 00:07:43,92
because of that push and pull
between your gas pedal and your brakes.

150
00:07:44,25 --> 00:07:48,67
You have a higher heart rate variability,
or HRV.

151
00:07:49,01 --> 00:07:51,30
But when your sympathetic
nervous system takes over,

152
00:07:51,38 --> 00:07:54,59
the spaces become shorter
and more regular,

153
00:07:54,68 --> 00:07:57,01
a much lower HRV.

154
00:07:57,72 --> 00:07:58,85
So let's try it.

155
00:07:59,39 --> 00:08:00,93
Breathe in for five.

156
00:08:02,10 --> 00:08:03,23
Hold it.

157
00:08:03,52 --> 00:08:04,73
Breathe out for five.

158
00:08:04,85 --> 00:08:06,86
[exhales]

159
00:08:09,36 --> 00:08:12,36
[narrator] The average person takes
12 to 20 breaths a minute,

160
00:08:13,03 --> 00:08:15,87
but slowing that down to six breaths

161
00:08:15,95 --> 00:08:18,62
can significantly increase your HRV.

162
00:08:19,74 --> 00:08:23,79
Counting the intake
and counting the exhale...

163
00:08:23,87 --> 00:08:27,17
It did make me feel better
to do the deep breathing.

164
00:08:27,25 --> 00:08:30,25
[narrator] Controlled breathing
gets easier with practice.

165
00:08:30,34 --> 00:08:32,13
Like working out your muscles,

166
00:08:32,22 --> 00:08:35,47
you can train your nervous system
to bear more weight.

167
00:08:36,72 --> 00:08:39,68
But breathing can only get you so far

168
00:08:40,22 --> 00:08:43,10
when you're constantly facing
new reasons to be stressed.

169
00:08:43,18 --> 00:08:45,35
-[reporter 1] But this COVID-19 crisis...
-[reporter 2] Italy shut down...

170
00:08:45,44 --> 00:08:47,23
-[reporter 3] Mass layoffs...
-[man] ...death count.

171
00:08:47,31 --> 00:08:51,28
[narrator] But you can avoid doing things
that may cause unnecessary stress.

172
00:08:52,11 --> 00:08:56,45
Watching more TV news during
other traumatic world events, like 9/11,

173
00:08:56,53 --> 00:09:00,24
was associated with higher rates
of serious stress.

174
00:09:00,33 --> 00:09:03,91
Instead of being glued to the news,

175
00:09:04,37 --> 00:09:08,04
just have a plan
for how you're gonna get your news.

176
00:09:08,13 --> 00:09:12,13
I check the news once a day
and once a day only, and that's because

177
00:09:12,21 --> 00:09:15,42
I know that there's nothing else
that I'm going to read during the day

178
00:09:15,51 --> 00:09:17,13
that is going to change my behavior.

179
00:09:17,22 --> 00:09:19,35
It doesn't serve me in any way.

180
00:09:19,43 --> 00:09:21,93
That's gonna make it
just a little bit easier

181
00:09:22,01 --> 00:09:26,14
for you to hold on
to the uncertainty of this situation.

182
00:09:26,23 --> 00:09:29,86
[narrator] Some other popular
coping mechanisms don't serve you, either,

183
00:09:29,94 --> 00:09:31,44
like drinking.

184
00:09:31,52 --> 00:09:32,82
When the pandemic started,

185
00:09:32,90 --> 00:09:35,65
alcohol sales skyrocketed in the US,

186
00:09:35,74 --> 00:09:36,82
and in the UK,

187
00:09:36,90 --> 00:09:40,24
and Germany, and Russia,
and Finland, and China.

188
00:09:40,83 --> 00:09:43,20
Drinking may ease the stress
in the moment,

189
00:09:43,29 --> 00:09:46,79
but heavy drinking in the long term
can mess with your body's balance

190
00:09:46,87 --> 00:09:49,38
and make it harder to feel calm.

191
00:09:49,46 --> 00:09:52,00
[Gottlieb] We have a feeling,
we don't want to feel the feeling,

192
00:09:52,09 --> 00:09:55,42
and those things will immediately
obliterate the feeling.

193
00:09:55,51 --> 00:09:59,14
And the problem with that is
that numbness isn't nothingness.

194
00:09:59,22 --> 00:10:02,89
Numbness is being overwhelmed
by too many feelings.

195
00:10:03,72 --> 00:10:07,69
[narrator] To be calm, you need
to take back control of your feelings.

196
00:10:08,48 --> 00:10:10,86
Something that's really important
in resiliency

197
00:10:10,94 --> 00:10:14,44
is feeling like you have
some type of control in your life,

198
00:10:14,53 --> 00:10:16,28
some type of agency.

199
00:10:16,36 --> 00:10:21,49
And this is the exact thing that has been
torn away from so many of our lives.

200
00:10:21,57 --> 00:10:24,95
[narrator] We may even be hardwired
to hate uncertainty.

201
00:10:25,04 --> 00:10:28,91
In one study, scientists had people
play a simple game,

202
00:10:29,00 --> 00:10:30,33
while measuring their stress.

203
00:10:30,75 --> 00:10:32,54
Players were shown a rock,

204
00:10:32,63 --> 00:10:35,25
told to guess whether
there was a snake under that rock,

205
00:10:35,34 --> 00:10:37,21
and then to turn it over.

206
00:10:37,34 --> 00:10:39,97
If there was a snake,
they got a small electric shock.

207
00:10:40,05 --> 00:10:40,89
[electricity zapping]

208
00:10:41,84 --> 00:10:44,18
The snakes appeared in a kind of pattern.

209
00:10:44,26 --> 00:10:46,60
Some rocks would always have
a snake under them,

210
00:10:47,10 --> 00:10:49,10
some would never have a snake under them,

211
00:10:49,19 --> 00:10:52,52
and others would have a snake sometimes.

212
00:10:52,61 --> 00:10:54,02
And the surprising thing was,

213
00:10:54,11 --> 00:10:57,99
stress didn't spike when players knew
they were going to get shocked.

214
00:10:58,32 --> 00:11:01,86
It spiked when they weren't sure
whether the shock was coming.

215
00:11:03,49 --> 00:11:06,95
And that's what makes this pandemic
uniquely difficult.

216
00:11:07,66 --> 00:11:11,08
We don't know what shocks are coming,
or when.

217
00:11:11,96 --> 00:11:14,38
Am I gonna go back to my job?
Is everything gonna be normal?

218
00:11:14,75 --> 00:11:17,09
Am I gonna catch it? Am I gonna get sick?

219
00:11:17,96 --> 00:11:20,51
Like, it's a lot of anxiety
you're dealing with.

220
00:11:20,59 --> 00:11:22,76
You're dealing with
maintaining your well-being,

221
00:11:23,01 --> 00:11:26,43
but you also have to deal with
maintaining, like, your lifestyle.

222
00:11:26,51 --> 00:11:28,64
You have to pay rent,
you have to pay bills.

223
00:11:30,06 --> 00:11:31,69
How can you focus?

224
00:11:32,98 --> 00:11:34,94
[narrator]
Which brings us to number three.

225
00:11:35,27 --> 00:11:36,73
Reclaim agency.

226
00:11:36,98 --> 00:11:40,28
Once the world becomes
completely unpredictable,

227
00:11:40,36 --> 00:11:44,49
you have to create somewhat
of a predictable world for yourself.

228
00:11:44,57 --> 00:11:46,62
[narrator] Even small things can help,

229
00:11:46,70 --> 00:11:48,16
like keeping a schedule.

230
00:11:48,29 --> 00:11:50,71
That gives us a sense of purpose.

231
00:11:50,79 --> 00:11:54,04
"Why am I doing what I'm doing
in this moment?"

232
00:11:54,13 --> 00:11:57,96
And it gives us a sense of value
knowing that we have to get things done,

233
00:11:58,05 --> 00:11:59,55
we have to be somewhere.

234
00:11:59,63 --> 00:12:02,34
But I definitely, even on my days off,

235
00:12:02,43 --> 00:12:07,43
try to keep the routines
of getting up at a set time and

236
00:12:07,93 --> 00:12:09,93
keeping a list of the things
that I want to do

237
00:12:10,02 --> 00:12:13,06
so that it just doesn't feel like
this amorphous day.

238
00:12:13,14 --> 00:12:15,15
[narrator]
It can help to take care of something.

239
00:12:15,27 --> 00:12:18,57
I have my, uh, little gym here,

240
00:12:19,19 --> 00:12:20,28
and my cat.

241
00:12:20,36 --> 00:12:22,53
-You can see my beautiful cat.
-[meows]

242
00:12:22,65 --> 00:12:23,70
Huh? [chuckles]

243
00:12:23,78 --> 00:12:25,07
[narrator] Or make something.

244
00:12:25,16 --> 00:12:28,41
I just feel, like, more at peace
when I'm, like, designing stuff again.

245
00:12:28,49 --> 00:12:30,12
[narrator] Before the pandemic,

246
00:12:30,20 --> 00:12:33,00
Ayo had planned
to sell some of his designs,

247
00:12:33,54 --> 00:12:35,37
and in April, he did.

248
00:12:35,46 --> 00:12:39,55
I sold my shirts and
gave 20% from each shirt to charity,

249
00:12:39,92 --> 00:12:42,84
because although I'm, like, kind of, like,
dealing with my own stuff now,

250
00:12:42,92 --> 00:12:46,26
I can't forget that other people
do still need help.

251
00:12:46,34 --> 00:12:49,35
[narrator] Helping people engages
our brain's reward system

252
00:12:49,43 --> 00:12:51,43
and makes our levels of cortisol,

253
00:12:51,52 --> 00:12:54,02
one of the main stress hormones, plummet.

254
00:12:54,39 --> 00:12:57,77
Scientists call this sensation
"the helper's high,"

255
00:12:57,86 --> 00:13:00,61
and it doesn't just feel good,
it's good for you.

256
00:13:00,98 --> 00:13:02,28
Really good for you.

257
00:13:02,36 --> 00:13:06,24
One study checked on a group
of older people over several years.

258
00:13:06,32 --> 00:13:09,99
It found that volunteering had
a larger effect on longevity

259
00:13:10,08 --> 00:13:12,37
than exercising four times a week,

260
00:13:12,45 --> 00:13:15,58
and the impact was almost as great
as not smoking.

261
00:13:16,21 --> 00:13:18,17
Which brings us to number four.

262
00:13:18,67 --> 00:13:20,75
Shift the focus away from yourself.

263
00:13:21,30 --> 00:13:24,26
Part of what the pandemic
has brought to us is

264
00:13:24,34 --> 00:13:28,18
a revelation about what was not working
in our society.

265
00:13:28,84 --> 00:13:31,81
[narrator] A lot of ours stresses
right now aren't individual problems

266
00:13:31,89 --> 00:13:33,77
that we can solve individually.

267
00:13:34,52 --> 00:13:35,85
They're bigger than that.

268
00:13:36,44 --> 00:13:40,23
[Nelson] These include unemployment,
the potential for food insecurity,

269
00:13:40,77 --> 00:13:45,61
whether or not one has access to
healthcare resources and health insurance.

270
00:13:45,69 --> 00:13:49,32
[woman] We stand here with our brothers
and sisters in the public health system.

271
00:13:49,41 --> 00:13:53,37
I think we're learning
that people do need health insurance,

272
00:13:53,45 --> 00:13:55,04
they need to have predictability,

273
00:13:55,12 --> 00:13:59,17
and they need to have a social feeling
that, "Fundamentally, I matter."

274
00:13:59,25 --> 00:14:02,59
[narrator] If you can't give money,
you can donate your time,

275
00:14:03,05 --> 00:14:04,09
or blood,

276
00:14:04,51 --> 00:14:05,38
or skills.

277
00:14:06,92 --> 00:14:08,93
See what other people
in your neighborhood...

278
00:14:09,01 --> 00:14:10,34
How you can help them.

279
00:14:10,43 --> 00:14:12,51
Like, see how you can help people
in that community.

280
00:14:12,60 --> 00:14:15,14
Don't be afraid of your neighbors
in this time of need.

281
00:14:15,22 --> 00:14:18,52
Like, I think everybody, kind of,
needs to, like, band together

282
00:14:18,98 --> 00:14:20,69
and look out for each other.

283
00:14:20,98 --> 00:14:23,98
At the beginning of March,
I had like, maybe,

284
00:14:24,07 --> 00:14:27,57
250 Instagram followers,
and I mostly posted about dogs.

285
00:14:27,65 --> 00:14:31,66
[narrator] But when Fiona got sick,
she started posting about that instead.

286
00:14:31,74 --> 00:14:34,37
When I started getting, like,
this huge influx of followers

287
00:14:34,45 --> 00:14:37,33
and people DM-ing me
asking about my symptoms

288
00:14:37,41 --> 00:14:39,25
and sharing their own experiences,

289
00:14:39,33 --> 00:14:42,04
I decided to start a support group.

290
00:14:42,54 --> 00:14:43,96
And they're from all over the world

291
00:14:44,04 --> 00:14:46,17
and they're in all different stages
in the virus.

292
00:14:46,55 --> 00:14:48,34
And because people are
in different time zones,

293
00:14:48,42 --> 00:14:49,80
you know, it makes it possible

294
00:14:49,88 --> 00:14:53,18
for someone who wakes up in the middle
of the night to always have a friend.

295
00:14:55,26 --> 00:14:59,31
We're wired for connection.
That's who we are. That's our nature.

296
00:14:59,39 --> 00:15:02,52
Our brain is there
to be involved with other people.

297
00:15:02,61 --> 00:15:05,15
[narrator]
Through millions of years of evolution,

298
00:15:05,23 --> 00:15:07,23
we've learned that facing threats alone

299
00:15:07,32 --> 00:15:10,28
was more dangerous than if you had
the backing of a group.

300
00:15:10,36 --> 00:15:13,70
Just like fear is adaptive, so is empathy.

301
00:15:13,78 --> 00:15:16,87
We find ourselves increasingly
in a situation

302
00:15:16,95 --> 00:15:19,46
in which we're trying to, I think,

303
00:15:19,54 --> 00:15:24,29
create, cultivate, imagine different forms
of solidarity and connection.

304
00:15:24,67 --> 00:15:25,96
-Hi!
-Hi!

305
00:15:26,05 --> 00:15:27,17
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

306
00:15:27,67 --> 00:15:32,89
I think that 7:00 p.m. cheer
is another manifestation of that.

307
00:15:32,97 --> 00:15:34,14
[cheering, pots clanging]

308
00:15:34,22 --> 00:15:36,60
[Kathryn] It may seem silly
that people go outside

309
00:15:36,68 --> 00:15:39,77
and continue to cheer
for essential workers.

310
00:15:39,85 --> 00:15:42,56
But that is just mind-blowing to me.

311
00:15:42,65 --> 00:15:43,60
[horn honking]

312
00:15:43,69 --> 00:15:46,57
Someone posted in the group
this just beautiful message

313
00:15:46,65 --> 00:15:48,32
about how she had realized that...

314
00:15:49,19 --> 00:15:53,03
"My body and I, like,
we fought for our lives and we won.

315
00:15:53,66 --> 00:15:56,99
So I really shouldn't
be pushing myself at all.

316
00:15:57,08 --> 00:16:01,29
All I can do is, like, witness
the next incredible phase of this thing,

317
00:16:01,54 --> 00:16:03,62
which is my body's healing process.

318
00:16:04,00 --> 00:16:06,71
My body knows what to do
'cause it got me this far.

319
00:16:06,79 --> 00:16:10,09
All I can do right now
is kind of let it take the lead."

320
00:16:10,92 --> 00:16:14,01
I swear, I just started sobbing
when I read those words

321
00:16:14,09 --> 00:16:16,64
because it resonated so much with me.

322
00:16:18,22 --> 00:16:20,02
[narrator] Going through this together

323
00:16:20,10 --> 00:16:22,73
may make for a more compassionate world
on the other side.

324
00:16:24,48 --> 00:16:26,94
After the SARS epidemic in 2003,

325
00:16:27,02 --> 00:16:29,40
researchers surveyed residents
of Hong Kong,

326
00:16:29,48 --> 00:16:31,61
one of the cities that had been
hardest hit.

327
00:16:32,24 --> 00:16:33,74
Almost two-thirds of them said

328
00:16:33,82 --> 00:16:37,12
they cared more about their family's
feelings than they did before,

329
00:16:37,53 --> 00:16:39,16
and around the same number said

330
00:16:39,24 --> 00:16:41,95
they paid more attention
to their mental health.

331
00:16:42,58 --> 00:16:46,46
There isn't really a line that you need
to cross to go get help. 

332
00:16:46,54 --> 00:16:49,00
If you feel like, "You know what?
I'm having trouble functioning

333
00:16:49,09 --> 00:16:50,84
in the way that I normally function,"

334
00:16:50,92 --> 00:16:51,92
go get help.

335
00:16:52,01 --> 00:16:54,63
Therapists can give you tools

336
00:16:54,72 --> 00:16:57,76
to help you cope with stresses,
whatever they are.

337
00:16:58,68 --> 00:17:01,60
[narrator] Coping is not
one-size-fits-all.

338
00:17:02,31 --> 00:17:04,39
[in Hindi] We work on our garden
every evening.

339
00:17:06,31 --> 00:17:08,36
[narrator] It's about figuring out
what works for you.

340
00:17:08,44 --> 00:17:12,69
I've been going through my DIY hitlist
I've had for too long,

341
00:17:12,78 --> 00:17:14,70
doing all the jobs that I meant to do.

342
00:17:14,78 --> 00:17:15,99
I made my bed every morning.

343
00:17:16,07 --> 00:17:17,82
You can see right here.

344
00:17:17,91 --> 00:17:19,03
See, it's made today.

345
00:17:19,12 --> 00:17:22,41
Really get dressed and kind of
put myself together in the morning.

346
00:17:22,49 --> 00:17:24,46
I have little goals every day,

347
00:17:24,54 --> 00:17:27,46
to get on the treadmill,
to walk around the apartment.

348
00:17:27,96 --> 00:17:32,46
And if I keep that schedule,
it helps me get through each day.

349
00:17:32,55 --> 00:17:36,30
[Aman] Organize my Lego collection.
Build some Lego.

350
00:17:36,38 --> 00:17:40,05
[in Brazilian Portuguese] I really enjoyed
making this mask and drawing again.

351
00:17:40,85 --> 00:17:44,98
I have perfected the risotto.

352
00:17:45,06 --> 00:17:47,44
Exercise is a great stress reliever
for me,

353
00:17:47,52 --> 00:17:51,57
so going for runs,
or just long walks if I'm exhausted.

354
00:17:52,15 --> 00:17:55,69
I never want to lose the gratitude,
um, that I had

355
00:17:55,78 --> 00:17:59,20
on that day that I got released
from the hospital and that I walked...

356
00:18:00,32 --> 00:18:03,12
back down my block
and saw my house again.

357
00:18:03,58 --> 00:18:04,83
Sorry. [sniffles]

358
00:18:04,91 --> 00:18:10,33
My family lives in Italy, a lot of them,
and we've been doing a lot of group Zooms,

359
00:18:10,42 --> 00:18:12,46
and we've been singing over them.

360
00:18:12,92 --> 00:18:17,17
That's been, like,
such a source of relief for everyone.

361
00:18:17,26 --> 00:18:19,13
[all singing in Italian]

362
00:18:19,22 --> 00:18:20,34
[Jess laughing]

363
00:18:20,43 --> 00:18:23,68
[narrator] Which may actually be
particularly soothing.

364
00:18:23,76 --> 00:18:28,56
There are a lot of different things
about music that reduce stress.

365
00:18:28,64 --> 00:18:30,19
One of them is group singing.

366
00:18:30,27 --> 00:18:32,52
[people singing in Italian]

367
00:18:34,48 --> 00:18:36,53
[Levitin] We don't know exactly
what's going on,

368
00:18:36,61 --> 00:18:39,61
but there's some early evidence
that when we sing together,

369
00:18:39,70 --> 00:18:43,41
our brain waves synchronize
with the other people we're singing with,

370
00:18:43,74 --> 00:18:47,62
oxytocin is released,
which helps us to feel bonded to them,

371
00:18:48,12 --> 00:18:52,58
and we've seen the stress hormone levels
drop when people sing together.

372
00:18:53,13 --> 00:18:54,59
[all singing]

373
00:18:54,96 --> 00:18:58,67
That's how we're wired.
What do you do when you have a baby?

374
00:18:58,76 --> 00:18:59,84
[music playing on speaker]

375
00:18:59,93 --> 00:19:03,05
You sing together, you rock together.
That's our nature.

376
00:19:03,14 --> 00:19:04,51
[man singing]

377
00:19:04,64 --> 00:19:07,10
[van der Kolk] That's how we are formed,
that's how we are made.

378
00:19:10,48 --> 00:19:12,69
[narrator] Stress is there
to help us survive.

379
00:19:12,77 --> 00:19:13,94
[cheers, applause]

380
00:19:14,02 --> 00:19:16,44
[narrator] Coping is to help us live.

381
00:19:17,61 --> 00:19:21,07
So if it gets overwhelming,
just remember...

382
00:19:22,07 --> 00:19:23,87
-breathe in...
-[deep inhale]

383
00:19:23,95 --> 00:19:25,37
-...breathe out.
-[exhale]

384
00:19:25,49 --> 00:19:27,49
