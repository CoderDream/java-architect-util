00:00:06,84 --> 00:00:08,00
-[doctor] Hi.
-Hi.

2
00:00:09,21 --> 00:00:11,59
[narrator] You're witnessing
an historic moment.

3
00:00:12,01 --> 00:00:16,72
Right now, there's a worldwide hunt
for ways to fight this coronavirus.

4
00:00:20,64 --> 00:00:22,43
Scientists are trying everything,

5
00:00:22,52 --> 00:00:25,10
from existing medicines to new therapies.

6
00:00:25,19 --> 00:00:27,81
But the most likely way
we'll end this pandemic

7
00:00:28,31 --> 00:00:29,52
is a vaccine.

8
00:00:31,19 --> 00:00:33,11
On March 16th, 2020,

9
00:00:33,19 --> 00:00:34,99
the first one was tested.

10
00:00:35,07 --> 00:00:36,24
I'm Jennifer Haller,

11
00:00:36,32 --> 00:00:40,87
and I was the first person to receive
an experimental COVID-19 vaccine.

12
00:00:41,62 --> 00:00:44,54
[narrator] We've made other test vaccines
pretty quickly.

13
00:00:44,62 --> 00:00:46,75
One for SARS took 20 months,

14
00:00:46,83 --> 00:00:49,04
one for Ebola, seven months,

15
00:00:49,13 --> 00:00:51,96
and one for Zika, around six months.

16
00:00:52,05 --> 00:00:54,97
But this vaccine candidate
crushed those records.

17
00:00:55,05 --> 00:00:57,64
It was made in just 65 days.

18
00:00:58,18 --> 00:01:00,60
If it's going to end
this pandemic, though,

19
00:01:00,68 --> 00:01:03,10
it's got a long way still to go.

20
00:01:04,14 --> 00:01:07,56
See, any potential vaccine
has a difficult path ahead,

21
00:01:07,65 --> 00:01:11,23
a long and twisting course
full of challenges and trials.

22
00:01:11,52 --> 00:01:12,57
In the US,

23
00:01:12,65 --> 00:01:15,86
typically it takes a vaccine candidate
a decade or so

24
00:01:15,95 --> 00:01:17,82
to make it from start to finish,

25
00:01:18,16 --> 00:01:21,37
and around 90% fail to complete it.

26
00:01:22,33 --> 00:01:24,54
We don't have that kind of time.

27
00:01:24,62 --> 00:01:26,75
Every day, people are dying,

28
00:01:27,25 --> 00:01:29,92
and the economic losses are mounting.

29
00:01:30,88 --> 00:01:35,67
Experts are hoping a vaccine
can be widely available in 2021.

30
00:01:35,76 --> 00:01:37,01
To pull that off,

31
00:01:37,09 --> 00:01:40,93
it will have to get through every stretch
of this course in record time.

32
00:01:41,01 --> 00:01:42,06
[car engines roaring]

33
00:01:42,14 --> 00:01:44,85
[announcer] This is the supreme test
of man and machine.

34
00:01:44,93 --> 00:01:47,31
But while many are called
to the starting line,

35
00:01:47,39 --> 00:01:50,27
usually less than half
finish the grueling drive.

36
00:01:51,65 --> 00:01:56,07
[narrator] Fortunately, more than 100
vaccine candidates are giving it a shot,

37
00:01:56,32 --> 00:02:00,70
made by scientists all over the world,
from veterans at universities...

38
00:02:00,78 --> 00:02:03,70
We have a dedicated group
of extraordinary scientists

39
00:02:03,79 --> 00:02:06,16
that are in the lab day and night.

40
00:02:06,25 --> 00:02:07,91
[narrator] ...to pharmaceutical giants...

41
00:02:08,00 --> 00:02:11,00
We have the teams to do this,
and everyone is excited.

42
00:02:11,08 --> 00:02:12,71
[narrator] ...using proven techniques...

43
00:02:12,79 --> 00:02:15,21
And, of course,
with the coronavirus vaccine,

44
00:02:15,30 --> 00:02:17,22
we have a particular head start.

45
00:02:17,47 --> 00:02:20,22
[narrator] ...and approaches
that have never been tested before.

46
00:02:20,30 --> 00:02:22,10
Everybody competes with each other,

47
00:02:22,18 --> 00:02:24,76
but eventually,
only the very best survive.

48
00:02:24,85 --> 00:02:29,27
[narrator] But getting a vaccine
is also going to take a lot of money...

49
00:02:29,35 --> 00:02:32,56
Okay, here we are. You know,
we can get money out really fast.

50
00:02:32,65 --> 00:02:34,48
We can do evaluations of these things.

51
00:02:34,57 --> 00:02:36,44
Now we're all trying to step up

52
00:02:36,53 --> 00:02:38,90
and look all over the world
for the best ideas.

53
00:02:39,24 --> 00:02:40,61
[narrator] ...and collaboration.

54
00:02:40,70 --> 00:02:43,24
The entire global scientific community

55
00:02:43,32 --> 00:02:46,66
has come together
in a truly unprecedented way.

56
00:02:46,74 --> 00:02:48,91
[narrator] ...and brave volunteers.

57
00:02:49,08 --> 00:02:52,54
We're all feeling so helpless,
and this was something that I saw

58
00:02:52,63 --> 00:02:56,55
that I could do that could
potentially make a difference.

59
00:02:56,96 --> 00:02:59,17
[narrator] Together,
they're in one of the most

60
00:02:59,26 --> 00:03:01,63
high-stakes scientific races in history.

61
00:03:02,14 --> 00:03:04,68
I compare this to a space race.

62
00:03:04,76 --> 00:03:08,64
We have so many contenders reaching for
something that was previously unknown.

63
00:03:08,73 --> 00:03:09,98
"How do I get to Mars?"

64
00:03:10,06 --> 00:03:11,10
"How do I get to Venus?"

65
00:03:11,19 --> 00:03:13,94
"How do we create
the next COVID-19 vaccine?"

66
00:03:14,02 --> 00:03:16,07
[narrator] And the other big question:

67
00:03:16,15 --> 00:03:18,28
how fast can we do it?

68
00:03:18,61 --> 00:03:19,69
[theme music playing]

69
00:03:19,78 --> 00:03:23,28
Given the fact that we now have the virus
in our hands,

70
00:03:23,36 --> 00:03:25,20
we will develop a vaccine.

71
00:03:25,28 --> 00:03:30,87
[man 1] We can move very fast in ways
that have not been previously achieved.

72
00:03:30,96 --> 00:03:34,71
[man 2] It's only once that vaccine
has been proven to be safe

73
00:03:34,79 --> 00:03:37,46
that it'll be allowed out of confinement.

74
00:03:37,55 --> 00:03:39,84
[man 3] What they needed was a vaccine,

75
00:03:39,92 --> 00:03:42,55
and the fight never stopped
till it was found.

76
00:03:44,84 --> 00:03:48,60
[man 4] There remain other viruses
to be isolated, other vaccines to come,

77
00:03:48,68 --> 00:03:49,68
but they will.

78
00:03:58,02 --> 00:04:01,90
[narrator] This coronavirus,
and all viruses, are so hard to fight,

79
00:04:01,99 --> 00:04:05,07
in part because they're so simple.

80
00:04:05,62 --> 00:04:08,08
They're basically just little vehicles

81
00:04:08,16 --> 00:04:11,41
that carry instructions
on how to make more of themselves.

82
00:04:11,96 --> 00:04:16,13
To reproduce, they smuggle
these instructions into our cells

83
00:04:16,21 --> 00:04:20,46
and force our cellular machinery
to make more and more viruses.

84
00:04:20,55 --> 00:04:23,80
They spread through the body
and hijack more cells,

85
00:04:24,13 --> 00:04:25,93
damaging them in the process,

86
00:04:26,34 --> 00:04:28,10
which makes us feel sick.

87
00:04:29,18 --> 00:04:31,10
But we're not defenseless.

88
00:04:31,72 --> 00:04:32,56
[alarm blares]

89
00:04:32,64 --> 00:04:34,64
-[narrator] Cells in our immune system
-[siren wails]

90
00:04:34,73 --> 00:04:37,73
can find the intruder
and identify a marker,

91
00:04:37,81 --> 00:04:41,11
a distinguishing feature
which we call an antigen.

92
00:04:41,36 --> 00:04:46,49
Then they mobilize to seek out
and destroy anything with that antigen.

93
00:04:47,03 --> 00:04:51,20
Our immune system also produces
little molecules called antibodies

94
00:04:51,29 --> 00:04:55,04
that stick to that antigen,
tagging and subduing the virus.

95
00:04:55,54 --> 00:04:56,96
But from the day we're infected,

96
00:04:57,04 --> 00:05:00,80
it can take almost two weeks
for this response to ramp up,

97
00:05:01,88 --> 00:05:05,26
enough time for this coronavirus
to swarm through the body,

98
00:05:05,80 --> 00:05:07,05
wreaking havoc.

99
00:05:07,97 --> 00:05:11,47
And sometimes our immune system
ramps up too much

100
00:05:11,56 --> 00:05:13,52
and causes even more harm.

101
00:05:13,60 --> 00:05:17,77
In some people,
all this damage becomes overwhelming,

102
00:05:18,31 --> 00:05:19,40
and they die.

103
00:05:19,48 --> 00:05:22,28
In one shift,
I pronounced six people dead.

104
00:05:23,11 --> 00:05:25,36
[narrator] This is where
having a treatment would help.

105
00:05:26,36 --> 00:05:30,58
Some inject antibodies,
those molecules that subdue the virus,

106
00:05:30,66 --> 00:05:33,45
either synthetic antibodies made in a lab,

107
00:05:33,54 --> 00:05:35,83
or from the blood of people
who've recovered.

108
00:05:36,50 --> 00:05:40,08
Others rein in our immune systems
if they're getting out of control.

109
00:05:40,63 --> 00:05:42,88
And some, like Remdesivir,

110
00:05:42,96 --> 00:05:47,01
actually enter our cells
to block the virus from copying itself.

111
00:05:47,09 --> 00:05:51,01
Early results showed it could
potentially make the virus less deadly.

112
00:05:51,55 --> 00:05:54,43
It is a very important proof of concept,

113
00:05:54,52 --> 00:05:59,69
because what it has proven
is that a drug can block this virus.

114
00:06:00,52 --> 00:06:01,90
[narrator] But as of May,

115
00:06:01,98 --> 00:06:05,19
none of these treatments
can stop a person from getting sick,

116
00:06:05,28 --> 00:06:07,65
or spreading this coronavirus to others.

117
00:06:08,20 --> 00:06:09,95
A vaccine would,

118
00:06:10,53 --> 00:06:12,66
and it does it by taking advantage
of something

119
00:06:12,74 --> 00:06:15,83
our bodies have evolved
over millions of years:

120
00:06:15,91 --> 00:06:16,91
memory.

121
00:06:17,62 --> 00:06:21,88
After it deals with a virus,
our immune system remembers the antigens,

122
00:06:22,09 --> 00:06:23,59
sometimes forever,

123
00:06:23,92 --> 00:06:26,05
other times just for a while.

124
00:06:26,71 --> 00:06:30,84
We know our bodies can remember these
other coronaviruses for a couple years.

125
00:06:31,14 --> 00:06:33,22
So if this coronavirus is similar

126
00:06:33,30 --> 00:06:36,56
and it shows up in our bodies again
in that time,

127
00:06:36,64 --> 00:06:40,60
our immune system can ramp up much faster
with overwhelming force,

128
00:06:40,69 --> 00:06:43,31
wiping out the virus
before it can make us sick

129
00:06:43,40 --> 00:06:44,86
or spread to someone else.

130
00:06:45,23 --> 00:06:48,74
This is what it means
to be immune to a virus.

131
00:06:49,15 --> 00:06:50,95
A vaccine makes us immune

132
00:06:51,03 --> 00:06:54,49
by safely showing the body
what a virus looks like,

133
00:06:54,58 --> 00:06:59,00
faking this first infection
to teach your body how to respond,

134
00:06:59,08 --> 00:07:02,58
so when it does encounter the real virus,
it's ready.

135
00:07:03,13 --> 00:07:05,46
No vaccine is 100% effective,

136
00:07:05,55 --> 00:07:09,22
meaning not everyone who receives one
will be perfectly immune,

137
00:07:09,30 --> 00:07:12,89
but vaccines don't need to be perfect
to end epidemics.

138
00:07:13,22 --> 00:07:16,06
Smallpox used to be
a leading cause of death,

139
00:07:16,14 --> 00:07:19,89
and measles killed millions a year,
most of them children.

140
00:07:19,98 --> 00:07:23,81
But thanks to vaccines
that are around 95% effective,

141
00:07:24,02 --> 00:07:25,73
we've wiped out smallpox

142
00:07:25,82 --> 00:07:28,94
and made enormous progress
against measles.

143
00:07:29,40 --> 00:07:32,61
Vaccine makers are hoping to make
a vaccine that effective.

144
00:07:32,70 --> 00:07:38,29
If all we could make was a vaccine that,
let's say, had 50% efficacy,

145
00:07:38,37 --> 00:07:40,83
so it prevented about
half of the infections,

146
00:07:40,91 --> 00:07:43,96
if that translates into stopping
half of the deaths,

147
00:07:44,04 --> 00:07:45,38
that's really good news.

148
00:07:45,46 --> 00:07:46,59
[narrator] The fact is,

149
00:07:46,67 --> 00:07:50,51
vaccines are one of the most
significant inventions in human history.

150
00:07:50,97 --> 00:07:52,72
The world doesn't agree on much,

151
00:07:52,80 --> 00:07:57,39
but more than 90% of all people believe
childhood vaccinations are important,

152
00:07:57,47 --> 00:08:01,10
and that's crucial,
because to wipe out an infectious disease,

153
00:08:01,18 --> 00:08:04,23
you need most people in the world
to be immune.

154
00:08:04,65 --> 00:08:06,44
It's called herd immunity.

155
00:08:06,52 --> 00:08:11,82
The idea is that individuals become immune
either by getting infected and surviving,

156
00:08:11,90 --> 00:08:13,57
or by getting vaccinated.

157
00:08:13,91 --> 00:08:15,82
When enough people are immune,

158
00:08:15,91 --> 00:08:19,29
the virus has trouble spreading,
and slows down.

159
00:08:19,37 --> 00:08:21,83
You know, you are also protecting
by vaccinating yourself

160
00:08:21,91 --> 00:08:25,50
not just yourself, but you are protecting
weak members in the community

161
00:08:25,58 --> 00:08:28,09
who may not be able to get the vaccine.

162
00:08:28,17 --> 00:08:32,13
[narrator] Like newborns, the elderly,
and people with weak immune systems.

163
00:08:32,22 --> 00:08:36,80
So it's both an act of protecting yourself
and it's also an act of altruism.

164
00:08:37,22 --> 00:08:39,47
[narrator] So defeating
an infectious disease

165
00:08:39,56 --> 00:08:41,93
requires the whole world coming together,

166
00:08:42,02 --> 00:08:46,15
and in the COVID-19 race, the world has
come together like never before.

167
00:08:47,44 --> 00:08:50,11
Out of the over 100 candidates
in the race in May,

168
00:08:50,19 --> 00:08:54,65
almost half are in North America,
and 17 are in China.

169
00:08:54,74 --> 00:08:56,78
And they're funded in different ways,

170
00:08:56,86 --> 00:08:58,70
most by private industry.

171
00:08:59,33 --> 00:09:03,33
But the main difference between them
is their vaccine platform,

172
00:09:03,41 --> 00:09:06,25
how they're showing the body
what the virus looks like.

173
00:09:07,33 --> 00:09:11,25
Some vaccines inject a weakened version
of the virus into the body.

174
00:09:11,34 --> 00:09:15,55
It can't reproduce or do damage
but it still has that antigen,

175
00:09:15,63 --> 00:09:18,93
so our immune system can learn
what to watch out for.

176
00:09:19,30 --> 00:09:21,64
That's how we vaccinate against polio,

177
00:09:21,72 --> 00:09:23,68
the measles, mumps, and rubella,

178
00:09:23,77 --> 00:09:25,56
chicken pox, rotavirus,

179
00:09:25,64 --> 00:09:27,14
and for the flu.

180
00:09:27,23 --> 00:09:30,73
This is by far
our most tried-and-true method,

181
00:09:30,82 --> 00:09:32,90
but it's a slow way to do it.

182
00:09:32,98 --> 00:09:37,11
We have to grow the virus for months
in other living cells, like chicken eggs,

183
00:09:37,20 --> 00:09:39,37
a method we've been using for decades.

184
00:09:39,78 --> 00:09:42,70
We'll call these
the first-generation vaccines,

185
00:09:42,79 --> 00:09:45,83
and there are nine in the race
as of early May.

186
00:09:46,71 --> 00:09:49,04
Other scientists are trying
a newer approach.

187
00:09:49,13 --> 00:09:51,04
Instead of the whole coronavirus,

188
00:09:51,13 --> 00:09:53,50
they're giving the body just an antigen,

189
00:09:53,59 --> 00:09:56,38
a piece they think will activate
the immune response.

190
00:09:56,63 --> 00:10:00,72
Those antigens also need to be grown,
sometimes in yeast cells,

191
00:10:00,80 --> 00:10:02,89
or attached to another harmless virus.

192
00:10:03,39 --> 00:10:06,39
This is how the vaccine
for hepatitis B works,

193
00:10:06,48 --> 00:10:09,27
and for whooping cough, and meningitis B.

194
00:10:09,90 --> 00:10:12,94
We'll call these
second-generation vaccines,

195
00:10:13,02 --> 00:10:17,99
and they're the most popular kind
in the COVID-19 race, with 72 candidates.

196
00:10:19,11 --> 00:10:21,41
Finally, there's a brand new
type of vaccine

197
00:10:21,49 --> 00:10:24,49
that doesn't use any part
of the actual virus at all.

198
00:10:24,91 --> 00:10:28,46
Instead, it just gives our bodies
the virus's instructions,

199
00:10:28,54 --> 00:10:32,92
tiny pieces of genetic code that tell
our cells to produce the antigens,

200
00:10:33,00 --> 00:10:35,13
which then activate the immune response.

201
00:10:35,63 --> 00:10:40,18
No vaccine using this approach has
ever been approved for use in humans.

202
00:10:40,26 --> 00:10:43,22
We'll call these
the third-generation vaccines,

203
00:10:43,30 --> 00:10:46,06
and there are 27 in the race.

204
00:10:46,14 --> 00:10:49,19
Because they don't involve
growing any part of any virus,

205
00:10:49,27 --> 00:10:51,60
they can be made extremely fast.

206
00:10:52,15 --> 00:10:55,98
This record-breaking vaccine
was a third-generation candidate

207
00:10:56,07 --> 00:10:58,15
from a US company called Moderna.

208
00:10:58,78 --> 00:11:01,45
But making a vaccine candidate
isn't the hard part.

209
00:11:01,86 --> 00:11:03,53
This next phase is.

210
00:11:03,87 --> 00:11:04,99
Clinical trials.

211
00:11:05,08 --> 00:11:06,20
[engines rev]

212
00:11:06,29 --> 00:11:07,95
[announcer] And they're up to speed.

213
00:11:09,41 --> 00:11:11,87
[narrator] Traditionally,
there are three phases.

214
00:11:12,96 --> 00:11:16,30
First, teams give their vaccines
to a small group of people,

215
00:11:16,38 --> 00:11:20,13
wait a few months, and see if any of them
report dangerous side effects.

216
00:11:20,84 --> 00:11:22,09
If everything looks good,

217
00:11:22,18 --> 00:11:24,89
the vaccine moves on and is given
to a couple hundred people,

218
00:11:24,97 --> 00:11:27,52
again, to see if there are
any dangerous side effects,

219
00:11:27,60 --> 00:11:30,81
but also to see if
people's immune systems ramp up.

220
00:11:30,89 --> 00:11:33,69
That involves more waiting,
usually months.

221
00:11:34,61 --> 00:11:37,27
Then the candidate moves on
to the third test,

222
00:11:37,36 --> 00:11:40,53
where thousands are vaccinated
to triple-check for side effects

223
00:11:40,61 --> 00:11:42,24
and see how well it works.

224
00:11:42,32 --> 00:11:45,28
That's another few months
or years of waiting.

225
00:11:46,41 --> 00:11:47,99
This isn't like testing a drug

226
00:11:48,08 --> 00:11:50,25
where you give it to people
with a disease

227
00:11:50,62 --> 00:11:52,21
and see if it makes them better.

228
00:11:52,83 --> 00:11:55,54
You're giving it to people
who don't have a disease,

229
00:11:56,13 --> 00:12:00,01
and then checking later to see
if they still don't have the disease.

230
00:12:00,97 --> 00:12:04,68
In normal times, this whole process
can take around four years,

231
00:12:04,76 --> 00:12:06,64
testing around 5,000 people.

232
00:12:07,14 --> 00:12:11,10
But vaccine developers are hoping
to do some of this testing simultaneously,

233
00:12:11,52 --> 00:12:15,69
still testing the same number of people,
but all in around 18 months.

234
00:12:16,23 --> 00:12:18,98
It's how some candidates
are moving so quickly.

235
00:12:19,07 --> 00:12:22,78
The FDA has cleared the Moderna vaccine
for phase two of its trial.

236
00:12:22,86 --> 00:12:24,53
[reporter 1]
Moderna moving at record speed.

237
00:12:24,61 --> 00:12:26,95
China's already given approval
for another clinical trial.

238
00:12:27,03 --> 00:12:28,20
It's now at the second phase.

239
00:12:28,28 --> 00:12:31,37
The vaccine, uh, that is
most promising right now

240
00:12:31,45 --> 00:12:33,71
is the one from Oxford University.

241
00:12:33,79 --> 00:12:37,29
-That has merged phase one and phase two.
-...which is speedy.

242
00:12:38,54 --> 00:12:42,21
[narrator] This stage of the race can't go
any faster, for good reason.

243
00:12:42,51 --> 00:12:44,76
[Kirchhelle] Without running through
all of these trials,

244
00:12:44,84 --> 00:12:46,55
it would be absolutely unethical

245
00:12:46,64 --> 00:12:50,81
to roll out a vaccine potentially
to the entire global population,

246
00:12:51,60 --> 00:12:53,81
because you could do some real harm there.

247
00:12:54,94 --> 00:12:57,48
[news reel announcer] Our men today
are safe against yellow fever.

248
00:12:57,56 --> 00:13:01,94
A few drops of vaccine will give them
dependable and lasting immunity.

249
00:13:02,69 --> 00:13:04,03
[narrator] During World War II,

250
00:13:04,11 --> 00:13:06,91
Allied soldiers were vaccinated
for yellow fever.

251
00:13:07,49 --> 00:13:11,41
Thousands developed jaundice
and hepatitis, and some died.

252
00:13:11,74 --> 00:13:13,16
That should never have happened.

253
00:13:13,25 --> 00:13:15,83
If the vaccine makers
had done their research,

254
00:13:15,92 --> 00:13:20,00
they would have discovered reports
of these side effects dating back to 1885.

255
00:13:21,00 --> 00:13:22,71
Then in the 1950s,

256
00:13:22,80 --> 00:13:27,01
some poorly made vaccines infected
40,000 people with polio,

257
00:13:27,09 --> 00:13:28,89
and killed around 200.

258
00:13:29,26 --> 00:13:30,89
Known as "the Cutter incident,"

259
00:13:30,97 --> 00:13:35,14
it led the US government to tighten
requirements for vaccine manufacturers.

260
00:13:35,68 --> 00:13:41,82
Nothing is licensed without undergoing
extremely stringent safety considerations.

261
00:13:41,90 --> 00:13:45,28
And even after it's licensed,
the vaccine continues to be monitored.

262
00:13:45,36 --> 00:13:47,70
[narrator] Today,
according to the US government,

263
00:13:47,78 --> 00:13:50,74
for every million doses of vaccine
that are distributed,

264
00:13:50,83 --> 00:13:54,37
only one person is compensated
for serious side effects.

265
00:13:54,91 --> 00:14:00,08
Vaccines need to pass an extra-high bar
because they're given to healthy people.

266
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:02,67
[Hatchett] What we can't do
is take shortcuts

267
00:14:02,75 --> 00:14:04,80
where safety and effectiveness
are concerned.

268
00:14:04,88 --> 00:14:07,09
I think there are ways
to streamline some things

269
00:14:07,17 --> 00:14:08,51
and do more things in parallel,

270
00:14:08,59 --> 00:14:10,05
but it's going to be tough,

271
00:14:10,14 --> 00:14:13,06
and it's going to be
a carefully orchestrated dance.

272
00:14:13,14 --> 00:14:15,72
Rather than running everything in series

273
00:14:15,81 --> 00:14:19,14
and having just one person doing
each of these steps along the way,

274
00:14:19,23 --> 00:14:21,11
whole teams of people have been put there

275
00:14:21,19 --> 00:14:25,73
to ensure that we still maintain
the same quality and safety.

276
00:14:26,32 --> 00:14:28,74
[narrator] But some teams
did have a head start here,

277
00:14:28,82 --> 00:14:31,24
because this isn't the first coronavirus,

278
00:14:31,32 --> 00:14:35,12
or the first coronavirus
to inspire a race for a vaccine.

279
00:14:36,00 --> 00:14:37,75
[reporter 2] The impact of SARS.

280
00:14:38,16 --> 00:14:41,92
[reporter 3] The SARS disease
has spread across the world.

281
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:43,92
[reporter 4] The battle against
an outbreak

282
00:14:44,00 --> 00:14:48,01
of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome,
or MERS, continues in South Korea.

283
00:14:48,09 --> 00:14:51,14
[narrator] When SARS and MERS viruses
caused outbreaks,

284
00:14:51,22 --> 00:14:54,01
many scientists got to work on vaccines,

285
00:14:54,10 --> 00:14:56,60
including a team at Oxford University.

286
00:14:56,68 --> 00:15:00,44
We've learnt a lot about coronaviruses
and their biology,

287
00:15:00,52 --> 00:15:02,81
actually, because of
the last two big outbreaks.

288
00:15:03,27 --> 00:15:07,32
[narrator] In 2018, Oxford University
got a promising MERS candidate

289
00:15:07,40 --> 00:15:08,61
into human trials,

290
00:15:08,69 --> 00:15:12,07
hoping to stop the next outbreak
of this rare coronavirus.

291
00:15:12,16 --> 00:15:16,20
But then a year later,
this latest coronavirus broke out.

292
00:15:16,29 --> 00:15:17,58
Because it was similar,

293
00:15:17,66 --> 00:15:22,58
the team easily adapted their MERS vaccine
into a COVID-19 one.

294
00:15:22,67 --> 00:15:26,42
And so that has really been
a major shortcut that we've had,

295
00:15:26,50 --> 00:15:29,05
by not having to go back
to the drawing board and start again.

296
00:15:29,13 --> 00:15:31,51
[narrator] They sped through
the first phase of trials,

297
00:15:31,59 --> 00:15:34,68
putting them on track to begin
the next phases in the summer.

298
00:15:34,76 --> 00:15:37,60
We don't know for certain that
that will all go to plan,

299
00:15:37,68 --> 00:15:40,02
but if it does,
then it's certainly possible

300
00:15:40,10 --> 00:15:42,52
that there could be millions of doses
available in the autumn.

301
00:15:43,02 --> 00:15:46,02
[narrator] Unfortunately,
Oxford's story is uncommon.

302
00:15:46,40 --> 00:15:51,65
Peter Hotez also made a promising
coronavirus vaccine for SARS years ago.

303
00:15:51,74 --> 00:15:55,20
It was all going well,
and then the grant ended.

304
00:15:55,28 --> 00:15:57,03
And we thought,
"Well, we've gone this far.

305
00:15:57,12 --> 00:16:00,41
We'll just get funding to move it
into clinical trials."

306
00:16:00,50 --> 00:16:01,96
And unfortunately, we couldn't.

307
00:16:02,04 --> 00:16:04,88
[narrator] This happened to so many
promising vaccines

308
00:16:04,96 --> 00:16:08,46
that this stage is often called
"the Vaccine Valley of Death."

309
00:16:08,92 --> 00:16:10,46
Of these vaccine candidates

310
00:16:10,55 --> 00:16:12,80
that scientists race to make
in record time,

311
00:16:12,88 --> 00:16:15,05
only Ebola reached the finish line.

312
00:16:15,14 --> 00:16:18,68
Because when these outbreaks ended,
so did the funding.

313
00:16:18,76 --> 00:16:22,23
After every catastrophic pandemic
or epidemic,

314
00:16:22,31 --> 00:16:24,81
I say, "Maybe this is the one
that moves the needle

315
00:16:24,90 --> 00:16:27,40
and gets public funding in place."

316
00:16:27,48 --> 00:16:29,82
And I said that after SARS in 2003,

317
00:16:29,90 --> 00:16:33,24
I said it after H1N1 in 2009,

318
00:16:33,32 --> 00:16:35,53
I said it after MERS in 2012,

319
00:16:35,61 --> 00:16:37,66
I said it after Ebola in 2014,

320
00:16:37,74 --> 00:16:39,95
after Zika in 2016, and I'll say it again.

321
00:16:40,49 --> 00:16:44,08
[narrator] Peter's COVID-19 candidate
is based on his SARS candidate.

322
00:16:44,16 --> 00:16:46,58
But if he had been able
to test it back then...

323
00:16:47,04 --> 00:16:49,42
We would have had the safety testing
potentially finished,

324
00:16:49,50 --> 00:16:51,38
and that's not insignificant, right?

325
00:16:51,46 --> 00:16:55,68
So that's too bad
that we lost that opportunity.

326
00:16:56,26 --> 00:16:57,80
[narrator] In 2017,

327
00:16:57,89 --> 00:17:00,18
a group of people funded in part
by the Gates Foundation

328
00:17:00,26 --> 00:17:02,35
came together to fix this.

329
00:17:02,43 --> 00:17:06,02
Well, unfortunately, even though
there's a substantial risk

330
00:17:06,10 --> 00:17:07,90
of various types of epidemics,

331
00:17:07,98 --> 00:17:12,19
there's not a natural incentive for people
to build products that anticipate that.

332
00:17:12,28 --> 00:17:16,24
You've got to bring governments
and foundations together

333
00:17:16,32 --> 00:17:18,41
to create the right incentive structure.

334
00:17:18,49 --> 00:17:20,58
[narrator] They call themselves CEPI,

335
00:17:20,66 --> 00:17:23,50
The Coalition for Epidemic
Preparedness Innovations.

336
00:17:23,91 --> 00:17:25,58
[Hatchett] What CEPI is,

337
00:17:25,66 --> 00:17:28,83
is it aggregates funding
and creates a pool of funds

338
00:17:28,92 --> 00:17:31,05
to support vaccine development.

339
00:17:31,13 --> 00:17:32,71
So we can play fair broker

340
00:17:32,80 --> 00:17:36,18
and take those billions that are available
for tools for the world

341
00:17:36,26 --> 00:17:38,09
and make sure they go to the right place.

342
00:17:38,18 --> 00:17:42,26
[narrator] As of early May, CEPI is behind
nine COVID-19 candidates,

343
00:17:42,35 --> 00:17:44,31
including two of the early front-runners:

344
00:17:44,39 --> 00:17:47,02
Oxford's new candidate, and Moderna's.

345
00:17:47,10 --> 00:17:49,35
And it's the success
of those two candidates,

346
00:17:49,44 --> 00:17:50,61
and one from China,

347
00:17:50,69 --> 00:17:55,11
that give experts hope that we can have
a vaccine approved in 18 months,

348
00:17:55,19 --> 00:17:57,45
but that isn't the end of the race.

349
00:17:57,53 --> 00:17:58,86
Not even close.

350
00:17:59,53 --> 00:18:00,70
[car engines roaring]

351
00:18:00,78 --> 00:18:02,53
[announcer] And around they go once more,

352
00:18:02,62 --> 00:18:05,70
burning tires down to the fabric
as they pour on the coal.

353
00:18:06,91 --> 00:18:10,92
[narrator] Remember, to end this pandemic,
we need to reach herd immunity.

354
00:18:11,46 --> 00:18:14,05
And for this coronavirus, experts estimate

355
00:18:14,13 --> 00:18:18,13
that means at least 60% of the world
needs to become immune.

356
00:18:18,22 --> 00:18:22,14
That's 60% of almost eight billion people.

357
00:18:22,22 --> 00:18:23,89
[interviewer] Billions of vaccines
need to be made?

358
00:18:23,97 --> 00:18:24,97
That's correct.

359
00:18:25,06 --> 00:18:29,77
We've never produced a billion doses
of a vaccine in the history of the world.

360
00:18:29,85 --> 00:18:33,36
[Gates] You're in a new regime
when you talk about billions of a vaccine.

361
00:18:33,44 --> 00:18:35,40
We don't make billions of any vaccine.

362
00:18:35,48 --> 00:18:36,65
We make hundreds of millions,

363
00:18:36,74 --> 00:18:40,11
but those we've had decades to work on.
And even the bottles,

364
00:18:40,74 --> 00:18:43,16
that's a special,
pharmaceutical-grade glass,

365
00:18:43,24 --> 00:18:45,04
the world doesn't have enough of that.

366
00:18:45,12 --> 00:18:46,37
[narrator] Just to start with,

367
00:18:46,45 --> 00:18:49,54
to make a billion doses,
you need a lot of factories.

368
00:18:49,62 --> 00:18:53,42
But each type of vaccine requires
a different kind of factory,

369
00:18:53,50 --> 00:18:57,17
and ramping up production
in enough factories can take years.

370
00:18:57,26 --> 00:18:59,26
But a lot of the giants have a shortcut.

371
00:18:59,34 --> 00:19:02,09
They have the factories
to start production now.

372
00:19:02,18 --> 00:19:04,76
We have one big plant
which is fully operational.

373
00:19:04,85 --> 00:19:08,85
So that can spit out 300 million vaccines.

374
00:19:08,93 --> 00:19:13,73
Now we are very quickly
setting up additional plants in the world.

375
00:19:14,27 --> 00:19:18,28
[narrator] But the newer types of vaccines
don't have many, or any, factories yet,

376
00:19:18,57 --> 00:19:21,53
so some are placing bets
on candidates now,

377
00:19:21,61 --> 00:19:25,20
building factories for the ones
they think might survive trials.

378
00:19:25,28 --> 00:19:30,29
After all, those investments are,
at most, billions to save trillions.

379
00:19:30,37 --> 00:19:33,13
[narrator] And even if we can
make that many doses,

380
00:19:33,21 --> 00:19:36,63
we'll still need to get the vaccine
to people all over the world,

381
00:19:36,71 --> 00:19:39,26
and that's when politics
can get in the way.

382
00:19:40,67 --> 00:19:43,01
[Andrew Cuthbertson] We have
a specific vaccine that we believe

383
00:19:43,09 --> 00:19:48,68
will be able to protect millions of people
against this new H1N1 flu.

384
00:19:48,77 --> 00:19:51,85
[narrator]
During the swine flu epidemic in 2009,

385
00:19:51,94 --> 00:19:55,27
an Australian company was
among the first to make a vaccine,

386
00:19:55,36 --> 00:19:58,44
and the government made
them sell to Australians first.

387
00:19:59,11 --> 00:20:01,07
Canada made a similar move.

388
00:20:01,74 --> 00:20:04,91
And while the US promised
to donate some of its supply,

389
00:20:04,99 --> 00:20:07,37
they waited until the epidemic was over.

390
00:20:08,04 --> 00:20:11,00
So it matters where a vaccine is made.

391
00:20:11,46 --> 00:20:14,17
Vaccine nationalism. That is real.

392
00:20:14,25 --> 00:20:17,17
There are early signs that people
are trying to buy by the biotech companies

393
00:20:17,25 --> 00:20:18,71
that have lead contenders.

394
00:20:18,80 --> 00:20:20,92
There's a long tradition
of narrowly putting

395
00:20:21,01 --> 00:20:22,67
national interest above others,

396
00:20:22,76 --> 00:20:25,97
and that's obviously often correlated
with people who have the money.

397
00:20:26,05 --> 00:20:27,93
[narrator] World leaders
have come together

398
00:20:28,01 --> 00:20:29,56
and called for cooperation.

399
00:20:29,64 --> 00:20:33,69
[in German] Science is never national.
Science serves mankind.

400
00:20:33,85 --> 00:20:37,69
[in English] The commitment to ensuring
equal access is the key.

401
00:20:37,77 --> 00:20:40,69
Victory against this virus
cannot be declared

402
00:20:40,78 --> 00:20:44,40
before effective vaccines and therapeutics
are made available

403
00:20:44,49 --> 00:20:46,49
to all in need around the world.

404
00:20:47,12 --> 00:20:50,49
[narrator] But as of May,
the US hasn't been one of them.

405
00:20:52,62 --> 00:20:56,42
Who can get a vaccine
will also depend on its price.

406
00:20:56,50 --> 00:20:58,88
How much should it cost?
Should rich countries pay more?

407
00:20:58,96 --> 00:21:00,96
Should, you know,
poorer countries pay less?

408
00:21:01,05 --> 00:21:05,09
And also, if this vaccine is developed
by a major pharmaceutical company,

409
00:21:05,18 --> 00:21:08,18
how much money is this company
allowed to make off this vaccine?

410
00:21:09,01 --> 00:21:12,43
[narrator] Remember, most of these
vaccines are funded privately,

411
00:21:12,52 --> 00:21:15,64
and based on how some
vaccine makers' stocks have risen,

412
00:21:15,73 --> 00:21:18,86
some people clearly see
a potential windfall ahead.

413
00:21:19,36 --> 00:21:22,44
But so far, some companies
like Johnson & Johnson

414
00:21:22,53 --> 00:21:25,20
have promised to make
their vaccine affordable,

415
00:21:25,28 --> 00:21:27,16
as little as $10 a dose.

416
00:21:27,61 --> 00:21:33,66
And that's critical, because a vaccine can
only win if it gets to billions of people,

417
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:36,00
including those who can't afford it.

418
00:21:36,08 --> 00:21:38,04
So to vaccinate enough of the world,

419
00:21:38,13 --> 00:21:40,96
we'll actually need more than one winner.

420
00:21:42,75 --> 00:21:44,88
-[engines roaring]
-[crowd cheering]

421
00:21:45,47 --> 00:21:48,30
[narrator] This race isn't really
between the candidates.

422
00:21:48,39 --> 00:21:51,51
It's between humanity and this virus,

423
00:21:51,60 --> 00:21:55,31
that simple little vehicle
that's paralyzed economies

424
00:21:55,39 --> 00:21:59,02
and ended hundreds of thousands
of lives around the world.

425
00:21:59,44 --> 00:22:02,86
We can only beat it by doing
what we've never done before:

426
00:22:03,23 --> 00:22:06,49
making a vaccine for everyone
in record time.
