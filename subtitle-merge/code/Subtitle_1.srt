00:01:21,88 --> 00:01:25,51
Good morning. And welcome to WWDC.

3
00:01:21,88 --> 00:01:25,51
Good morning. And welcome to WWDC.

4
00:01:25,58 --> 00:01:31,62
WWDC is an incredibly important event
to Apple, our developers and our users.

5
00:01:25,58 --> 00:01:31,62
WWDC is an incredibly important event
to Apple, our developers and our users.

6
00:01:32,02 --> 00:01:35,32
It's here that we bring
some of our biggest innovations to life.

7
00:01:35,82 --> 00:01:37,46
And we have not stopped innovating,

8
00:01:35,82 --> 00:01:37,46
And we have not stopped innovating,

9
00:01:37,53 --> 00:01:40,86
doing the work that will enrich
people's lives for years to come.

10
00:01:41,23 --> 00:01:44,73
Because we're all looking forward
to a more hopeful tomorrow.

11
00:01:41,23 --> 00:01:44,73
Because we're all looking forward
to a more hopeful tomorrow.

12
00:01:45,17 --> 00:01:49,20
That's why we believe it's so important
to have WWDC this year.

13
00:01:45,17 --> 00:01:49,20
That's why we believe it's so important
to have WWDC this year.

14
00:01:49,64 --> 00:01:52,81
And while it cannot possibly
feel the same in here without you,

15
00:01:52,88 --> 00:01:56,45
I can assure you
that we have a great show ahead of us.

16
00:01:52,88 --> 00:01:56,45
I can assure you
that we have a great show ahead of us.

17
00:01:57,15 --> 00:01:59,82
This year we're delivering the conference
in a whole new way

18
00:01:59,88 --> 00:02:03,12
to all of you around the world,
directly to your home.

19
00:01:59,88 --> 00:02:03,12
to all of you around the world,
directly to your home.

20
00:02:03,19 --> 00:02:06,49
And we want to welcome you
to our home here at Apple Park.

21
00:02:03,19 --> 00:02:06,49
And we want to welcome you
to our home here at Apple Park.

22
00:02:07,36 --> 00:02:09,69
I'd like to first talk to you
about two big things

23
00:02:09,76 --> 00:02:11,76
that are happening in the world right now.

24
00:02:12,66 --> 00:02:17,93
To start, I want to address the topic
of racism, inequality and injustice

25
00:02:18,37 --> 00:02:21,74
and to recognize the pain being felt
throughout our nation,

26
00:02:22,07 --> 00:02:24,51
especially in
our Black and Brown communities,

27
00:02:22,07 --> 00:02:24,51
especially in
our Black and Brown communities,

28
00:02:24,57 --> 00:02:27,08
after the senseless killing
of George Floyd.

29
00:02:27,94 --> 00:02:31,21
And while the events of this past month
are sadly not new,

30
00:02:27,94 --> 00:02:31,21
And while the events of this past month
are sadly not new,

31
00:02:31,28 --> 00:02:32,45
they have caused us to face

32
00:02:32,51 --> 00:02:36,69
long-standing institutional inequalities
and social injustices.

33
00:02:32,51 --> 00:02:36,69
long-standing institutional inequalities
and social injustices.

34
00:02:37,19 --> 00:02:41,39
This country was founded on the principles
of freedom and equality for all.

35
00:02:42,02 --> 00:02:46,20
For too many people and for too long,
we haven't lived up to those ideals.

36
00:02:47,03 --> 00:02:48,30
We're inspired and moved

37
00:02:47,03 --> 00:02:48,30
We're inspired and moved

38
00:02:48,36 --> 00:02:51,80
by the passionate people around our nation
and around the world

39
00:02:51,87 --> 00:02:53,94
who have stood up to demand change.

40
00:02:54,40 --> 00:02:59,74
We must all aim far higher to build
a future that lives up to our ideals.

41
00:03:00,14 --> 00:03:01,84
This means taking action.

42
00:03:02,51 --> 00:03:07,15
Two weeks ago, we announced Apple's
Racial Equity and Justice Initiative

43
00:03:02,51 --> 00:03:07,15
Two weeks ago, we announced Apple's
Racial Equity and Justice Initiative

44
00:03:07,22 --> 00:03:09,79
with a commitment
of one hundred million dollars.

45
00:03:10,32 --> 00:03:13,69
Starting in the United States,
and expanding over time,

Starting in the United States,
and expanding over time,

47
00:03:13,76 --> 00:03:16,26
this initiative will challenge
systemic barriers

48
00:03:16,33 --> 00:03:19,13
that limit opportunity
for communities of color

49
00:03:16,33 --> 00:03:19,13
that limit opportunity
for communities of color

50
00:03:19,19 --> 00:03:24,60
in the critical areas of education,
economic equality and criminal justice.

51
00:03:19,19 --> 00:03:24,60
in the critical areas of education,
economic equality and criminal justice.

52
00:03:25,33 --> 00:03:28,80
We also announced something important
for this community,

53
00:03:28,87 --> 00:03:32,34
the new Developer Entrepreneur Camp
for Black developers.

54
00:03:28,87 --> 00:03:32,34

We want to do everything we can to foster
the brightest lights and best ideas.

and we're committed
to being a force for change.

also battling a virus

also battling a virus

62
00:03:48,82 --> 00:03:51,89

the daily lives of billions of people.

everywhere,

We want to thank the dedicated people
everywhere,

who have made tremendous sacrifices
to take care of those in need.

67
00:03:57,40 --> 00:04:01,14
who have made tremendous sacrifices
to take care of those in need.

68
00:04:02,00 --> 00:04:05,77
We've also seen the profound impact
our products have had.

69
00:04:06,64 --> 00:04:11,55
People are relying on them more than ever
to remain connected to family and friends,

70
00:04:11,61 --> 00:04:14,35
to do their work,
to express their creativity,

71
00:04:11,61 --> 00:04:14,35
to do their work,
to express their creativity,

72
00:04:14,42 --> 00:04:17,12
to be entertained
as well as to entertain others.

73
00:04:17,62 --> 00:04:20,82
Today the world is counting on all of us,

74
00:04:17,62 --> 00:04:20,82
Today the world is counting on all of us,

75
00:04:20,89 --> 00:04:24,59
and on the products and experiences
that we create, to move forward.

76
00:04:20,89 --> 00:04:24,59
and on the products and experiences
that we create, to move forward.

77
00:04:25,46 --> 00:04:26,96
Because throughout history,

78
00:04:27,03 --> 00:04:31,50
great challenges have been met with great
creativity and important breakthroughs.

79
00:04:27,03 --> 00:04:31,50
great challenges have been met with great
creativity and important breakthroughs.

80
00:04:32,07 --> 00:04:35,57
That's why we're so excited
about this year's conference.

81
00:04:35,64 --> 00:04:38,04
This is going to be truly a unique week,

82
00:04:35,64 --> 00:04:38,04
This is going to be truly a unique week,

83
00:04:38,11 --> 00:04:40,51
delivered unlike any
that we've done before.

84
00:04:41,44 --> 00:04:44,45
There will be more than a hundred
engineering-led video sessions,

85
00:04:41,44 --> 00:04:44,45
There will be more than a hundred
engineering-led video sessions,

86
00:04:44,51 --> 00:04:47,08
one-on-one consultations
with Apple engineers,

87
00:04:47,15 --> 00:04:49,69
developer forums and so much more,

88
00:04:47,15 --> 00:04:49,69
developer forums and so much more,

89
00:04:49,75 --> 00:04:53,86
delivered to you from different locations
right here at Apple Park.

90
00:04:54,59 --> 00:04:56,69
And this year,
the conference will be available

91
00:04:56,76 --> 00:05:00,06
to our entire community
of 23 million developers,

to our entire community
of 23 million developers,

93
00:05:00,13 --> 00:05:03,60
as well as anyone who is interested,
for free.

94
00:05:04,17 --> 00:05:08,57
Presenting the conference in this way
allows us to be more inclusive than ever.

95
00:05:04,17 --> 00:05:08,57
Presenting the conference in this way
allows us to be more inclusive than ever.

96
00:05:08,64 --> 00:05:11,97
Perhaps this will inspire
the next generation of developers.

97
00:05:12,54 --> 00:05:15,18
So even though
we can't be together in person,

98
00:05:15,24 --> 00:05:17,95
in some ways we're going to be
more together than ever.

99
00:05:18,78 --> 00:05:21,28
Today we're going to push
each of our platforms forward

100
00:05:21,35 --> 00:05:23,89
in some exciting and breakthrough ways.

101
00:05:23,95 --> 00:05:26,86
With that, let's get started
by sending it over to Craig.

102
00:05:23,95 --> 00:05:26,86
With that, let's get started
by sending it over to Craig.

103
00:05:34,20 --> 00:05:37,07
Good morning. Great to have you here.

104

Good morning. Great to have you here.

105
00:05:37,13 --> 00:05:42,14
As you can see, we've got a lot to cover,
so let's get started with iOS.

106
00:05:37,13 --> 00:05:42,14
As you can see, we've got a lot to cover,
so let's get started with iOS.

107
00:05:44,11 --> 00:05:45,24
Together with iPhone,

108
00:05:45,31 --> 00:05:49,61
iOS is central to how we navigate
our lives and stay connected.

109
00:05:45,31 --> 00:05:49,61
iOS is central to how we navigate
our lives and stay connected.

110
00:05:49,68 --> 00:05:53,32
And now we're making it
even more powerful and easier to use.

111
00:05:53,98 --> 00:05:56,95
Our new release is iOS 14.

112
00:05:53,98 --> 00:05:56,95
Our new release is iOS 14.

113
00:05:57,82 --> 00:05:59,96
This year we've spent time rethinking

114
00:06:00,02 --> 00:06:03,86
some of the most iconic elements
of the experience on iPhone.

115
00:06:03,93 --> 00:06:05,36
Now it all started here,

116
00:06:05,43 --> 00:06:09,77
with a carefully considered Home Screen
that has truly stood the test of time.

117
00:06:05,43 --> 00:06:09,77
with a carefully considered Home Screen
that has truly stood the test of time.

118
00:06:09,83 --> 00:06:13,20
Of course, over the years, we've kept
the fundamentals largely the same

119
00:06:09,83 --> 00:06:13,20
Of course, over the years, we've kept
the fundamentals largely the same

120
00:06:13,27 --> 00:06:17,61
but carefully added features
like folders for organizing your apps,

121
00:06:17,67 --> 00:06:19,61
widgets for quick information

122
00:06:17,67 --> 00:06:19,61
widgets for quick information

123
00:06:19,68 --> 00:06:23,41
and personalized experiences
powered by on-device intelligence

124
00:06:23,48 --> 00:06:27,08
that serve up just the right thing
at just the right moment.

125
00:06:23,48 --> 00:06:27,08
that serve up just the right thing
at just the right moment.

126
00:06:27,15 --> 00:06:30,35
It's hard to imagine iPhone
without these features now.

127
00:06:27,15 --> 00:06:30,35
It's hard to imagine iPhone
without these features now.

128
00:06:30,42 --> 00:06:32,52
Well, that brings us to this year.

129
00:06:32,59 --> 00:06:35,39
We're doing more on our iPhones today
than ever before,

130
00:06:35,46 --> 00:06:39,46
so we've rethought some of
the core elements of iOS to reflect this.

131
00:06:35,46 --> 00:06:39,46
so we've rethought some of
the core elements of iOS to reflect this.

132
00:06:39,53 --> 00:06:41,33
Let me give you a quick peek.

133
00:06:42,20 --> 00:06:44,87
["Like This Like That" by
BEGINNERS &amp; Night Panda playing]

134
00:07:19,87 --> 00:07:21,54
This is gonna be amazing.

135
00:07:21,60 --> 00:07:24,37
Let's dig in,
starting with the Home Screen.

136
00:07:21,60 --> 00:07:24,37
Let's dig in,
starting with the Home Screen.

137
00:07:24,97 --> 00:07:28,58
Today's Home Screen works great,
but as we get more and more apps,

138
00:07:28,64 --> 00:07:29,95
we can end up with this:

139
00:07:30,01 --> 00:07:32,08
lots and lots of pages.

140
00:07:32,15 --> 00:07:34,55
And we tend to forget
what's beyond the first couple.

141
00:07:34,95 --> 00:07:36,02
Wouldn't it be great

142
00:07:34,95 --> 00:07:36,02
Wouldn't it be great

143
00:07:36,08 --> 00:07:40,09
if there were a way to organize
all of those apps without doing a thing?

144
00:07:40,16 --> 00:07:44,53
Well, this year we're doing just that
with something called the App Library.

145
00:07:40,16 --> 00:07:44,53
Well, this year we're doing just that
with something called the App Library.

146
00:07:44,59 --> 00:07:47,26
It's a new space
at the end of your Home Screen pages

147
00:07:47,33 --> 00:07:49,83
that automatically organizes all your apps

148
00:07:47,33 --> 00:07:49,83
that automatically organizes all your apps

149
00:07:49,90 --> 00:07:52,87
in one simple and easy-to-navigate view.

150
00:07:52,94 --> 00:07:53,94
Let me show you.

151
00:07:57,81 --> 00:07:59,01
Here's my Home Screen.

152
00:07:59,07 --> 00:08:03,31
Now, like you, I have muscle memory built
for the first page or two,

153
00:07:59,07 --> 00:08:03,31
Now, like you, I have muscle memory built
for the first page or two,

154
00:08:03,38 --> 00:08:05,88
but when it comes to all of these pages,

155
00:08:05,95 --> 00:08:08,92
well, honestly, I've lost track
of where a lot of things are.

156
00:08:05,95 --> 00:08:08,92
well, honestly, I've lost track
of where a lot of things are.

157
00:08:08,98 --> 00:08:11,69
And that's where the App Library comes in.

158
00:08:11,75 --> 00:08:15,32
You can see that all of my apps
are automatically organized here.

159
00:08:11,75 --> 00:08:15,32
You can see that all of my apps
are automatically organized here.

160
00:08:15,39 --> 00:08:17,13
In fact, now with the App Library,

161
00:08:17,19 --> 00:08:20,46
I actually don't need all those pages
for all my apps.

162
00:08:17,19 --> 00:08:20,46
I actually don't need all those pages
for all my apps.

163
00:08:20,53 --> 00:08:23,30
So we created an easy way
to hide app pages.

164
00:08:23,37 --> 00:08:26,40
I just go into jiggle mode,
tap the dots at the bottom,

165
00:08:23,37 --> 00:08:26,40
I just go into jiggle mode,
tap the dots at the bottom,

166
00:08:26,47 --> 00:08:27,47
and check this out,

167
00:08:27,54 --> 00:08:30,17
I get a zoomed-out view
of all my app pages.

168
00:08:27,54 --> 00:08:30,17
I get a zoomed-out view
of all my app pages.

169
00:08:30,24 --> 00:08:33,78
I can simply tap
to hide the pages I no longer need.

170
00:08:33,84 --> 00:08:35,44
Just like that.

171
00:08:35,51 --> 00:08:37,55
And now with those pages hidden,

172
00:08:35,51 --> 00:08:37,55
And now with those pages hidden,

173
00:08:37,61 --> 00:08:40,75
App Library is always
just a swipe or two away.

174
00:08:41,15 --> 00:08:45,15
So here in App Library, getting to the app
I'm looking for is really easy.

175
00:08:41,15 --> 00:08:45,15
So here in App Library, getting to the app
I'm looking for is really easy.

176
00:08:45,52 --> 00:08:47,76
Up at the top I have the Search field,

177
00:08:47,82 --> 00:08:50,83
and I get all my apps
organized from A to Z.

178
00:08:47,82 --> 00:08:50,83
and I get all my apps
organized from A to Z.

179
00:08:50,89 --> 00:08:54,46
Now over here on the upper left
I have Suggestions.

180
00:08:50,89 --> 00:08:54,46
Now over here on the upper left
I have Suggestions.

181
00:08:54,53 --> 00:08:56,23
It uses on-device intelligence

182
00:08:56,30 --> 00:08:59,00
to show me the apps
that I'm likely to need next.

183
00:08:59,07 --> 00:09:01,47
And on the right is Recently Added,

184
00:08:59,07 --> 00:09:01,47
And on the right is Recently Added,

185
00:09:01,54 --> 00:09:05,04
giving me access to the apps that I've
recently downloaded from the App Store.

186
00:09:05,44 --> 00:09:08,11
And below are
intelligently curated categories.

187
00:09:05,44 --> 00:09:08,11
And below are
intelligently curated categories.

188
00:09:08,51 --> 00:09:11,65
So I can tap into a category
like Apple Arcade

189
00:09:11,71 --> 00:09:14,38
and see all of my apps in that category.

190
00:09:11,71 --> 00:09:14,38
and see all of my apps in that category.

191
00:09:14,78 --> 00:09:16,05
Now let's go back.

192
00:09:16,12 --> 00:09:18,22
You may notice
that in each of these categories

193
00:09:16,12 --> 00:09:18,22
You may notice
that in each of these categories

194
00:09:18,29 --> 00:09:21,09
the apps I use most are right here
at the top level,

195
00:09:21,39 --> 00:09:25,66
so I can launch one of these directly
with just a tap.

196
00:09:21,39 --> 00:09:25,66
so I can launch one of these directly
with just a tap.

197
00:09:25,73 --> 00:09:28,06
So that's App Library.

198
00:09:28,13 --> 00:09:32,00
We think this is gonna make it
easier than ever to get to your apps.

199
00:09:28,13 --> 00:09:32,00
We think this is gonna make it
easier than ever to get to your apps.

200
00:09:32,50 --> 00:09:35,10
Next, let's turn to Widgets.

201
00:09:36,14 --> 00:09:39,01
Today, widgets help you get information
at a glance.

202
00:09:39,07 --> 00:09:41,64
But a lot has changed
since we first introduced these.

203
00:09:42,01 --> 00:09:45,95
Now we have Apple Watch, where we're able
to surface so much information

204
00:09:46,01 --> 00:09:48,35
on a small screen
that you wear on your wrist.

205
00:09:46,01 --> 00:09:48,35
on a small screen
that you wear on your wrist.

206
00:09:48,42 --> 00:09:50,82
Well, this year,
we're taking all that we've learned

207
00:09:50,89 --> 00:09:53,86
to create a completely reimagined
experience for widgets.

208
00:09:54,46 --> 00:09:57,69
To start,
they're more beautiful and data rich.

209
00:09:57,76 --> 00:09:59,39
And we're introducing different sizes,

210
00:09:59,46 --> 00:10:01,93
so you can choose one
that best fits your needs.

211
00:09:59,46 --> 00:10:01,93
so you can choose one
that best fits your needs.

212
00:10:02,43 --> 00:10:05,37
Let's take a look at them in iOS 14.

213
00:10:06,54 --> 00:10:10,91
So let's swipe over to Today View
and take a look at our new widgets.

214
00:10:10,97 --> 00:10:12,27
They're just beautiful.

215
00:10:10,97 --> 00:10:12,27
They're just beautiful.

216
00:10:12,34 --> 00:10:15,11
And the new designs are
more data rich than ever.

217
00:10:15,61 --> 00:10:19,52
And you can see
they now come in a variety of sizes.

218
00:10:15,61 --> 00:10:19,52
And you can see
they now come in a variety of sizes.

219
00:10:19,58 --> 00:10:22,65
So you can pick just the right level
of information for each one.

220
00:10:22,72 --> 00:10:25,25
Now we like these new widgets so much,

221
00:10:22,72 --> 00:10:25,25
Now we like these new widgets so much,

222
00:10:25,32 --> 00:10:27,56
we wanted to make them
even more accessible.

223
00:10:28,02 --> 00:10:29,02
So check this out.

224
00:10:29,09 --> 00:10:31,33
I'm just gonna tap and hold
on the Weather widget,

225
00:10:29,09 --> 00:10:31,33
I'm just gonna tap and hold
on the Weather widget,

226
00:10:31,39 --> 00:10:35,36
and I can drag it out of Today View
and onto my Home Screen.

227
00:10:35,63 --> 00:10:37,47
And watch, as I move it around,

228
00:10:35,63 --> 00:10:37,47
And watch, as I move it around,

229
00:10:37,53 --> 00:10:41,27
the apps just dance out of the way
to make space for my new widget.

230
00:10:41,34 --> 00:10:42,77
Let's add a second one.

231
00:10:41,34 --> 00:10:42,77
Let's add a second one.

232
00:10:42,84 --> 00:10:45,17
Just gonna tap the plus
here in the upper left

233
00:10:45,24 --> 00:10:46,84
and grab on to Podcasts.

234
00:10:47,18 --> 00:10:49,11
I can drop it just like that.

235
00:10:47,18 --> 00:10:49,11
I can drop it just like that.

236
00:10:49,18 --> 00:10:53,62
Now I'm gonna swipe over to page 2 here
and bring back up the Widget Gallery.

237
00:10:53,98 --> 00:10:56,49
The gallery is a great place
to explore widgets.

238
00:10:53,98 --> 00:10:56,49
The gallery is a great place
to explore widgets.

239
00:10:56,89 --> 00:10:58,75
Now when I tap on one,

240
00:10:59,05 --> 00:11:02,93
I can actually page through
all of the different sizes available.

241
00:10:59,05 --> 00:11:02,93
I can actually page through
all of the different sizes available.

242
00:11:02,99 --> 00:11:04,09
Just like this.

243
00:11:04,16 --> 00:11:07,10
But, you know, right now what I want to do
is grab this widget up top.

244
00:11:04,16 --> 00:11:07,10
But, you know, right now what I want to do
is grab this widget up top.

245
00:11:07,16 --> 00:11:09,97
It's a really special one.
It's called the Smart Stack.

246
00:11:10,03 --> 00:11:12,30
Just gonna tap it and drop it here.

247
00:11:10,03 --> 00:11:12,30
Just gonna tap it and drop it here.

248
00:11:12,97 --> 00:11:16,57
With the Smart Stack,
I can easily swipe through widgets

249
00:11:16,64 --> 00:11:19,51
to pick just the one I want
for the moment.

250
00:11:16,64 --> 00:11:19,51
to pick just the one I want
for the moment.

251
00:11:19,88 --> 00:11:21,34
But what's really cool

252
00:11:21,41 --> 00:11:26,25
is that the Smart Stack can
actually do this for me automatically.

253
00:11:21,41 --> 00:11:26,25
is that the Smart Stack can
actually do this for me automatically.

254
00:11:26,72 --> 00:11:29,35
So in the morning,
I can get my news briefing.

255
00:11:29,79 --> 00:11:33,02
Throughout the day,
find out when I have a meeting coming up.

256
00:11:29,79 --> 00:11:33,02
Throughout the day,
find out when I have a meeting coming up.

257
00:11:33,42 --> 00:11:36,43
And in the evening, I might get
a summary of my activity for the day.

258
00:11:33,42 --> 00:11:36,43
And in the evening, I might get
a summary of my activity for the day.

259
00:11:36,86 --> 00:11:39,06
So that's widgets on the Home Screen.

260
00:11:39,13 --> 00:11:42,80
We're excited to see how everyone
will customize them in their own way.

261
00:11:39,13 --> 00:11:42,80
We're excited to see how everyone
will customize them in their own way.

262
00:11:43,23 --> 00:11:46,94
Next, we're also bringing
Picture in Picture to iPhone.

263
00:11:47,84 --> 00:11:49,64
So you can access apps on your iPhone

264
00:11:47,84 --> 00:11:49,64
So you can access apps on your iPhone

265
00:11:49,71 --> 00:11:52,84
while watching video
or talking on a FaceTime call.

266
00:11:53,34 --> 00:11:54,48
Let me show you.

267
00:11:53,34 --> 00:11:54,48
Let me show you.

268
00:11:54,88 --> 00:11:56,18
So here on my Home Screen,

269
00:11:56,25 --> 00:11:58,08
the Smart Stack
is showing me the TV widget.

270
00:11:58,15 --> 00:12:00,72
So I can just tap to start playing a show.

271
00:11:58,15 --> 00:12:00,72
So I can just tap to start playing a show.

272
00:12:01,18 --> 00:12:04,09
Now check this out.
When I swipe to go Home,

273
00:12:04,15 --> 00:12:06,92
the video automatically goes
into Picture in Picture

274
00:12:04,15 --> 00:12:06,92
the video automatically goes
into Picture in Picture

275
00:12:06,99 --> 00:12:08,29
right over the Home Screen.

276
00:12:08,76 --> 00:12:13,23
And when I launch another app, like Notes,
I can keep watching.

277
00:12:08,76 --> 00:12:13,23
And when I launch another app, like Notes,
I can keep watching.

278
00:12:13,73 --> 00:12:17,43
Now I can drag the picture
to another part of the screen.

279
00:12:17,50 --> 00:12:20,67
If I want to make it bigger,
I can even pinch to zoom.

280
00:12:17,50 --> 00:12:20,67
If I want to make it bigger,
I can even pinch to zoom.

281
00:12:20,74 --> 00:12:24,54
And as I move between applications
it stays with me.

282
00:12:20,74 --> 00:12:24,54
And as I move between applications
it stays with me.

283
00:12:24,87 --> 00:12:28,14
And what's cool is
I can also swipe it to the side,

284
00:12:28,21 --> 00:12:31,28
and the audio keeps playing
when it's off-screen.

285
00:12:28,21 --> 00:12:31,28
and the audio keeps playing
when it's off-screen.

286
00:12:32,15 --> 00:12:35,55
Now here on the Home Screen
I can bring it back out if I want.

287
00:12:36,52 --> 00:12:39,29
And I have controls
to get back to full-screen playback,

288
00:12:39,69 --> 00:12:42,86
or I can just tap the "X" to close it.

289
00:12:39,69 --> 00:12:42,86
or I can just tap the "X" to close it.

290
00:12:43,33 --> 00:12:45,49
And that's Picture in Picture video.

291
00:12:45,56 --> 00:12:48,23
It's a great way
to continue enjoying your video

292
00:12:45,56 --> 00:12:48,23
It's a great way
to continue enjoying your video

293
00:12:48,30 --> 00:12:51,63
while tapping into everything else
your iPhone can do for you.

294
00:12:52,27 --> 00:12:56,37
And that's a quick look at the updates
to the core elements of iOS.

295
00:12:52,27 --> 00:12:56,37
And that's a quick look at the updates
to the core elements of iOS.

296
00:12:56,44 --> 00:13:00,08
We think these new features are gonna
make iOS even more helpful in the moment.

297
00:12:56,44 --> 00:13:00,08
We think these new features are gonna
make iOS even more helpful in the moment.

298
00:13:00,58 --> 00:13:04,58
Another iconic experience
that's getting a major update is Siri.

299
00:13:06,38 --> 00:13:08,35
As much as Siri has advanced
over the years,

300
00:13:08,42 --> 00:13:12,45
the visual interface for interacting
with it has remained largely unchanged.

301
00:13:08,42 --> 00:13:12,45
the visual interface for interacting
with it has remained largely unchanged.

302
00:13:12,52 --> 00:13:15,79
When you use Siri, your iPhone
switches to this full-screen UI,

303
00:13:15,86 --> 00:13:17,46
obscuring your current context.

304
00:13:17,93 --> 00:13:21,33
So this year, we've completely redesigned
the Siri experience

305
00:13:17,93 --> 00:13:21,33
So this year, we've completely redesigned
the Siri experience

306
00:13:21,40 --> 00:13:23,00
with a new compact design.

307
00:13:23,40 --> 00:13:26,54
It makes tasks like launching apps
incredibly seamless.

308
00:13:23,40 --> 00:13:26,54
It makes tasks like launching apps
incredibly seamless.

309
00:13:26,60 --> 00:13:29,24
For example, if you say, "Open Safari,"

310
00:13:29,67 --> 00:13:33,01
Siri pops up at the bottom of the screen
and instantly launches the app.

311
00:13:29,67 --> 00:13:33,01
Siri pops up at the bottom of the screen
and instantly launches the app.

312
00:13:33,51 --> 00:13:35,78
Or if you ask for information,
like the weather,

313
00:13:35,84 --> 00:13:39,45
results appear at the top of the screen
just like a notification.

314
00:13:35,84 --> 00:13:39,45
results appear at the top of the screen
just like a notification.

315
00:13:39,92 --> 00:13:41,32
Now this is especially great

316
00:13:41,38 --> 00:13:43,75
when there's information
you want to reference on-screen.

317
00:13:41,38 --> 00:13:43,75
when there's information
you want to reference on-screen.

318
00:13:44,09 --> 00:13:46,82
For example, you could ask Siri
to add to your grocery list.

319
00:13:47,72 --> 00:13:51,46
So that's the new Siri design in iOS 14.

320
00:13:47,72 --> 00:13:51,46
So that's the new Siri design in iOS 14.

321
00:13:51,53 --> 00:13:54,13
But the UI is only part of the story.

322
00:13:51,53 --> 00:13:54,13
But the UI is only part of the story.

323
00:13:54,20 --> 00:13:57,20
To tell you more about
how we're making Siri smarter than ever,

324
00:13:57,53 --> 00:13:59,50
I'll hand it off to Yael Garten.

325
00:14:00,24 --> 00:14:01,27
Thanks, Craig.

326
00:14:01,34 --> 00:14:04,51
Siri's getting smarter
and even more helpful every day,

327
00:14:04,57 --> 00:14:06,88
and I'm really excited to share
the latest updates with you.

328
00:14:04,57 --> 00:14:06,88
and I'm really excited to share
the latest updates with you.

329
00:14:07,34 --> 00:14:09,75
Siri helps you in a ton of little ways
every day:

330
00:14:10,08 --> 00:14:13,85
playing the morning news,
ordering a coffee, getting directions,

331
00:14:10,08 --> 00:14:13,85
playing the morning news,
ordering a coffee, getting directions,

332
00:14:13,92 --> 00:14:16,92
setting the alarm before going to bed
and so much more.

333
00:14:17,49 --> 00:14:20,09
In fact, Siri's helping so many of you

334
00:14:17,49 --> 00:14:20,09
In fact, Siri's helping so many of you

335
00:14:20,16 --> 00:14:22,93
with a staggering 25 billion requests
each month.

336
00:14:23,43 --> 00:14:25,89
And Siri's getting more helpful every day.

337
00:14:23,43 --> 00:14:25,89
And Siri's getting more helpful every day.

338
00:14:26,40 --> 00:14:28,50
Siri's always been great
for getting information

339
00:14:28,56 --> 00:14:31,93
and now has over 20 times more facts
than just three years ago.

340
00:14:28,56 --> 00:14:31,93
and now has over 20 times more facts
than just three years ago.

341
00:14:32,47 --> 00:14:33,67
For more complex questions

342
00:14:33,74 --> 00:14:37,41
like "How do hybrid cars work?"
or "What causes seasons?",

343
00:14:33,74 --> 00:14:37,41
like "How do hybrid cars work?"
or "What causes seasons?",

344
00:14:37,47 --> 00:14:40,98
we recently introduced answers
from websites across the Internet,

345
00:14:41,04 --> 00:14:43,85
enabling Siri to help you
find even more answers.

346
00:14:41,04 --> 00:14:43,85
enabling Siri to help you
find even more answers.

347
00:14:44,58 --> 00:14:48,55
Another way Siri helps is
with communication, like sending messages.

348
00:14:44,58 --> 00:14:48,55
Another way Siri helps is
with communication, like sending messages.

349
00:14:48,62 --> 00:14:52,02
This year, you can now ask Siri
to send an audio message,

350
00:14:52,09 --> 00:14:53,56
and Siri will start recording.

351
00:14:53,92 --> 00:14:57,66
This is great when you really want to have
the emotion of your voice come through.

352
00:14:53,92 --> 00:14:57,66
This is great when you really want to have
the emotion of your voice come through.

353
00:14:58,23 --> 00:15:01,56
Another popular way to send messages
with your voice is using dictation.

354
00:14:58,23 --> 00:15:01,56
Another popular way to send messages
with your voice is using dictation.

355
00:15:01,96 --> 00:15:05,37
Keyboard Dictation uses
the same speech recognition as Siri.

356
00:15:05,77 --> 00:15:08,64
And leveraging
the power of the Neural Engine,

357
00:15:05,77 --> 00:15:08,64
And leveraging
the power of the Neural Engine,

358
00:15:08,70 --> 00:15:11,57
we are now able
to run dictation on-device.

359
00:15:12,01 --> 00:15:14,84
This provides great accuracy and privacy.

360
00:15:15,91 --> 00:15:19,85
When communicating with someone in another
language, Siri can help with translations.

361
00:15:15,91 --> 00:15:19,85
When communicating with someone in another
language, Siri can help with translations.

362
00:15:20,32 --> 00:15:23,62
This year we're expanding
to support many new language pairs.

363
00:15:23,69 --> 00:15:25,05
This is hugely popular,

364
00:15:23,69 --> 00:15:25,05
This is hugely popular,

365
00:15:25,12 --> 00:15:28,19
but we know our users want
more than just translating phrases.

366
00:15:28,26 --> 00:15:30,46
They want to have entire conversations.

367
00:15:28,26 --> 00:15:30,46
They want to have entire conversations.

368
00:15:30,53 --> 00:15:32,96
And we believe conversations
between languages

369
00:15:33,03 --> 00:15:37,30
should feel natural and easy
and have the ability to stay private.

370
00:15:33,03 --> 00:15:37,30
should feel natural and easy
and have the ability to stay private.

371
00:15:37,77 --> 00:15:41,24
That's why we're introducing
a new app called Translate.

372
00:15:42,17 --> 00:15:46,28
It is designed to be the best
and easiest-to-use app for conversations.

373
00:15:46,34 --> 00:15:50,51
And it can work completely off-line,
keeping your conversations private.

374
00:15:46,34 --> 00:15:50,51
And it can work completely off-line,
keeping your conversations private.

375
00:15:51,01 --> 00:15:54,62
Using advanced on-device machine learning
and the powerful Neural Engine,

376
00:15:51,01 --> 00:15:54,62
Using advanced on-device machine learning
and the powerful Neural Engine,

377
00:15:54,95 --> 00:15:56,65
you can translate your text and voice

378
00:15:56,72 --> 00:15:59,39
between any combination
of these 11 languages.

379
00:15:59,89 --> 00:16:02,72
So I could have a conversation
with someone in Mandarin,

380
00:15:59,89 --> 00:16:02,72
So I could have a conversation
with someone in Mandarin,

381
00:16:02,99 --> 00:16:05,69
and they could have a conversation
with someone in Russian.

382
00:16:06,03 --> 00:16:09,13
Just tap on the microphone and say,
"What are your store hours?"

383
00:16:09,70 --> 00:16:11,73
[Siri reads Spanish translation]

384
00:16:11,80 --> 00:16:14,00
[Yael] You get back
the text and audio right away.

385
00:16:11,80 --> 00:16:14,00
[Yael] You get back
the text and audio right away.

386
00:16:14,37 --> 00:16:18,11
And just turn the phone to landscape
to open conversation mode.

387
00:16:14,37 --> 00:16:18,11
And just turn the phone to landscape
to open conversation mode.

388
00:16:18,17 --> 00:16:20,14
We've designed a side-by-side view

389
00:16:20,21 --> 00:16:24,08
that's easy for two people to know
which side to follow in the conversation.

390
00:16:20,21 --> 00:16:24,08
that's easy for two people to know
which side to follow in the conversation.

391
00:16:24,48 --> 00:16:27,95
This mode is incredibly intuitive,
with just a single microphone button

392
00:16:28,02 --> 00:16:31,45
because the app intelligently detects
the language spoken

393
00:16:28,02 --> 00:16:31,45
because the app intelligently detects
the language spoken

394
00:16:31,52 --> 00:16:34,19
and shows translation
on the correct side of the screen.

395
00:16:35,02 --> 00:16:39,16
Translate will make communicating
between languages easier than ever before,

396
00:16:35,02 --> 00:16:39,16
Translate will make communicating
between languages easier than ever before,

397
00:16:39,23 --> 00:16:41,03
connecting people in new ways.

398
00:16:41,10 --> 00:16:43,27
And we can't wait for you to try it.

399
00:16:41,10 --> 00:16:43,27
And we can't wait for you to try it.

400
00:16:43,73 --> 00:16:44,93
Thanks, Yael.

401
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:47,07
Next up, Messages.

402
00:16:47,77 --> 00:16:51,71
Messages is how many of us communicate
with people most important to us.

403
00:16:47,77 --> 00:16:51,71
Messages is how many of us communicate
with people most important to us.

404
00:16:52,27 --> 00:16:54,24
And now we're using it more than ever.

405
00:16:52,27 --> 00:16:54,24
And now we're using it more than ever.

406
00:16:54,31 --> 00:16:55,68
Compared to just a year ago,

407
00:16:55,74 --> 00:16:59,58
we have a record number of users
sending a record number of messages.

408
00:16:59,98 --> 00:17:02,22
And we've seen people use Messages
more and more

409
00:16:59,98 --> 00:17:02,22
And we've seen people use Messages
more and more

410
00:17:02,28 --> 00:17:04,95
to keep in touch
with their closest groups.

411
00:17:05,02 --> 00:17:06,72
This year, we're introducing

412
00:17:05,02 --> 00:17:06,72
This year, we're introducing

413
00:17:06,79 --> 00:17:10,13
a new way to stay connected
with your most important conversations,

414
00:17:10,19 --> 00:17:13,26
giving you new ways
to express your identity with Memoji

415
00:17:10,19 --> 00:17:13,26
giving you new ways
to express your identity with Memoji

416
00:17:13,70 --> 00:17:17,23
and making big changes
to how we communicate in groups.

417
00:17:17,73 --> 00:17:20,33
To tell you more, here's Stacey Lysik.

418
00:17:17,73 --> 00:17:20,33
To tell you more, here's Stacey Lysik.

419
00:17:20,87 --> 00:17:21,87
Thanks, Craig.

420
00:17:21,94 --> 00:17:25,04
First, let's get started
with Conversations.

421
00:17:21,94 --> 00:17:25,04
First, let's get started
with Conversations.

422
00:17:25,11 --> 00:17:27,01
From the beginning, Messages was designed

423
00:17:27,07 --> 00:17:29,75
to make it really easy
to get to your newest messages.

424
00:17:29,81 --> 00:17:31,81
But with so many active conversations,

425
00:17:29,81 --> 00:17:31,81
But with so many active conversations,

426
00:17:31,88 --> 00:17:35,28
sometimes it can be tough to get to
the ones that are most important to you.

427
00:17:35,98 --> 00:17:38,09
So we are introducing a new way

428
00:17:35,98 --> 00:17:38,09
So we are introducing a new way

429
00:17:38,15 --> 00:17:41,79
to let you stay connected
to your most important conversations:

430
00:17:41,86 --> 00:17:44,33
by letting you pin them
at the top of your list

431
00:17:41,86 --> 00:17:44,33
by letting you pin them
at the top of your list

432
00:17:44,39 --> 00:17:45,89
so you can always get to them.

433
00:17:46,50 --> 00:17:50,87
And you can see messages as they come in
with a beautiful animation on the pin.

434
00:17:46,50 --> 00:17:50,87
And you can see messages as they come in
with a beautiful animation on the pin.

435
00:17:51,33 --> 00:17:54,34
Next, let's talk about expressing yourself
with Memoji.

436
00:17:51,33 --> 00:17:54,34
Next, let's talk about expressing yourself
with Memoji.

437
00:17:55,57 --> 00:17:59,58
There are over one trillion ways
to customize your identity with Memoji.

438
00:18:00,01 --> 00:18:03,41
In iOS 14, we're adding even more ways
to create your look

439
00:18:03,48 --> 00:18:06,32
with over 20 new hair and headwear styles

440
00:18:03,48 --> 00:18:06,32
with over 20 new hair and headwear styles

441
00:18:06,38 --> 00:18:10,02
to let you reflect your hobby, profession
and personality.

442
00:18:10,62 --> 00:18:14,52
We've also added something that's
even more relevant today: face coverings.

443
00:18:10,62 --> 00:18:14,52
We've also added something that's
even more relevant today: face coverings.

444
00:18:15,22 --> 00:18:17,89
And we're adding more age options too.

445
00:18:18,43 --> 00:18:22,13
My favorite way of using Memoji
is with Memoji stickers.

446
00:18:22,53 --> 00:18:24,83
And now we have
three brand-new Memoji stickers

447
00:18:22,53 --> 00:18:24,83
And now we have
three brand-new Memoji stickers

448
00:18:24,90 --> 00:18:29,14
that let you send a hug, a fist bump
or even a blush to your friends.

449
00:18:29,81 --> 00:18:31,81
Last, let's chat about groups.

450
00:18:29,81 --> 00:18:31,81
Last, let's chat about groups.

451
00:18:32,31 --> 00:18:35,18
When you're talking to a group,
sometimes there's so much going on,

452
00:18:35,24 --> 00:18:37,55
it can be hard to keep track
of the conversation.

453
00:18:35,24 --> 00:18:37,55
it can be hard to keep track
of the conversation.

454
00:18:37,61 --> 00:18:40,65
So this year, we're gonna help you
bring order to the chaos.

455
00:18:41,42 --> 00:18:43,19
First we're adding inline replies

456
00:18:41,42 --> 00:18:43,19
First we're adding inline replies

457
00:18:43,25 --> 00:18:45,72
that let you reply
directly to a specific message.

458
00:18:46,12 --> 00:18:48,46
You can view replies
in the full conversation

459
00:18:46,12 --> 00:18:48,46
You can view replies
in the full conversation

460
00:18:48,52 --> 00:18:53,06
or you can view them as their own thread
so you can focus in on the specific topic.

461
00:18:53,53 --> 00:18:56,20
To make it even more clear
who a message was meant for,

462
00:18:53,53 --> 00:18:56,20
To make it even more clear
who a message was meant for,

463
00:18:56,27 --> 00:18:57,67
we're introducing mentions.

464
00:18:58,23 --> 00:19:00,34
With mentions,
you can just type someone's name

465
00:18:58,23 --> 00:19:00,34
With mentions,
you can just type someone's name

466
00:19:00,40 --> 00:19:01,87
to direct a message to them.

467
00:19:02,54 --> 00:19:05,11
And now you have the ability
to only be notified

468
00:19:05,17 --> 00:19:07,41
when you're mentioned
in the group conversation.

469
00:19:05,17 --> 00:19:07,41
when you're mentioned
in the group conversation.

470
00:19:07,88 --> 00:19:10,05
And check out
the top of this conversation.

471
00:19:10,11 --> 00:19:12,58
We have an all-new design
for how groups appear.

472
00:19:10,11 --> 00:19:12,58
We have an all-new design
for how groups appear.

473
00:19:13,05 --> 00:19:14,85
It lets you see
all the members of your group,

474
00:19:14,92 --> 00:19:17,62
where the most recently active people
are shown largest.

475
00:19:18,12 --> 00:19:19,52
And, for the first time ever,

476
00:19:19,59 --> 00:19:23,23
you can create a unique visual identity
for your group

477
00:19:23,29 --> 00:19:24,69
by setting a group photo

478
00:19:23,29 --> 00:19:24,69
by setting a group photo

479
00:19:25,16 --> 00:19:27,63
or customizing your group's look
with an emoji.

480
00:19:28,53 --> 00:19:30,03
Inside the conversation

481
00:19:28,53 --> 00:19:30,03
Inside the conversation

482
00:19:30,10 --> 00:19:32,63
you see group members' photos
around the image.

483
00:19:32,70 --> 00:19:34,84
Of course it looks great as a pin.

484
00:19:35,47 --> 00:19:37,51
You know who's most recently commented
in the group

485
00:19:35,47 --> 00:19:37,51
You know who's most recently commented
in the group

486
00:19:37,57 --> 00:19:40,64
because their photo will appear
around the outside of the pin.

487
00:19:40,71 --> 00:19:43,75
And that's what's coming to Messages
in iOS 14:

488
00:19:40,71 --> 00:19:43,75
And that's what's coming to Messages
in iOS 14:

489
00:19:43,81 --> 00:19:47,38
all-new pinned conversations,
fun updates to Memoji

490
00:19:47,45 --> 00:19:49,48
and powerful improvements to groups.

491
00:19:47,45 --> 00:19:49,48
and powerful improvements to groups.

492
00:19:50,05 --> 00:19:51,29
Thanks, Stacey.

493
00:19:51,35 --> 00:19:55,19
Next, let's take a look at features
that help us while we're out and about.

494
00:19:51,35 --> 00:19:55,19
Next, let's take a look at features
that help us while we're out and about.

495
00:19:55,72 --> 00:19:59,39
Now we know that life looks very different
for many of us right now,

496
00:19:59,46 --> 00:20:01,16
but it won't always be this way.

497
00:19:59,46 --> 00:20:01,16
but it won't always be this way.

498
00:20:01,23 --> 00:20:02,93
And as things start to open up,

499
00:20:03,00 --> 00:20:06,37
we have a new set of features
that will help us explore the world again,

500
00:20:03,00 --> 00:20:06,37
we have a new set of features
that will help us explore the world again,

501
00:20:06,44 --> 00:20:08,17
starting with Maps.

502
00:20:08,94 --> 00:20:11,84
Apple Maps is the best way to navigate
and explore the world,

503
00:20:11,91 --> 00:20:13,68
all while protecting your privacy.

504
00:20:11,91 --> 00:20:13,68
all while protecting your privacy.

505
00:20:13,74 --> 00:20:16,61
Over the past several years,
we've added many great features,

506
00:20:16,68 --> 00:20:19,88
and of course we've been
rebuilding our map from the ground up.

507
00:20:16,68 --> 00:20:19,88
and of course we've been
rebuilding our map from the ground up.

508
00:20:20,38 --> 00:20:23,32
Our new map finished rolling out
across the US earlier this year

509
00:20:23,39 --> 00:20:26,59
and brought with it better navigation
and far richer detail

510
00:20:23,39 --> 00:20:26,59
and brought with it better navigation
and far richer detail

511
00:20:26,66 --> 00:20:29,89
for roads, pedestrian paths,
landcover and more.

512
00:20:30,36 --> 00:20:33,73
The new map also offers
more accurate information for places

513
00:20:33,80 --> 00:20:37,17
and allows us to build incredible features
like Look Around.

514
00:20:33,80 --> 00:20:37,17
and allows us to build incredible features
like Look Around.

515
00:20:37,23 --> 00:20:40,47
Maps has come a long way,

518
00:20:42,57 --> 00:20:45,54
"Apple Maps has improved
by leaps and bounds

519
00:20:45,61 --> 00:20:47,88
and is a formidable rival to Google Maps.

520
00:20:47,94 --> 00:20:50,18
It's also arguably got the better UI,

It's also arguably got the better UI,

522
00:20:50,25 --> 00:20:54,25
and by far-- by far--
the better privacy policy."

00:20:50,25 --> 00:20:54,25
and by far-- by far--
the better privacy policy."

524
00:20:54,72 --> 00:20:56,05
We're excited to announce

525
00:20:56,12 --> 00:20:59,25
we're bringing our new map
to more countries later this year,

526
00:20:59,32 --> 00:21:02,39
including the UK, Ireland and Canada.

527
00:20:59,32 --> 00:21:02,39

In addition to the rich detail
and improved accuracy,

530
00:21:06,09 --> 00:21:09,90
the new map serves as the foundation
for many great new features.

531
00:21:10,30 --> 00:21:12,47
In iOS 14, we're adding things

532
00:21:10,30 --> 00:21:12,47
In iOS 14, we're adding things

533
00:21:12,53 --> 00:21:15,47
that will make it easier
for people to find places they love

534
00:21:15,54 --> 00:21:17,21
and help them get to where they're going

535
00:21:17,27 --> 00:21:19,24
in ways that are better
for the environment.

536
00:21:17,27 --> 00:21:19,24
in ways that are better
for the environment.

537
00:21:19,68 --> 00:21:23,08
To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Meg Frost.

538
00:21:23,68 --> 00:21:24,81
Thanks, Craig.

539
00:21:23,68 --> 00:21:24,81
Thanks, Craig.

540
00:21:24,88 --> 00:21:28,12
First, let's talk about
finding great places.

541
00:21:28,18 --> 00:21:31,12
We have millions of people
coming to Maps every day

542

We have millions of people
coming to Maps every day

543

whether they're planning
their next big vacation

545
00:21:36,02 --> 00:21:38,16
or just looking for
something to eat nearby.

546
00:21:38,63 --> 00:21:40,06
In iOS 14,

547
00:21:40,13 --> 00:21:44,10
the Maps team will be working with
some of the world's most trusted brands

548

some of the world's most trusted brands

549
00:21:44,17 --> 00:21:46,67
to offer amazing Guides.

550
00:21:46,74 --> 00:21:49,64
Guides for great places to eat, shop,

You can save Guides
so you can easily get back to them later,

554
00:21:57,58 --> 00:22:01,25
and the best part is they automatically
update when new places are added,

555
00:21:57,58 --> 00:22:01,25
and the best part is they automatically
update when new places are added,

556
00:22:01,32 --> 00:22:04,65
so you always have
the latest recommendations.

557
00:22:05,09 --> 00:22:07,86
In addition to helping you
discover great new places,

558
00:22:05,09 --> 00:22:07,86
In addition to helping you
discover great new places,

559
00:22:07,92 --> 00:22:11,69
Maps helps you get there
in a way that's better for the planet.

560
00:22:11,76 --> 00:22:14,36
For years,
Maps has made it easy to navigate

561
00:22:11,76 --> 00:22:14,36
For years,
Maps has made it easy to navigate

562
00:22:14,43 --> 00:22:18,10
using environmentally-friendly options
like public transit and walking.

using environmentally-friendly options
like public transit and walking.

564
00:22:18,57 --> 00:22:21,74
With iOS 14,
we're introducing great new features

565
00:22:21,80 --> 00:22:24,34
to help our users
reduce their carbon footprint,

566
00:22:21,80 --> 00:22:24,34
to help our users
reduce their carbon footprint,

567
00:22:24,81 --> 00:22:28,21
and our first one is
also our most requested:

568
00:22:28,28 --> 00:22:29,61
It's Cycling.

569
00:22:30,51 --> 00:22:32,98
We've built an incredible
cycling experience

570
00:22:33,05 --> 00:22:35,35
that helps you get around town
on your bike.

571
00:22:36,12 --> 00:22:38,95
We're adding a dedicated cycling option
to Maps

572
00:22:39,02 --> 00:22:44,09
which allows users to ride their bike
along bike lanes, paths and roads.

573
00:22:39,02 --> 00:22:44,09
which allows users to ride their bike
along bike lanes, paths and roads.

574
00:22:44,49 --> 00:22:46,33
Maps takes elevation into account

575
00:22:46,40 --> 00:22:49,33
to let you know if you're in for
a challenging uphill workout

576
00:22:46,40 --> 00:22:49,33
to let you know if you're in for
a challenging uphill workout

577
00:22:49,77 --> 00:22:51,63
or a leisurely flat ride.

578
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:55,80
You can also see if your route
includes quiet or busy roads.

579
00:22:52,00 --> 00:22:55,80
You can also see if your route
includes quiet or busy roads.

580
00:22:56,17 --> 00:22:59,27
We'll even let you know
if you have a steep passage coming up

581
00:22:59,34 --> 00:23:01,54
or if you'll need to carry your bike
up the stairs.

582
00:22:59,34 --> 00:23:01,54
or if you'll need to carry your bike
up the stairs.

583
00:23:02,18 --> 00:23:05,45
You can also choose
to avoid stairs altogether.

584
00:23:06,35 --> 00:23:09,69
With iOS 14, we're bringing cycling
to New York City, LA,

585
00:23:09,75 --> 00:23:11,25
the San Francisco Bay Area,

586
00:23:11,32 --> 00:23:14,72
along with a number of cities in China
like Shanghai and Beijing.

587
00:23:11,32 --> 00:23:14,72
along with a number of cities in China
like Shanghai and Beijing.

588
00:23:15,19 --> 00:23:18,63
And we'll be adding many more cities
in the coming months.

589
00:23:15,19 --> 00:23:18,63
And we'll be adding many more cities
in the coming months.

590
00:23:19,09 --> 00:23:23,97
For environmentally conscious drivers,
we're also introducing EV routing.

591
00:23:25,00 --> 00:23:26,57
If you have an electric car,

592
00:23:26,64 --> 00:23:30,24
Maps is going to help eliminate
range anxiety.

00:23:26,64 --> 00:23:30,24
Maps is going to help eliminate
range anxiety.

594
00:23:30,31 --> 00:23:33,98
With iOS 14,
Maps will track your current charge

595
00:23:34,04 --> 00:23:36,91
and factor in things
like elevation and weather

596
00:23:34,04 --> 00:23:36,91
and factor in things
like elevation and weather

597
00:23:36,98 --> 00:23:40,62
to automatically add charging stops
along your route.

598
00:23:40,68 --> 00:23:44,12
And Maps will know
which type of charger works for your car,

599
00:23:40,68 --> 00:23:44,12
And Maps will know
which type of charger works for your car,

600
00:23:44,19 --> 00:23:47,39
making sure to only route you
to compatible stations.

601
00:23:47,86 --> 00:23:49,89
We're working with a number
of manufacturers

602
00:23:47,86 --> 00:23:49,89
We're working with a number
of manufacturers

603
00:23:49,96 --> 00:23:52,39
to support EV routing in their vehicles,

604
00:23:52,46 --> 00:23:54,36
including BMW and Ford,

605
00:23:52,46 --> 00:23:54,36
including BMW and Ford,

606
00:23:54,43 --> 00:23:57,20
and we'll be adding many more
in the near future.

607
00:23:57,27 --> 00:24:02,77
Cities around the world are also working
to improve air quality and reduce traffic,

608
00:23:57,27 --> 00:24:02,77
Cities around the world are also working
to improve air quality and reduce traffic,

609
00:24:02,84 --> 00:24:06,21
so we're adding
congestion and green zones to Maps

610
00:24:02,84 --> 00:24:06,21
so we're adding
congestion and green zones to Maps

611
00:24:06,28 --> 00:24:10,61
to easily see where they are
along with alternate routing options.

612
00:24:11,18 --> 00:24:12,88
In addition, drivers in China

613
00:24:11,18 --> 00:24:12,88
In addition, drivers in China

614
00:24:12,95 --> 00:24:16,35
can securely store their
license plate number on their iPhone,

615
00:24:16,42 --> 00:24:20,16
and Maps will let them know which days
they can enter congested city centers

616
00:24:16,42 --> 00:24:20,16
and Maps will let them know which days
they can enter congested city centers

617
00:24:20,22 --> 00:24:21,82
based on that number.

618
00:24:21,89 --> 00:24:24,63
And those are just some
of the great new features

619
00:24:21,89 --> 00:24:24,63
And those are just some
of the great new features

620
00:24:24,69 --> 00:24:27,20
coming to Apple Maps in iOS 14,

621
00:24:27,26 --> 00:24:29,73
making Maps the best product

622
00:24:29,80 --> 00:24:32,84
to help users explore
and navigate their world.

And now, on to CarPlay,

627
00:24:37,67 --> 00:24:40,34
which has transformed
the driving experience for iPhone owners

by being the smarter, safer way
to use the apps you love in your car.

CarPlay is everywhere,
and it's incredibly popular.

631

CarPlay is everywhere,
and it's incredibly popular.

632
00:24:48,28 --> 00:24:51,79
Here in the US,
it's available on basically every new car.

633
00:24:51,85 --> 00:24:55,89
And worldwide, it's available
on over 80% of new cars sold

634
00:24:51,85 --> 00:24:55,89
And worldwide, it's available
on over 80% of new cars sold

635
00:24:55,96 --> 00:24:59,96
and has quickly become the default
in-car experience for so many people.

636
00:25:00,03 --> 00:25:04,33
People love CarPlay, and we get
some really passionate reactions.

637
00:25:04,40 --> 00:25:07,67
Joanna Stern says
it makes her life "infinitely better."

parking, EV charging
and quick food ordering.

645
00:25:22,48 --> 00:25:25,42
In addition to this,
we're really excited for the next step

646
00:25:22,48 --> 00:25:25,42
In addition to this,
we're really excited for the next step

647
00:25:25,49 --> 00:25:28,12
in how we're transforming
your relationship with your car

648
00:25:28,19 --> 00:25:30,36
by rethinking car keys.

649
00:25:28,19 --> 00:25:30,36
by rethinking car keys.

650
00:25:30,43 --> 00:25:32,13
They've been around
for over a hundred years,

651
00:25:32,19 --> 00:25:36,40
but they've become big, bulky
and ripe for reimagining.

652
00:25:32,19 --> 00:25:36,40
but they've become big, bulky
and ripe for reimagining.

653
00:25:36,47 --> 00:25:38,70
To tell you more about
what we have planned,

654
00:25:38,77 --> 00:25:41,27
let's go to the garage
with Emily Schubert.

655
00:25:42,70 --> 00:25:43,77
Thanks, Craig.

656
00:25:43,84 --> 00:25:46,91
I'm excited to introduce
a digital version of car keys.

657
00:25:46,98 --> 00:25:49,31
Now you can leave your keys at home

658
00:25:46,98 --> 00:25:49,31
Now you can leave your keys at home

659
00:25:49,38 --> 00:25:51,85
and unlock and start your car
with your iPhone.

660
00:25:51,91 --> 00:25:57,12
And the very first car to support this
will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series.

661
00:25:51,91 --> 00:25:57,12
And the very first car to support this
will be the new 2021 BMW 5 Series.

662
00:25:57,19 --> 00:25:58,55
Let me show you how it works.

663
00:25:58,62 --> 00:26:00,06
It's super simple.

664
00:25:58,62 --> 00:26:00,06
It's super simple.

665
00:26:00,12 --> 00:26:02,59
-It uses NFC, and you just tap to unlock.

But this goes beyond just one less thing

Digital keys have security benefits.

00:26:15,30 --> 00:26:18,17
They live in the Secure Element
of your iPhone,

They live in the Secure Element
of your iPhone,

674
00:26:18,24 --> 00:26:22,71
and if it goes missing, you can turn off
your keys remotely via iCloud.

675
00:26:23,31 --> 00:26:25,78
They're even easier to share
than a physical key.

676
00:26:23,31 --> 00:26:25,78
They're even easier to share
than a physical key.

677
00:26:25,85 --> 00:26:28,65
Copies don't involve
trips to the dealership.

678
00:26:28,72 --> 00:26:32,02
And you can share
from wherever you are with iMessage.

With each key you share,
you can set options,

like a restricted driving profile,
perfect for teen drivers.

The new BMW will be available
to customers next month.

693
00:27:00,82 --> 00:27:03,25
In addition to adding this feature
to iOS 14,

694
00:27:03,32 --> 00:27:05,49
we're also enabling it in iOS 13,

695
00:27:05,55 --> 00:27:08,59
so customers can use their car keys
even sooner.

696
00:27:05,55 --> 00:27:08,59
so customers can use their car keys
even sooner.

697
00:27:09,12 --> 00:27:11,99
Of course,
we want this to work in any car,

698
00:27:12,06 --> 00:27:14,76
so we've been working on standards
with industry groups.

699
00:27:14,83 --> 00:27:16,67
And this is just the beginning.

700
00:27:16,73 --> 00:27:19,80
We're working on technology
that will leverage our U1 chip,

701
00:27:16,73 --> 00:27:19,80
We're working on technology
that will leverage our U1 chip,

702
00:27:19,87 --> 00:27:24,57
which uses Ultra Wideband technology
for precise spatial awareness.

703
00:27:19,87 --> 00:27:24,57
which uses Ultra Wideband technology
for precise spatial awareness.

704
00:27:24,64 --> 00:27:27,31
So you'll be able to leave your iPhone
in your bag or pocket

705
00:27:27,38 --> 00:27:30,55
and still securely
unlock and start your car.

706
00:27:27,38 --> 00:27:30,55
and still securely
unlock and start your car.

707
00:27:30,61 --> 00:27:34,78
We expect to see support for this standard
starting in new cars next year.

708
00:27:35,35 --> 00:27:38,22
Now, let's turn to the App Store.

709
00:27:35,35 --> 00:27:38,22
Now, let's turn to the App Store.

710
00:27:38,29 --> 00:27:39,42
Twelve years ago,

711
00:27:39,49 --> 00:27:42,86
we revolutionized the industry
with the launch of the App Store.

712
00:27:39,49 --> 00:27:42,86
we revolutionized the industry
with the launch of the App Store.

713
00:27:42,93 --> 00:27:47,86
Today we have so many amazing apps
that offer a rich set of experiences,

714
00:27:47,93 --> 00:27:51,07
we can truly say
that for everything we want to do,

715
00:27:47,93 --> 00:27:51,07
we can truly say
that for everything we want to do,

716
00:27:51,13 --> 00:27:53,27
"There's an app for that."

717
00:27:53,34 --> 00:27:56,57
So now it's time for us to extend
the success of the App Store

718
00:27:53,34 --> 00:27:56,57
So now it's time for us to extend
the success of the App Store

719
00:27:56,64 --> 00:27:59,68
and make apps available and accessible
in whole new ways.

720
00:28:00,21 --> 00:28:03,91
What if you could have the right app
you needed at just the right moment?

00:28:03,98 --> 00:28:06,65
Let's look at what it would be like
if you did.

750
00:29:00,94 --> 00:29:03,74
An App Clip is a small part of an app.

751
00:29:03,81 --> 00:29:06,34
It's light and fast and easy to discover,

752
00:29:03,81 --> 00:29:06,34
It's light and fast and easy to discover,

753
00:29:06,41 --> 00:29:09,01
so you can quickly get what you need
right when you need it.

754
00:29:09,91 --> 00:29:13,25
Everything about App Clips
is designed for speed.

755
00:29:09,91 --> 00:29:13,25
Everything about App Clips
is designed for speed.

756
00:29:13,32 --> 00:29:16,22
They start with this card
which quickly pops up.

757
00:29:16,29 --> 00:29:19,32
And with just a tap,
you can launch the App Clip.

758
00:29:16,29 --> 00:29:19,32
And with just a tap,
you can launch the App Clip.

759
00:29:19,39 --> 00:29:21,42
You don't need to enter
credit card numbers

760
00:29:21,49 --> 00:29:24,36
because App Clips
can use Apple Pay for payments.

761
00:29:21,49 --> 00:29:24,36
because App Clips
can use Apple Pay for payments.

762
00:29:24,43 --> 00:29:27,10
And you don't have to manually
log into an account

763
00:29:27,16 --> 00:29:29,83
because it can take advantage
of Sign in with Apple.

764
00:29:30,50 --> 00:29:32,87
App Clips won't clutter your Home Screen

765
00:29:32,94 --> 00:29:35,60
and will only stay along
as long as you need them.

766
00:29:35,67 --> 00:29:40,51
But you can easily launch recently used
App Clips from the new App Library.

767
00:29:35,67 --> 00:29:40,51
But you can easily launch recently used
App Clips from the new App Library.

768
00:29:40,58 --> 00:29:42,85
It's always easy to download the full app,

769
00:29:40,58 --> 00:29:42,85
It's always easy to download the full app,

770
00:29:42,91 --> 00:29:45,75
and this makes App Clips
an easy way to discover

771
00:29:45,81 --> 00:29:48,55
more of what the App Store has to offer.

772
00:29:45,81 --> 00:29:48,55
more of what the App Store has to offer.

773
00:29:48,62 --> 00:29:50,55
And discovery is key.

774
00:29:50,62 --> 00:29:54,46
App Clips are all about getting to a part
of an app at the moment you need it,

775
00:29:50,62 --> 00:29:54,46
App Clips are all about getting to a part
of an app at the moment you need it,

776
00:29:54,52 --> 00:29:57,49
so it was critical that we made them
really easy to find.

777
00:29:58,13 --> 00:30:01,33
App Clips can be easily discovered
and launched from the web.

778
00:29:58,13 --> 00:30:01,33
App Clips can be easily discovered
and launched from the web.

779
00:30:01,40 --> 00:30:04,43
You can launch App Clips from Messages
when friends share them with you.

00:30:04,50 --> 00:30:07,07
When you want to order takeout
from a restaurant in Maps,

00:30:04,50 --> 00:30:07,07
When you want to order takeout
from a restaurant in Maps,

782
00:30:07,14 --> 00:30:10,11
you can launch an App Clip
right from a place card.

783
00:30:10,17 --> 00:30:14,51
You'll be able to tap on NFC tags out in
the world, on things like parking meters.

784
00:30:10,17 --> 00:30:14,51
You'll be able to tap on NFC tags out in
the world, on things like parking meters.

785
00:30:14,58 --> 00:30:16,31
Or you can scan QR codes

786
00:30:16,38 --> 00:30:19,21
to launch App Clips
that work with products you purchase.

787
00:30:16,38 --> 00:30:19,21
to launch App Clips
that work with products you purchase.

788
00:30:19,28 --> 00:30:24,19
The best way to discover App Clips will be
with the new Apple-designed App Clip code.

789
00:30:19,28 --> 00:30:24,19
The best way to discover App Clips will be
with the new Apple-designed App Clip code.

790
00:30:24,25 --> 00:30:28,29
So when you see one, you'll know
that there's an App Clip waiting for you.

791
00:30:28,36 --> 00:30:31,43
They incorporate
both a visual code and NFC,

792
00:30:28,36 --> 00:30:31,43
They incorporate
both a visual code and NFC,

793
00:30:31,49 --> 00:30:36,10
so you tap on them or scan them with
the camera to bring up an App Clip.

794
00:30:31,49 --> 00:30:36,10
so you tap on them or scan them with
the camera to bring up an App Clip.

795
00:30:36,17 --> 00:30:39,80
App Clips will be great for businesses
that already have apps.

796
00:30:39,87 --> 00:30:42,54
But we want to be able
to use App Clips everywhere,

797
00:30:39,87 --> 00:30:42,54
But we want to be able
to use App Clips everywhere,

798
00:30:42,60 --> 00:30:46,38
including smaller spots
that may not have their own app.

799
00:30:46,44 --> 00:30:50,28
So we made it possible for apps like Yelp,
which support multiple businesses,

800
00:30:46,44 --> 00:30:50,28
So we made it possible for apps like Yelp,
which support multiple businesses,

801
00:30:50,35 --> 00:30:54,68
to create App Clip experiences
for each of the places they work with.

802
00:30:50,35 --> 00:30:54,68
to create App Clip experiences
for each of the places they work with.

803
00:30:54,75 --> 00:30:57,55
Developers will create App Clips
from a part of an app,

804
00:30:57,62 --> 00:31:00,62
using Xcode and the full power of the SDK.

805
00:30:57,62 --> 00:31:00,62
using Xcode and the full power of the SDK.

806
00:31:01,02 --> 00:31:02,42
To ensure that they launch quickly,

807
00:31:02,49 --> 00:31:05,63
they'll need to be
less than 10 megabytes in size.

808
00:31:05,69 --> 00:31:07,90
And that's App Clips.

809
00:31:05,69 --> 00:31:07,90
And that's App Clips.

810
00:31:07,96 --> 00:31:09,67
Immediately discoverable,

811
00:31:09,73 --> 00:31:11,87
small in size, so they launch fast,

and the option to download the full app
from the App Store

and the option to download the full app
from the App Store

817
00:31:20,51 --> 00:31:22,04
when you want to keep it around.

We can't wait to see all the App Clips
developers will create.

819
00:31:22,11 --> 00:31:25,88
We can't wait to see all the App Clips
developers will create.

820
00:31:25,95 --> 00:31:28,38
And that's iOS 14.

821
00:31:28,45 --> 00:31:32,52
It's a huge release that transforms
the core experience of iPhone,

00:32:55,40 --> 00:32:59,54
that take great advantage
of the iPad's large, multi-touch display.

859
00:32:59,61 --> 00:33:02,11
Now iPad has always been about the apps.

860
00:32:59,61 --> 00:33:02,11
Now iPad has always been about the apps.

861
00:33:02,18 --> 00:33:05,91
In the beginning, we focused on
giving the ecosystem of iPhone apps

862
00:33:05,98 --> 00:33:09,72
a larger canvas
to deliver new and unique experiences.

863
00:33:05,98 --> 00:33:09,72
a larger canvas
to deliver new and unique experiences.

864
00:33:09,79 --> 00:33:12,99
This quickly sparked
an entirely new set of apps,

865
00:33:09,79 --> 00:33:12,99
This quickly sparked
an entirely new set of apps,

866
00:33:13,06 --> 00:33:14,59
designed for iPad first,

867
00:33:14,66 --> 00:33:16,29
with immersive experiences

868
00:33:16,36 --> 00:33:18,66
that transform this magical sheet of glass

869
00:33:16,36 --> 00:33:18,66
that transform this magical sheet of glass

870
00:33:18,73 --> 00:33:20,33
into whatever you needed it to be.

871
00:33:20,83 --> 00:33:24,13
We're proud of the over one million apps
on the App Store today

872
00:33:20,83 --> 00:33:24,13
We're proud of the over one million apps
on the App Store today

873
00:33:24,20 --> 00:33:26,87
designed just for iPad.

874
00:33:26,94 --> 00:33:30,54
With customers continuing to push
their iPads further than ever before,

875
00:33:26,94 --> 00:33:30,54
With customers continuing to push
their iPads further than ever before,

876
00:33:30,61 --> 00:33:32,74
we're extending
the design language of iPad

877
00:33:32,81 --> 00:33:36,41
to make apps more streamlined
and more powerful.

878
00:33:32,81 --> 00:33:36,41
to make apps more streamlined
and more powerful.

879
00:33:37,15 --> 00:33:39,28
To give you a live look
at these enhancements,

880
00:33:39,35 --> 00:33:41,72
I'll hand it over to Josh Shaffer.

881
00:33:42,05 --> 00:33:43,09
Thanks, Craig.

882
00:33:43,52 --> 00:33:45,82
Let's take a look at
some of the enhancements to iPadOS.

883
00:33:45,89 --> 00:33:47,59
The first thing that you'll notice

884
00:33:47,66 --> 00:33:50,89
are the same redesigned widgets
that you saw in iOS 14.

885
00:33:47,66 --> 00:33:50,89
are the same redesigned widgets
that you saw in iOS 14.

886
00:33:51,29 --> 00:33:53,33
They look great on iPad as well,

887
00:33:53,40 --> 00:33:56,60
and they give you information at a glance
whenever you go Home.

888
00:33:53,40 --> 00:33:56,60
and they give you information at a glance
whenever you go Home.

889
00:33:57,17 --> 00:34:00,47
But let's see some of the improvements
in the apps, starting with Photos.

890
00:33:57,17 --> 00:34:00,47
But let's see some of the improvements
in the apps, starting with Photos.

891
00:34:01,04 --> 00:34:03,81
iPad is the perfect device
for browsing your photos.

892
00:34:04,21 --> 00:34:07,81
Its large canvas lets you immerse yourself
in all your favorite memories.

893
00:34:04,21 --> 00:34:07,81
Its large canvas lets you immerse yourself
in all your favorite memories.

894
00:34:07,88 --> 00:34:11,91
And this year, we're making it even easier
to browse and organize your photos

895
00:34:11,98 --> 00:34:13,38
with an all-new sidebar.

896
00:34:11,98 --> 00:34:13,38
with an all-new sidebar.

897
00:34:13,95 --> 00:34:17,02
With just a tap of this button,
I can reveal the sidebar,

898
00:34:17,09 --> 00:34:20,39
with all the core functionality of the app
in a single location.

899
00:34:17,09 --> 00:34:20,39
with all the core functionality of the app
in a single location.

900
00:34:21,12 --> 00:34:23,39
My photos remain front and center,

901
00:34:23,46 --> 00:34:26,56
but now I can quickly tap to move
between parts of the app.

902
00:34:23,46 --> 00:34:26,56
but now I can quickly tap to move
between parts of the app.

903
00:34:26,96 --> 00:34:30,70
The sidebar is a really powerful way
to organize your photos too.

904
00:34:26,96 --> 00:34:30,70
The sidebar is a really powerful way
to organize your photos too.

905
00:34:30,77 --> 00:34:33,23
I can easily drag a photo to the sidebar

906
00:34:33,60 --> 00:34:36,00
and then just drop it
to add it to an album.

907
00:34:33,60 --> 00:34:36,00
and then just drop it
to add it to an album.

908
00:34:36,07 --> 00:34:39,34
We've brought this sidebar to many apps
across iPadOS.

909
00:34:39,74 --> 00:34:40,74
Like Notes,

910
00:34:40,81 --> 00:34:44,05
where it provides quick and easy access
to all your folders.

911
00:34:40,81 --> 00:34:44,05
where it provides quick and easy access
to all your folders.

912
00:34:44,61 --> 00:34:48,78
And Files, where we've consolidated
navigation into the sidebar

913
00:34:44,61 --> 00:34:48,78
And Files, where we've consolidated
navigation into the sidebar

914
00:34:48,85 --> 00:34:50,75
for a streamlined new design.

915
00:34:50,82 --> 00:34:52,89
We've also streamlined the toolbars,

916
00:34:52,96 --> 00:34:55,86
adding new drop-down menus
that consolidate functions

917
00:34:52,96 --> 00:34:55,86
adding new drop-down menus
that consolidate functions

918
00:34:55,92 --> 00:34:57,79
into a single, easy-to-access button.

919
00:34:58,46 --> 00:35:01,06
I can just tap to change views like this.

920
00:34:58,46 --> 00:35:01,06
I can just tap to change views like this.

921
00:35:01,13 --> 00:35:02,83
And for even quicker access,

922
00:35:02,90 --> 00:35:06,97
I can just tap and drag to change
the sort order, all in a single motion.

923
00:35:02,90 --> 00:35:06,97
I can just tap and drag to change
the sort order, all in a single motion.

924
00:35:07,67 --> 00:35:11,07
You'll find this same approach
across other apps, like Calendar,

925
00:35:11,41 --> 00:35:14,31
where we've brought controls
into a single toolbar at the top,

926
00:35:11,41 --> 00:35:14,31
where we've brought controls
into a single toolbar at the top,

927
00:35:14,74 --> 00:35:16,68
providing more space for your content

928
00:35:16,75 --> 00:35:20,75
and a single unified place to access
all the app's functionality.

929
00:35:16,75 --> 00:35:20,75
and a single unified place to access
all the app's functionality.

930
00:35:20,82 --> 00:35:23,32
Finally, Music has been updated

931
00:35:23,39 --> 00:35:26,36
to take even better advantage
of iPad's large screen.

932
00:35:23,39 --> 00:35:26,36
to take even better advantage
of iPad's large screen.

933
00:35:26,82 --> 00:35:29,69
The sidebar in Music makes it easy
to move between views.

934
00:35:30,23 --> 00:35:34,06
I can quickly jump between
the new Listen Now and my playlists.

935
00:35:34,40 --> 00:35:36,27
-And once I start playing a song...
-["Caution" by The Killers playing]

936
00:35:34,40 --> 00:35:36,27
-And once I start playing a song...
-["Caution" by The Killers playing]

937
00:35:36,33 --> 00:35:39,00
...I can bring up the brand-new
full-screen player,

938
00:35:39,07 --> 00:35:42,50
where I can see rich album art,
transport controls and lyrics,

939
00:35:39,07 --> 00:35:42,50
where I can see rich album art,
transport controls and lyrics,

940
00:35:42,57 --> 00:35:44,37
-all in one single view.
-[song fades]

941
00:35:44,44 --> 00:35:46,18
And these are just
some of the enhancements

942
00:35:46,24 --> 00:35:48,41
that are coming to apps in iPadOS.

943
00:35:46,24 --> 00:35:48,41
that are coming to apps in iPadOS.

944
00:35:49,04 --> 00:35:51,31
We're really loving these new app designs.

945
00:35:51,38 --> 00:35:52,55
But there's more,

946
00:35:52,61 --> 00:35:54,25
starting with Siri.

947
00:35:52,61 --> 00:35:54,25
starting with Siri.

948
00:35:54,68 --> 00:35:57,69
The new compact Siri design
that you heard about in iOS 14

949
00:35:57,75 --> 00:36:00,09
is especially useful on iPad.

950
00:35:57,75 --> 00:36:00,09
is especially useful on iPad.

951
00:36:00,46 --> 00:36:02,19
Results appear at the bottom right corner,

952
00:36:02,26 --> 00:36:05,63
allowing you to easily reference the app
while using Siri.

953
00:36:05,69 --> 00:36:08,80
And we applied this same approach
to other parts of the experience...

954
00:36:05,69 --> 00:36:08,80
And we applied this same approach
to other parts of the experience...

955
00:36:10,63 --> 00:36:11,63
like calls.

956
00:36:11,70 --> 00:36:15,00
Now today when you receive a call
on iPad, you see this.

957
00:36:11,70 --> 00:36:15,00
Now today when you receive a call
on iPad, you see this.

958
00:36:15,07 --> 00:36:16,07
[beeps]

959
00:36:16,14 --> 00:36:18,64
Whatever you were working on
is suddenly completely covered

960
00:36:16,14 --> 00:36:18,64
Whatever you were working on
is suddenly completely covered

961
00:36:18,71 --> 00:36:20,54
with the incoming call screen.

962
00:36:20,61 --> 00:36:21,74
Not cool.

963
00:36:21,81 --> 00:36:24,05
Wouldn't it be nicer
if instead you saw this?

964
00:36:21,81 --> 00:36:24,05
Wouldn't it be nicer
if instead you saw this?

965
00:36:24,11 --> 00:36:25,28
[beeps]

966
00:36:25,35 --> 00:36:26,55
Well, that's much better.

967
00:36:27,02 --> 00:36:30,02
Now an incoming call is presented
with a compact notification

968
00:36:27,02 --> 00:36:30,02
Now an incoming call is presented
with a compact notification

969
00:36:30,09 --> 00:36:32,29
that doesn't take you out of context.

970
00:36:32,86 --> 00:36:36,43
And you can simply tap to answer
or flick it away to dismiss.

971
00:36:32,86 --> 00:36:36,43
And you can simply tap to answer
or flick it away to dismiss.

972
00:36:36,99 --> 00:36:39,90
And this applies to all calls,
including those from your iPhone

973
00:36:39,96 --> 00:36:42,03
or third-party VoIP apps like Skype.

974
00:36:39,96 --> 00:36:42,03
or third-party VoIP apps like Skype.

975
00:36:42,10 --> 00:36:43,17
[rings]

976
00:36:43,23 --> 00:36:46,47
And of course we're bringing this
to iOS as well.

977
00:36:46,54 --> 00:36:49,30
We think our iPhone customers
are going to love it.

978
00:36:46,54 --> 00:36:49,30
We think our iPhone customers
are going to love it.

979
00:36:49,37 --> 00:36:53,04
Now there's one more key experience
we've redesigned for iPad this year,

980
00:36:53,68 --> 00:36:55,31
and that's Search.

981
00:36:53,68 --> 00:36:55,31
and that's Search.

982
00:36:55,38 --> 00:36:57,98
Today Search is a full-screen experience,

983
00:36:58,05 --> 00:37:00,85
and sometimes you can lose track
of your context.

984
00:36:58,05 --> 00:37:00,85
and sometimes you can lose track
of your context.

985
00:37:00,92 --> 00:37:04,05
So we've redesigned Search
with a new, compact design.

986
00:37:04,12 --> 00:37:07,12
You can start a search from anywhere,
like the Home Screen

987
00:37:04,12 --> 00:37:07,12
You can start a search from anywhere,
like the Home Screen

988
00:37:07,19 --> 00:37:08,96
or over any app.

989
00:37:09,02 --> 00:37:10,96
And this makes it easy
to find what you need

990
00:37:11,03 --> 00:37:13,63
without feeling like you've left the app
you're working in.

991
00:37:11,03 --> 00:37:13,63
without feeling like you've left the app
you're working in.

992
00:37:14,03 --> 00:37:15,73
But we didn't just redesign it.

993
00:37:15,80 --> 00:37:20,44
We've rebuilt Search from the ground up
to be Universal,

994
00:37:15,80 --> 00:37:20,44
We've rebuilt Search from the ground up
to be Universal,

995
00:37:20,50 --> 00:37:24,31
becoming a single destination
where you can start all of your searches.

996
00:37:20,50 --> 00:37:24,31
becoming a single destination
where you can start all of your searches.

997
00:37:24,64 --> 00:37:27,18
First, we made it better than ever
as an app launcher.

998
00:37:27,24 --> 00:37:29,21
You just start typing a few characters,

999
00:37:29,28 --> 00:37:31,85
and you can instantly get
to where you're going.

1000
00:37:29,28 --> 00:37:31,85
and you can instantly get
to where you're going.

1001
00:37:31,91 --> 00:37:35,62
It's also great for finding contacts
to message or call

1002
00:37:35,68 --> 00:37:36,89
or documents.

1003
00:37:35,68 --> 00:37:36,89
or documents.

1004
00:37:36,95 --> 00:37:42,09
You can even search directly into apps
like Keynote, Messages, Mail or Files.

1005
00:37:36,95 --> 00:37:42,09
You can even search directly into apps
like Keynote, Messages, Mail or Files.

1006
00:37:42,16 --> 00:37:44,49
Or look up information
about people or places.

1007
00:37:44,96 --> 00:37:48,96
And it's also a great place to start
all of your web searches as well.

1008
00:37:44,96 --> 00:37:48,96
And it's also a great place to start
all of your web searches as well.

1009
00:37:49,03 --> 00:37:50,30
As soon as you start typing,

1010
00:37:50,37 --> 00:37:52,84
you get relevant suggestions
to complete your search.

1011
00:37:52,90 --> 00:37:56,17
And you can get to your web search results
with just a tap.

1012
00:37:52,90 --> 00:37:56,17
And you can get to your web search results
with just a tap.

1013
00:37:56,24 --> 00:37:59,21
And Search now makes navigating
to your favorite websites

1014
00:37:59,27 --> 00:38:01,84
just as easy as launching an app.

1015
00:37:59,27 --> 00:38:01,84
just as easy as launching an app.

1016
00:38:01,91 --> 00:38:05,68
Just type a few letters and the top hit
will take you right to Safari.

1017
00:38:07,08 --> 00:38:10,45
So those are some of our updates
to the iPad experience.

1018
00:38:10,52 --> 00:38:12,29
And of course,
you also get the new widgets

1019
00:38:10,52 --> 00:38:12,29
And of course,
you also get the new widgets

1020
00:38:12,35 --> 00:38:15,72
and all the other great app enhancements
from iOS 14.

1021
00:38:16,86 --> 00:38:21,10
Next, we want to push forward your ability
to express yourself creatively

1022
00:38:16,86 --> 00:38:21,10
Next, we want to push forward your ability
to express yourself creatively

1023
00:38:21,16 --> 00:38:23,73
with improvements to Apple Pencil.

1024
00:38:24,93 --> 00:38:27,07
Apple Pencil is a game-changing tool

1025
00:38:27,14 --> 00:38:29,91
that turns iPad into
a professional drawing canvas,

1026
00:38:29,97 --> 00:38:32,61
a great way to mark up and sign documents

1027
00:38:29,97 --> 00:38:32,61
a great way to mark up and sign documents

1028
00:38:32,67 --> 00:38:35,24
and the ultimate note-taking device.

1029
00:38:35,31 --> 00:38:38,85
What many people love most
about taking notes with Apple Pencil

1030
00:38:35,31 --> 00:38:38,85
What many people love most
about taking notes with Apple Pencil

1031
00:38:38,91 --> 00:38:41,88
is how they can express themselves
in a free-form way.

1032
00:38:41,95 --> 00:38:45,55
Mixing handwriting and drawings can be
the best way to capture your thoughts.

1033
00:38:41,95 --> 00:38:45,55
Mixing handwriting and drawings can be
the best way to capture your thoughts.

1034
00:38:45,62 --> 00:38:48,92
Now the challenge is
when you want to change things afterwards.

1035
00:38:45,62 --> 00:38:48,92
Now the challenge is
when you want to change things afterwards.

1036
00:38:48,99 --> 00:38:53,06
Here, working with handwriting
just isn't as easy as with typed text.

1037
00:38:53,13 --> 00:38:55,26
Now, we sometimes take it for granted,

1038
00:38:53,13 --> 00:38:55,26
Now, we sometimes take it for granted,

1039
00:38:55,33 --> 00:38:57,97
but with typed text
it's so easy to select,

1040
00:38:58,03 --> 00:39:00,00
copy and paste into another document,

1041
00:38:58,03 --> 00:39:00,00
copy and paste into another document,

1042
00:39:00,07 --> 00:39:02,84
or even just make space for more text.

1043
00:39:02,91 --> 00:39:06,74
Well, this year, we're going to make
handwriting just as easy

1044
00:39:02,91 --> 00:39:06,74
Well, this year, we're going to make
handwriting just as easy

1045
00:39:06,81 --> 00:39:08,34
and just as powerful.

1046
00:39:08,41 --> 00:39:09,75
But that's not all.

1047
00:39:09,81 --> 00:39:13,32
Our customers tell us that once they have
an Apple Pencil in their hand,

1048
00:39:09,81 --> 00:39:13,32
Our customers tell us that once they have
an Apple Pencil in their hand,

1049
00:39:13,38 --> 00:39:14,82
they don't want to put it away.

1050
00:39:14,88 --> 00:39:18,72
So this year,
we're bringing Scribble to iPad.

1051
00:39:14,88 --> 00:39:18,72
So this year,
we're bringing Scribble to iPad.

1052
00:39:19,22 --> 00:39:21,29
So you can handwrite into any text field,

1053
00:39:21,36 --> 00:39:23,86
and it will automatically
be converted to text.

1054
00:39:24,46 --> 00:39:26,30
To show you all of this in action,

1055
00:39:26,36 --> 00:39:29,36
I'd like to welcome Jenny Chen
for a live demo.

1056
00:39:29,63 --> 00:39:30,60
Thanks, Craig.

1057
00:39:29,63 --> 00:39:30,60
Thanks, Craig.

1058
00:39:30,67 --> 00:39:33,77
I'm really excited to show you
some great new features we have

1059
00:39:33,84 --> 00:39:36,21
for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year.

1060
00:39:33,84 --> 00:39:36,21
for Apple Pencil and iPadOS this year.

1061
00:39:36,27 --> 00:39:39,14
One of the great parts about taking notes
with the Apple Pencil

1062
00:39:39,21 --> 00:39:41,34
is that it really lets you work
in a free-form way.

1063
00:39:41,41 --> 00:39:43,28
I can just start writing anywhere.

1064
00:39:41,41 --> 00:39:43,28
I can just start writing anywhere.

1065
00:39:43,71 --> 00:39:45,85
And it's not just about text.

1066
00:39:45,91 --> 00:39:49,85
I can also express myself
with drawings or shapes.

1067
00:39:45,91 --> 00:39:49,85
I can also express myself
with drawings or shapes.

1068
00:39:49,92 --> 00:39:53,02
But sometimes you want that
more professional, cleaned-up look.

1069
00:39:53,09 --> 00:39:56,46
So now, when I draw a simple shape
and pause at the end,

1070
00:39:53,09 --> 00:39:56,46
So now, when I draw a simple shape
and pause at the end,

1071
00:39:56,53 --> 00:39:59,39
it'll automatically convert
to that ideal shape.

1072
00:39:59,93 --> 00:40:02,76
And we're smart about it,
retaining the same size

1073
00:39:59,93 --> 00:40:02,76
And we're smart about it,
retaining the same size

1074
00:40:03,53 --> 00:40:05,13
and angle that you drew it at.

1075
00:40:06,57 --> 00:40:07,80
In addition to shapes,

1076
00:40:07,87 --> 00:40:10,77
we've also made huge improvements
to our handwriting recognition.

1077
00:40:10,84 --> 00:40:13,74
So now, when I write,
I can easily make a selection

1078
00:40:10,84 --> 00:40:13,74
So now, when I write,
I can easily make a selection

1079
00:40:13,81 --> 00:40:16,35
using the same gestures
that I use for typed text.

1080
00:40:16,41 --> 00:40:20,42
I can double tap to select a word
or double tap again to select a line.

1081
00:40:16,41 --> 00:40:20,42
I can double tap to select a word
or double tap again to select a line.

1082
00:40:21,28 --> 00:40:24,02
Thanks to our advanced,
on-device machine learning,

1083
00:40:21,28 --> 00:40:24,02
Thanks to our advanced,
on-device machine learning,

1084
00:40:24,09 --> 00:40:26,15
you'll notice how we can
select the handwriting

1085
00:40:26,22 --> 00:40:28,56
while avoiding the drawings nearby.

1086
00:40:28,62 --> 00:40:29,93
Now that I have the selection,

1087
00:40:29,99 --> 00:40:33,43
I can easily change the color
or move it around the document.

1088
00:40:29,99 --> 00:40:33,43
I can easily change the color
or move it around the document.

1089
00:40:33,50 --> 00:40:37,43
It's also perfectly easy for me
to make space for more room to write.

1090
00:40:33,50 --> 00:40:37,43
It's also perfectly easy for me
to make space for more room to write.

1091
00:40:37,77 --> 00:40:41,14
We think that this will make note-taking
with the Apple Pencil even better.

1092
00:40:41,20 --> 00:40:45,14
Now, you don't even have to put it down
when you want to do something else.

1093
00:40:41,20 --> 00:40:45,14
Now, you don't even have to put it down
when you want to do something else.

1094
00:40:45,21 --> 00:40:48,08
Let's say you want to search
for "Edison bulbs" in Safari.

1095
00:40:45,21 --> 00:40:48,08
Let's say you want to search
for "Edison bulbs" in Safari.

1096
00:40:48,51 --> 00:40:51,55
Using Scribble, I can just write
directly into the text field...

1097
00:40:54,08 --> 00:40:56,75
and it automatically
gets converted to typed text.

1098
00:40:56,82 --> 00:40:59,35
It also works in any text field,

1099
00:40:59,42 --> 00:41:01,06
so I can easily add a new Reminder

1100
00:40:59,42 --> 00:41:01,06
so I can easily add a new Reminder

1101
00:41:01,12 --> 00:41:03,29
to my shared Reminders list
with my husband.

1102
00:41:05,93 --> 00:41:07,36
I've also been learning Chinese,

1103
00:41:05,93 --> 00:41:07,36
I've also been learning Chinese,

1104
00:41:07,43 --> 00:41:10,30
so I want to surprise him
with some of my progress and skills.

1105
00:41:10,77 --> 00:41:12,77
I'll use Scratch to delete "lights."

1106
00:41:10,77 --> 00:41:12,77
I'll use Scratch to delete "lights."

1107
00:41:12,84 --> 00:41:17,01
And then I can use Scribble to write "new"
and then "light fixture" in Chinese.

1108
00:41:18,21 --> 00:41:23,21
You'll notice how Scribble recognizes
both English and Chinese in the same line.

1109
00:41:23,81 --> 00:41:26,18
And what's awesome is that
we can build on this technology

1110
00:41:23,81 --> 00:41:26,18
And what's awesome is that
we can build on this technology

1111
00:41:26,25 --> 00:41:29,15
to deliver other great features,
like Data Detectors.

1112
00:41:29,22 --> 00:41:31,42
We can automatically detect
what you write,

1113
00:41:29,22 --> 00:41:31,42
We can automatically detect
what you write,

1114
00:41:31,49 --> 00:41:33,76
like phone numbers,
so I can make a phone call.

1115
00:41:34,22 --> 00:41:36,79
Or addresses, so I can look up directions.

1116
00:41:34,22 --> 00:41:36,79
Or addresses, so I can look up directions.

1117
00:41:37,56 --> 00:41:41,16
We can use these features together
to do even more with your handwriting.

1118
00:41:41,56 --> 00:41:44,43
Let's say I wanted to use my handwriting
in another app.

1119
00:41:41,56 --> 00:41:44,43
Let's say I wanted to use my handwriting
in another app.

1120
00:41:44,50 --> 00:41:46,17
I can easily select what I want,

1121
00:41:46,80 --> 00:41:49,10
tap the new Copy as Text
from the callout bar,

1122
00:41:46,80 --> 00:41:49,10
tap the new Copy as Text
from the callout bar,

1123
00:41:49,81 --> 00:41:52,24
and then paste it into an app like Pages.

1124
00:41:52,31 --> 00:41:54,91
And it's automatically converted
to typed text.

1125
00:41:52,31 --> 00:41:54,91
And it's automatically converted
to typed text.

1126
00:41:54,98 --> 00:41:57,95
We're really excited
about these awesome new features.

1127
00:41:58,01 --> 00:42:00,82
And we think it will let you do
even more with the Apple Pencil.

1128
00:41:58,01 --> 00:42:00,82
And we think it will let you do
even more with the Apple Pencil.

1129
00:42:01,55 --> 00:42:02,55
Thanks, Jenny.

1130
00:42:02,62 --> 00:42:04,59
So those are the enhancements to Pencil.

1131
00:42:04,65 --> 00:42:07,39
Just one part of an amazing release,

1132
00:42:04,65 --> 00:42:07,39
Just one part of an amazing release,

1133
00:42:07,46 --> 00:42:10,19
with Scribble for handwriting
into any text field,

1134
00:42:10,26 --> 00:42:12,90
a whole new way to work
with your handwritten notes,

1135
00:42:10,26 --> 00:42:12,90
a whole new way to work
with your handwritten notes,

1136
00:42:12,96 --> 00:42:15,73
broad enhancements to the app experience,

1137
00:42:15,80 --> 00:42:18,43
and of course, iPad users also benefit

1138
00:42:15,80 --> 00:42:18,43
and of course, iPad users also benefit

1139
00:42:18,50 --> 00:42:21,80
from the great features
you already saw in iOS 14

1140
00:42:21,87 --> 00:42:24,17
and much more that
we didn't have time to talk about.

1141
00:42:21,87 --> 00:42:24,17
and much more that
we didn't have time to talk about.

1142
00:42:24,71 --> 00:42:27,31
So that's iOS and iPadOS.

1143
00:42:27,38 --> 00:42:29,88
Next, let's talk about AirPods.

1144
00:42:30,41 --> 00:42:31,75
From the one-click setup

1145
00:42:31,81 --> 00:42:34,02
to the automatic pairing
with all your devices

1146
00:42:34,08 --> 00:42:36,22
to how they pause your audio
when you take them out,

1147
00:42:34,08 --> 00:42:36,22
to how they pause your audio
when you take them out,

1148
00:42:36,29 --> 00:42:39,66
people love the magical experience
that AirPods deliver.

1149
00:42:40,29 --> 00:42:43,43
Now we're bringing even more magic
to AirPods.

1150
00:42:40,29 --> 00:42:43,43
Now we're bringing even more magic
to AirPods.

1151
00:42:43,49 --> 00:42:47,13
To tell you all about it,
here's Mary-Ann Ionascu.

1152
00:42:47,53 --> 00:42:48,60
Thanks, Craig.

1153
00:42:47,53 --> 00:42:48,60
Thanks, Craig.

1154
00:42:48,66 --> 00:42:52,17
We have some amazing updates
coming to AirPods,

1155
00:42:52,23 --> 00:42:53,90
starting with Automatic Switching.

1156
00:42:54,40 --> 00:42:57,24
AirPods will now seamlessly move
between your devices

1157
00:42:57,31 --> 00:43:00,04
without you having
to manually switch them.

1158
00:42:57,31 --> 00:43:00,04
without you having
to manually switch them.

1159
00:43:00,11 --> 00:43:02,51
Let's say you just finished
listening to a podcast

1160
00:43:02,58 --> 00:43:05,18
and you pick up your iPad to watch a show.

1161
00:43:05,25 --> 00:43:07,78
AirPods will magically switch over.

1162
00:43:05,25 --> 00:43:07,78
AirPods will magically switch over.

1163
00:43:07,85 --> 00:43:10,45
And later you start a video conference
on your Mac.

1164
00:43:10,52 --> 00:43:13,52
AirPods will automatically switch again.

1165
00:43:10,52 --> 00:43:13,52
AirPods will automatically switch again.

1166
00:43:13,59 --> 00:43:15,19
-[ringing]
-And if a phone call comes in,

1167
00:43:15,26 --> 00:43:18,73
the audio in your AirPods
will route right back to your phone.

1168
00:43:15,26 --> 00:43:18,73
the audio in your AirPods
will route right back to your phone.

1169
00:43:18,79 --> 00:43:22,60
We also have an exciting new feature
coming to AirPods Pro:

1170
00:43:22,66 --> 00:43:24,77
spatial audio.

1171
00:43:22,66 --> 00:43:24,77
spatial audio.

1172
00:43:24,83 --> 00:43:27,47
You know the experience
of being in a movie theater

1173
00:43:27,54 --> 00:43:30,64
with a state-of-the-art
surround sound system,

1174
00:43:27,54 --> 00:43:30,64
with a state-of-the-art
surround sound system,

1175
00:43:30,71 --> 00:43:33,51
one where the sound
not only comes from in front of you...

1176
00:43:33,58 --> 00:43:35,68
-[tone pulsing]
-...but also from the left, the right,

1177
00:43:35,74 --> 00:43:37,98
behind, and even from above you?

1178
00:43:35,74 --> 00:43:37,98
behind, and even from above you?

1179
00:43:38,05 --> 00:43:43,45
Well, we are thrilled to bring that same
immersive experience to AirPods Pro.

1180
00:43:38,05 --> 00:43:43,45
Well, we are thrilled to bring that same
immersive experience to AirPods Pro.

1181
00:43:43,52 --> 00:43:45,52
But it turns out it's a lot harder to do

1182
00:43:45,59 --> 00:43:48,49
when you only have a single earbud
in each ear.

1183
00:43:45,59 --> 00:43:48,49
when you only have a single earbud
in each ear.

1184
00:43:48,56 --> 00:43:52,69
So our team created advanced
spatial audio algorithms for AirPods Pro

1185
00:43:52,76 --> 00:43:55,90
that replicate
the movie theater experience.

1186
00:43:52,76 --> 00:43:55,90
that replicate
the movie theater experience.

1187
00:43:55,96 --> 00:43:58,17
By applying directional audio filters

1188
00:43:58,23 --> 00:44:01,67
and subtly adjusting the frequencies
each ear receives,

1189
00:43:58,23 --> 00:44:01,67
and subtly adjusting the frequencies
each ear receives,

1190
00:44:01,74 --> 00:44:03,91
we can place sounds
virtually anywhere in space...

1191
00:44:03,97 --> 00:44:05,14
[high-speed vehicles passing]

1192
00:44:05,21 --> 00:44:08,04
...creating an immersive
surround sound experience.

1193
00:44:05,21 --> 00:44:08,04
...creating an immersive
surround sound experience.

1194
00:44:08,51 --> 00:44:13,25
But to truly deliver on this promise,
we had to factor in real-life situations.

1195
00:44:08,51 --> 00:44:13,25
But to truly deliver on this promise,
we had to factor in real-life situations.

1196
00:44:13,95 --> 00:44:16,32
First, people move their heads.

1197
00:44:16,39 --> 00:44:18,85
For an authentic
surround sound experience,

1198
00:44:16,39 --> 00:44:18,85
For an authentic
surround sound experience,

1199
00:44:18,92 --> 00:44:21,02
you need the sound field to stay fixed

1200
00:44:21,09 --> 00:44:23,53
so the voice feels like
it's coming from the actor

1201
00:44:23,59 --> 00:44:25,89
and not some random point in space.

1202
00:44:23,59 --> 00:44:25,89
and not some random point in space.

1203
00:44:25,96 --> 00:44:29,33
So we use the accelerometer
and gyroscopes in AirPods Pro

1204
00:44:29,40 --> 00:44:31,03
to track the motion of your head,

1205
00:44:29,40 --> 00:44:31,03
to track the motion of your head,

1206
00:44:31,57 --> 00:44:35,00
remapping the sound field
so it stays anchored to your device,

1207
00:44:35,07 --> 00:44:37,24
even as your head moves.

1208
00:44:35,07 --> 00:44:37,24
even as your head moves.

1209
00:44:37,31 --> 00:44:39,34
And it's not only your head that can move,

1210
00:44:39,41 --> 00:44:42,44
but you might move
your iPad or iPhone as well.

1211
00:44:39,41 --> 00:44:42,44
but you might move
your iPad or iPhone as well.

1212
00:44:42,51 --> 00:44:44,91
That's why we constantly compare
the motion data

1213
00:44:44,98 --> 00:44:47,22
from your head and your screen

1214
00:44:47,28 --> 00:44:50,72
to understand how they are moving
in relation to each other.

1215
00:44:47,28 --> 00:44:50,72
to understand how they are moving
in relation to each other.

1216
00:44:50,79 --> 00:44:53,96
So if your bus turns the corner
or your plane banks,

1217
00:44:54,02 --> 00:44:56,19
the sound stays in sync.

1218
00:44:56,26 --> 00:44:58,76
The result is a surround sound experience

1219
00:44:58,83 --> 00:45:01,40
that keeps you
in the middle of the action,

1220
00:44:58,83 --> 00:45:01,40
that keeps you
in the middle of the action,

1221
00:45:01,46 --> 00:45:02,73
no matter where you go.

1222
00:45:03,20 --> 00:45:08,24
Spatial audio for AirPods Pro will work
with content encoded in 5.1, 7.1,

1223
00:45:03,20 --> 00:45:08,24
Spatial audio for AirPods Pro will work
with content encoded in 5.1, 7.1,

1224
00:45:08,30 --> 00:45:09,84
and even Dolby Atmos.

1225
00:45:10,37 --> 00:45:11,54
Thanks, Mary-Ann.

1226
00:45:11,61 --> 00:45:13,68
I've been using the new spatial audio,

1227
00:45:11,61 --> 00:45:13,68
I've been using the new spatial audio,

1228
00:45:13,74 --> 00:45:16,04
and I think you're all
really gonna love it.

1229
00:45:16,11 --> 00:45:19,08
All right. Next let's head
to the Fitness Center

1230
00:45:16,11 --> 00:45:19,08
All right. Next let's head
to the Fitness Center

1231
00:45:19,15 --> 00:45:21,88
to hear the latest on watchOS from Kevin.

1236
00:45:36,90 --> 00:45:40,04
Thanks, Craig.
Since we launched Apple Watch,

1237
00:45:40,10 --> 00:45:42,37
it's completely redefined
what a watch can do,

1238
00:45:40,10 --> 00:45:42,37
it's completely redefined
what a watch can do,

1239
00:45:42,44 --> 00:45:44,31
and this has been
incredibly meaningful work.

1240
00:45:44,71 --> 00:45:47,48
Apple Watch not only helps you
stay connected and active,

1241
00:45:47,54 --> 00:45:49,78
it's become an intelligent guardian
of your health,

1242
00:45:47,54 --> 00:45:49,78
it's become an intelligent guardian
of your health,

1243
00:45:49,85 --> 00:45:54,52
enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls
and call emergency services for you.

1244
00:45:49,85 --> 00:45:54,52
enabling you to take an ECG, detect falls
and call emergency services for you.

1245
00:45:54,98 --> 00:45:58,09
It's impacting lives in ways
that were inconceivable five years ago.

1246
00:45:58,79 --> 00:46:01,69
The power of Apple Watch
is not only its built-in features,

1247
00:45:58,79 --> 00:46:01,69
The power of Apple Watch
is not only its built-in features,

1248
00:46:01,76 --> 00:46:03,99
but how developers
have personalized it for you.

1249
00:46:04,49 --> 00:46:06,90
We introduced the App Store in watchOS 6,

1250
00:46:04,49 --> 00:46:06,90
We introduced the App Store in watchOS 6,

1251
00:46:06,96 --> 00:46:10,17
and there are now over 20,000
watchOS apps available.

1252
00:46:10,23 --> 00:46:12,53
These apps bring the information
you care about most

1253
00:46:10,23 --> 00:46:12,53
These apps bring the information
you care about most

1254
00:46:12,60 --> 00:46:14,37
to just a glance at your watch face.

1255
00:46:14,44 --> 00:46:17,07
We're taking this even further
in watchOS 7,

1256
00:46:17,14 --> 00:46:19,01
starting with complications.

1257
00:46:17,14 --> 00:46:19,01
starting with complications.

1258
00:46:19,07 --> 00:46:23,35
Until today, an app could appear in only
one spot at a time on a watch face.

1259
00:46:23,41 --> 00:46:27,18
In watchOS 7 developers can
enable multiple complications,

1260
00:46:23,41 --> 00:46:27,18
In watchOS 7 developers can
enable multiple complications,

1261
00:46:27,25 --> 00:46:29,69
making even more richly personal
watch faces.

1262
00:46:30,49 --> 00:46:32,49
So if you like to use
Dawn Patrol for surfing,

1263
00:46:32,55 --> 00:46:34,16
you can create your own surf watch,

1264
00:46:34,22 --> 00:46:37,53
including water temperature,
swell and wind speed predictions

1265
00:46:34,22 --> 00:46:37,53
including water temperature,
swell and wind speed predictions

1266
00:46:37,59 --> 00:46:38,96
for your favorite beach.

1267
00:46:39,03 --> 00:46:41,03
Or new parents can use Glow Baby

1268
00:46:41,10 --> 00:46:44,73
to see nap, changing and feeding times
all on one face.

1269
00:46:41,10 --> 00:46:44,73
to see nap, changing and feeding times
all on one face.

1270
00:46:44,80 --> 00:46:48,30
While Nike Run Club can display stats
like pace from your last run

1271
00:46:44,80 --> 00:46:48,30
While Nike Run Club can display stats
like pace from your last run

1272
00:46:48,37 --> 00:46:49,91
and your weekly run goals.

1273
00:46:50,51 --> 00:46:53,44
We're also bringing rich complications
to more faces,

1274
00:46:53,51 --> 00:46:55,88
including a fresh Chronograph face

1275
00:46:53,51 --> 00:46:55,88
including a fresh Chronograph face

1276
00:46:55,94 --> 00:46:57,78
with an integrated tachymeter

1277
00:46:57,85 --> 00:46:59,55
and an updated Extra Large face

1278
00:46:59,62 --> 00:47:02,52
with a huge, rich complication
right in the center.

1279
00:46:59,62 --> 00:47:02,52
with a huge, rich complication
right in the center.

1280
00:47:02,58 --> 00:47:05,19
And Configuring Watch Faces
has been redesigned

1281
00:47:05,25 --> 00:47:08,96
so you can easily select
which information you'd like to see.

1282
00:47:05,25 --> 00:47:08,96
so you can easily select
which information you'd like to see.

1283
00:47:09,39 --> 00:47:11,26
As developers, with watchOS 7

1284
00:47:11,33 --> 00:47:14,60
you can now build your rich complications
with native SwiftUI.

1285
00:47:11,33 --> 00:47:14,60
you can now build your rich complications
with native SwiftUI.

1286
00:47:15,16 --> 00:47:17,40
While there are so many ways
to configure watch faces,

1287
00:47:17,47 --> 00:47:19,94
you may not have yet gone in
and set these up for yourself yet.

1288
00:47:17,47 --> 00:47:19,94
you may not have yet gone in
and set these up for yourself yet.

1289
00:47:20,00 --> 00:47:21,00
That's okay.

1290
00:47:21,07 --> 00:47:24,94
With watchOS 7 we're making it super easy
to share watch faces,

1291
00:47:21,07 --> 00:47:24,94
With watchOS 7 we're making it super easy
to share watch faces,

1292
00:47:25,01 --> 00:47:27,81
so you can discover a face
that works perfectly for you.

1293
00:47:27,88 --> 00:47:30,68
To do this,
we're introducing Face Sharing.

1294
00:47:27,88 --> 00:47:30,68
To do this,
we're introducing Face Sharing.

1295
00:47:31,45 --> 00:47:35,75
You'll be able to discover curated faces
with third-party apps on the App Store,

1296
00:47:35,82 --> 00:47:39,12
or discover a new favorite watch face
right on a website,

1297
00:47:35,82 --> 00:47:39,12
or discover a new favorite watch face
right on a website,

1298
00:47:39,19 --> 00:47:42,29
or receive watch faces
directly from friends and family.

1299
00:47:39,19 --> 00:47:42,29
or receive watch faces
directly from friends and family.

1300
00:47:42,36 --> 00:47:43,99
Let's take a look at how this works.

1301
00:47:44,83 --> 00:47:48,60
When you see a watch face you'd like,
you just press "Add Apple Watch Face."

1302
00:47:44,83 --> 00:47:48,60
When you see a watch face you'd like,
you just press "Add Apple Watch Face."

1303
00:47:49,16 --> 00:47:51,77
If the watch face uses some apps
that you don't have yet,

1304
00:47:51,83 --> 00:47:55,60
you'll be offered each one right here
so you can easily get them if you like.

1305
00:47:51,83 --> 00:47:55,60
you'll be offered each one right here
so you can easily get them if you like.

1306
00:47:55,67 --> 00:47:58,04
And the new face appears
right on your watch.

1307
00:47:58,11 --> 00:48:00,58
If you'd like to share a face
you've created yourself,

1308
00:47:58,11 --> 00:48:00,58
If you'd like to share a face
you've created yourself,

1309
00:48:00,64 --> 00:48:02,18
that's also really easy.

1310
00:48:02,24 --> 00:48:04,28
Just long press on the face,

1311
00:48:04,35 --> 00:48:07,32
tap "Share," pick a contact and send.

1312
00:48:04,35 --> 00:48:07,32
tap "Share," pick a contact and send.

1313
00:48:08,58 --> 00:48:11,95
Developers can offer preconfigured
watch faces right from their apps.

1314
00:48:12,02 --> 00:48:15,32
You can even share watch faces
across social media.

1315
00:48:15,39 --> 00:48:18,66
It's a great way for the community
of Apple Watch wearers to connect

1316
00:48:15,39 --> 00:48:18,66
It's a great way for the community
of Apple Watch wearers to connect

1317
00:48:18,73 --> 00:48:22,63
and help each other discover all the
amazing things Apple Watch is capable of.

1318
00:48:22,70 --> 00:48:25,27
Next, let's talk about Maps.

1319
00:48:22,70 --> 00:48:25,27
Next, let's talk about Maps.

1320
00:48:25,33 --> 00:48:29,00
Maps is great for walking, driving
and transit directions,

1321
00:48:29,61 --> 00:48:32,47
and now in watchOS, just like in iOS 14,

1322
00:48:29,61 --> 00:48:32,47
and now in watchOS, just like in iOS 14,

1323
00:48:32,54 --> 00:48:34,28
you can get cycling directions.

1324
00:48:35,14 --> 00:48:36,78
You'll see a variety of routes

1325
00:48:35,14 --> 00:48:36,78
You'll see a variety of routes

1326
00:48:36,85 --> 00:48:39,88
with information like time, distance

1327
00:48:39,95 --> 00:48:41,62
and whether there are bike lanes.

1328
00:48:42,82 --> 00:48:45,95
You can preview travel time
and elevation changes

1329
00:48:46,02 --> 00:48:49,99
and navigate with turn-by-turn directions
that are large and easy to read.

1330
00:48:46,02 --> 00:48:49,99
and navigate with turn-by-turn directions
that are large and easy to read.

1331
00:48:50,69 --> 00:48:53,70
Maps can direct you to dismount
and walk your bike

1332
00:48:53,76 --> 00:48:56,03
or even take the stairs to save time.

1333
00:48:53,76 --> 00:48:56,03
or even take the stairs to save time.

1334
00:48:56,97 --> 00:49:00,00
You can also search for and add places
optimized for cyclists,

1335
00:48:56,97 --> 00:49:00,00
You can also search for and add places
optimized for cyclists,

1336
00:49:00,07 --> 00:49:01,34
like bike repair shops.

1337
00:49:01,40 --> 00:49:02,27
[chimes]

1338
00:49:02,34 --> 00:49:05,04
Now to tell you about
how we're advancing Workouts,

1339
00:49:05,34 --> 00:49:07,38
please welcome Julz Arney.

1340
00:49:05,34 --> 00:49:07,38
please welcome Julz Arney.

1341
00:49:07,81 --> 00:49:09,08
Thanks, Kevin.

1342
00:49:09,14 --> 00:49:11,71
The Workout app uses algorithms
that are smartly tuned

1343
00:49:11,78 --> 00:49:13,72
to track all aspects of your training.

1344
00:49:11,78 --> 00:49:13,72
to track all aspects of your training.

1345
00:49:14,12 --> 00:49:16,12
It's one of the most used apps
on Apple Watch,

1346
00:49:16,19 --> 00:49:19,79
and we've continued to add support
for new workout types every year.

1347
00:49:16,19 --> 00:49:19,79
and we've continued to add support
for new workout types every year.

1348
00:49:19,86 --> 00:49:23,39
-And in watchOS 7 we're adding Dance.
-[dance music playing]

1349
00:49:23,46 --> 00:49:26,06
Dance is a total body workout
that's great for your heart.

1350
00:49:23,46 --> 00:49:26,06
Dance is a total body workout
that's great for your heart.

1351
00:49:26,13 --> 00:49:29,80
It makes you more fit and flexible,
and you're guaranteed to have fun.

1352
00:49:29,87 --> 00:49:35,00
Whether you're doing Hip Hop, Latin,
Bollywood, or simply Cardio Dance,

1353
00:49:29,87 --> 00:49:35,00
Whether you're doing Hip Hop, Latin,
Bollywood, or simply Cardio Dance,

1354
00:49:35,07 --> 00:49:36,31
the Workout app now tracks

1355
00:49:35,07 --> 00:49:36,31
the Workout app now tracks

1356
00:49:36,37 --> 00:49:39,51
some of the world's most popular
styles of dance for fitness.

1357
00:49:40,24 --> 00:49:43,65
Getting the most accurate credit for Dance
presented a unique challenge.

1358
00:49:40,24 --> 00:49:43,65
Getting the most accurate credit for Dance
presented a unique challenge.

1359
00:49:43,71 --> 00:49:46,85
Arm movements aren't always repetitive
or synchronized with leg movements

1360
00:49:46,92 --> 00:49:48,78
like in running and walking.

1361
00:49:46,92 --> 00:49:48,78
like in running and walking.

1362
00:49:48,85 --> 00:49:51,45
The solution was to use
advanced sensor fusion.

1363
00:49:51,52 --> 00:49:52,52
[music continues]

1364
00:49:52,59 --> 00:49:55,69
In Dance, we combine data from
the accelerometer and the gyroscope

1365
00:49:52,59 --> 00:49:55,69
In Dance, we combine data from
the accelerometer and the gyroscope

1366
00:49:55,76 --> 00:49:58,56
to detect the difference between
dancing with just your arms...

1367
00:49:59,53 --> 00:50:00,83
just your lower body...

1368
00:49:59,53 --> 00:50:00,83
just your lower body...

1369
00:50:02,13 --> 00:50:05,53
or when you put it all together
and dance with your entire body.

1370
00:50:05,60 --> 00:50:06,97
Then we add in heart rate data

1371
00:50:05,60 --> 00:50:06,97
Then we add in heart rate data

1372
00:50:07,04 --> 00:50:09,84
for the most accurate
calorie burn calculations.

1373
00:50:10,41 --> 00:50:13,84
watchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories
for Core Training,

1374
00:50:10,41 --> 00:50:13,84
watchOS 7 also tracks accurate calories
for Core Training,

1375
00:50:13,91 --> 00:50:16,38
those exercises for your abs and back,

to add on to another workout

1381
00:50:23,19 --> 00:50:24,72
to add on to another workout

1382
00:50:24,79 --> 00:50:27,22
when you want to continue
with easy moves and stretches

1383
00:50:27,29 --> 00:50:29,86
as you bring your heart rate
and breathing back to normal.

1384
00:50:29,93 --> 00:50:33,33
Of course, you can track your progress
for any of these new workouts

1385

Of course, you can track your progress
for any of these new workouts

1386
00:50:33,40 --> 00:50:35,36
inside the Activity app on iPhone,

1387
00:50:35,43 --> 00:50:38,27
which is completely redesigned
in watchOS 7.

[music continues]

1397
00:50:52,55 --> 00:50:53,92
Fitness.

1398
00:50:53,98 --> 00:50:55,72
Back to you, Kevin.

1399
00:50:53,98 --> 00:50:55,72
Back to you, Kevin.

1401
00:50:58,15 --> 00:50:59,22
Thanks, Julz.

1402
00:50:59,62 --> 00:51:02,06
Apple Watch helps you meet
not only your fitness goals,

1403
00:50:59,62 --> 00:51:02,06
Apple Watch helps you meet
not only your fitness goals,

1404
00:51:02,12 --> 00:51:03,89
but also helps support your health

1405
00:51:03,96 --> 00:51:08,20
with features such as Cycle Tracking,
the Breathe app, and Noise notifications.

1406
00:51:03,96 --> 00:51:08,20
with features such as Cycle Tracking,
the Breathe app, and Noise notifications.

1407
00:51:08,26 --> 00:51:12,07
And we're going to be adding even more
capabilities this year in watchOS 7.

1408
00:51:08,26 --> 00:51:12,07
And we're going to be adding even more
capabilities this year in watchOS 7.

1409
00:51:12,13 --> 00:51:14,27
We'd like to share a couple of them
with you today,

1410
00:51:14,34 --> 00:51:17,57
starting with one of the most-requested
features for Apple Watch:

1411
00:51:17,94 --> 00:51:19,41
tracking your sleep.

1412
00:51:17,94 --> 00:51:19,41
tracking your sleep.

1413
00:51:19,88 --> 00:51:22,11
To tell you about this, over to Vera Carr.

1414
00:51:22,74 --> 00:51:23,88
Thanks, Kevin.

1415
00:51:23,95 --> 00:51:28,18
There are many ways to look at sleep:
scores, advanced monitoring,

1416
00:51:23,95 --> 00:51:28,18
There are many ways to look at sleep:
scores, advanced monitoring,

1417
00:51:28,25 --> 00:51:30,32
or sleep cycle analysis.

1418
00:51:28,25 --> 00:51:30,32
or sleep cycle analysis.

1419
00:51:30,39 --> 00:51:32,99
We are taking
a more holistic approach to sleep

1420
00:51:33,06 --> 00:51:36,09
by leveraging the devices you use
every day

1421
00:51:33,06 --> 00:51:36,09
by leveraging the devices you use
every day

1422
00:51:36,16 --> 00:51:37,86
to not only track your sleep

1423
00:51:37,93 --> 00:51:41,66
but to support you in actually meeting
your sleep duration goal.

1424
00:51:41,73 --> 00:51:45,30
That starts with choosing not only when
you would like to wake up in the morning,

1425
00:51:41,73 --> 00:51:45,30
That starts with choosing not only when
you would like to wake up in the morning,

1426
00:51:45,37 --> 00:51:47,57
but also when you'd like to go to bed.

1427
00:51:48,00 --> 00:51:50,64
For most of us, setting a goal is easy.

1428
00:51:50,71 --> 00:51:53,31
But getting to bed on time,
that's the hard part.

1429
00:51:53,78 --> 00:51:57,05
Experts say that establishing
a bedtime routine

1430
00:51:53,78 --> 00:51:57,05
Experts say that establishing
a bedtime routine

1431
00:51:57,11 --> 00:52:00,78
helps the body transition
from wakefulness to sleep.

1432
00:51:57,11 --> 00:52:00,78
helps the body transition
from wakefulness to sleep.

1433
00:52:00,85 --> 00:52:03,32
So we are offering Wind Down.

1434
00:52:03,85 --> 00:52:07,26
It can help you get to bed on time
by minimizing distractions

1435
00:52:03,85 --> 00:52:07,26
It can help you get to bed on time
by minimizing distractions

1436
00:52:07,32 --> 00:52:09,63
and creating a personalized routine.

1437
00:52:10,09 --> 00:52:11,53
Let's look at how this works.

1438
00:52:12,23 --> 00:52:14,16
In the evening, ahead of your bedtime,

1439
00:52:14,23 --> 00:52:16,20
your phone can display
the Wind Down screen

1440
00:52:16,27 --> 00:52:19,47
to help you transition mentally
before you go to bed.

1441
00:52:16,27 --> 00:52:19,47
to help you transition mentally
before you go to bed.

1442
00:52:19,54 --> 00:52:24,04
It creates a calm lock screen experience
and turns on Do Not Disturb for you.

1443
00:52:19,54 --> 00:52:24,04
It creates a calm lock screen experience
and turns on Do Not Disturb for you.

1444
00:52:24,41 --> 00:52:26,34
You can also set up shortcuts

1445
00:52:26,41 --> 00:52:30,41
for simple things you may like to do
to help you prepare for bed.

1446
00:52:26,41 --> 00:52:30,41
for simple things you may like to do
to help you prepare for bed.

1447
00:52:30,48 --> 00:52:33,15
These might include
using your favorite meditation app

1448
00:52:33,22 --> 00:52:35,58
or playing relaxing music.

1449
00:52:35,95 --> 00:52:37,69
Once it's time for bed,

1450
00:52:35,95 --> 00:52:37,69
Once it's time for bed,

1451
00:52:37,75 --> 00:52:41,12
your screen will dim and your watch
will go into Sleep Mode,

1452
00:52:41,52 --> 00:52:42,99
which looks like this.

1453
00:52:41,52 --> 00:52:42,99
which looks like this.

1454
00:52:43,46 --> 00:52:46,96
The screen will be off during time in bed
so it won't bother you,

1455
00:52:47,03 --> 00:52:50,17
and a tap displays this simple face.

1456
00:52:47,03 --> 00:52:50,17
and a tap displays this simple face.

1457
00:52:50,23 --> 00:52:51,67
When it's time to wake up,

1458
00:52:51,73 --> 00:52:55,50
you have a selection of gentle
and effective alarm sounds,

1459
00:52:51,73 --> 00:52:55,50
you have a selection of gentle
and effective alarm sounds,

1460
00:52:55,57 --> 00:53:00,78
or a silent Taptic-only wake-up alarm
so you don't disturb your partner.

1461
00:52:55,57 --> 00:53:00,78
or a silent Taptic-only wake-up alarm
so you don't disturb your partner.

1462
00:53:00,84 --> 00:53:05,21
Once you're up, you'll see a friendly
greeting easing you into the day.

1463
00:53:05,75 --> 00:53:07,78
It also shows your battery level

1464
00:53:05,75 --> 00:53:07,78
It also shows your battery level

1465
00:53:07,85 --> 00:53:10,32
so you can remember to charge
in the morning.

1466
00:53:10,39 --> 00:53:11,85
Apple Watch tracks your sleep

1467
00:53:11,92 --> 00:53:14,72
using a machine-learning model
that senses your motion

1468
00:53:11,92 --> 00:53:14,72
using a machine-learning model
that senses your motion

1469
00:53:14,79 --> 00:53:17,06
and even interprets the micro-movements

1470
00:53:17,13 --> 00:53:19,73
caused by the rise and fall
of your breath,

1471
00:53:17,13 --> 00:53:19,73
caused by the rise and fall
of your breath,

1472
00:53:19,80 --> 00:53:22,90
providing signals for when you're awake
and when you're asleep.

1473
00:53:23,60 --> 00:53:26,00
There's an updated Sleep section
in the Health app,

1474
00:53:23,60 --> 00:53:26,00
There's an updated Sleep section
in the Health app,

1475
00:53:26,07 --> 00:53:29,07
including a view of your trends over time.

1476
00:53:29,74 --> 00:53:32,57
Sleep Schedules, Wind Down, and Sleep Mode

1477
00:53:29,74 --> 00:53:32,57
Sleep Schedules, Wind Down, and Sleep Mode

1478
00:53:32,64 --> 00:53:37,38
are also available on iPhone,
without a watch, in iOS 14.

1479
00:53:32,64 --> 00:53:37,38
are also available on iPhone,
without a watch, in iOS 14.

1480
00:53:37,81 --> 00:53:40,72
We know you'll enjoy using
your watch throughout the day

1481
00:53:40,78 --> 00:53:42,72
and now throughout the night.

1482
00:53:40,78 --> 00:53:42,72
and now throughout the night.

1483
00:53:43,09 --> 00:53:44,52
Thanks, Vera.

1484
00:53:44,59 --> 00:53:46,26
In addition to sleep keeping you healthy,

1485
00:53:46,32 --> 00:53:49,86
there's another preventative-care item
that's so important, particularly now:

1486
00:53:46,32 --> 00:53:49,86
there's another preventative-care item
that's so important, particularly now:

1487
00:53:50,96 --> 00:53:52,09
handwashing.

1488
00:53:52,86 --> 00:53:54,00
In watchOS 7,

1489
00:53:52,86 --> 00:53:54,00
In watchOS 7,

1490
00:53:54,06 --> 00:53:58,07
Apple Watch is the first watch
to deliver automatic detection

1491
00:53:58,13 --> 00:54:01,70
when you start washing your hands
and sensing of how long you actually wash.

1492
00:53:58,13 --> 00:54:01,70
when you start washing your hands
and sensing of how long you actually wash.

1493
00:54:02,27 --> 00:54:04,57
Our approach here is using
machine-learning models

1494
00:54:04,64 --> 00:54:07,08
to determine motion
which appears to be handwashing

1495
00:54:04,64 --> 00:54:07,08
to determine motion
which appears to be handwashing

1496
00:54:07,14 --> 00:54:09,75
and then use audio
to confirm the sound of running water

1497
00:54:09,81 --> 00:54:11,81
or squishing soap on your hands.

1498
00:54:12,31 --> 00:54:15,08
During this, you'll get a little coaching
to do a good job.

1499
00:54:15,68 --> 00:54:18,22
You'll see a countdown,
along with haptics and sounds,

1500
00:54:15,68 --> 00:54:18,22
You'll see a countdown,
along with haptics and sounds,

1501
00:54:18,29 --> 00:54:20,72
to make sure you wash
as long as you're supposed to.

1502
00:54:20,79 --> 00:54:23,79
If you pause early,
there's a polite note to keep washing.

1503
00:54:23,86 --> 00:54:26,66
And when you're done,
you'll see, hear and feel it.

1504
00:54:23,86 --> 00:54:26,66
And when you're done,
you'll see, hear and feel it.

1505
00:54:27,46 --> 00:54:30,83
That's just some of what's coming
this year in watchOS 7,

1506
00:54:27,46 --> 00:54:30,83
That's just some of what's coming
this year in watchOS 7,

1507
00:54:30,90 --> 00:54:34,34
including discovering and sharing faces,
new workout types,

1508
00:54:34,40 --> 00:54:36,17
sleep and handwashing detection,

1509
00:54:34,40 --> 00:54:36,17
sleep and handwashing detection,

1510
00:54:36,24 --> 00:54:39,37
and other new capabilities
like Siri language translation.

1511
00:54:40,11 --> 00:54:41,61
And that's Apple Watch.

1512
00:54:41,68 --> 00:54:43,31
It's time for you to join Craig again

1513
00:54:41,68 --> 00:54:43,31
It's time for you to join Craig again

1514
00:54:43,38 --> 00:54:46,01
to talk about something
that's important to all of us.

1515
00:54:46,08 --> 00:54:47,25
Here we go!

1516
00:54:48,62 --> 00:54:50,59
["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing]

1517
00:55:28,39 --> 00:55:29,89
[song ends]

1518
00:55:29,96 --> 00:55:33,50
At Apple, we believe
privacy is a fundamental human right.

1519
00:55:29,96 --> 00:55:33,50
At Apple, we believe
privacy is a fundamental human right.

1520
00:55:33,56 --> 00:55:37,47
So we build it into our products
from the beginning of the design process.

1521
00:55:33,56 --> 00:55:37,47
So we build it into our products
from the beginning of the design process.

1522
00:55:38,50 --> 00:55:40,94
Privacy matters now more than ever.

1523
00:55:41,00 --> 00:55:43,84
And because our devices contain
our most sensitive information,

1524
00:55:41,00 --> 00:55:43,84
And because our devices contain
our most sensitive information,

1525
00:55:43,91 --> 00:55:47,94
all of our product work is grounded
in a set of privacy principles.

1526
00:55:48,54 --> 00:55:51,01
First, data minimization.

1527
00:55:51,08 --> 00:55:53,28
We use innovative technologies
and techniques

1528
00:55:53,35 --> 00:55:57,55
to minimize the personal data
we or anyone else can access.

1529
00:55:53,35 --> 00:55:57,55
to minimize the personal data
we or anyone else can access.

1530
00:55:57,62 --> 00:56:00,22
Second, on-device intelligence.

1531
00:55:57,62 --> 00:56:00,22
Second, on-device intelligence.

1532
00:56:00,29 --> 00:56:01,69
We avoid data collection

1533
00:56:01,76 --> 00:56:05,43
by processing as much of your information
on your device as we can

1534
00:56:05,49 --> 00:56:07,46
rather than sending it to a server.

1535
00:56:05,49 --> 00:56:07,46
rather than sending it to a server.

1536
00:56:07,53 --> 00:56:09,43
Third, security.

1537
00:56:09,90 --> 00:56:14,07
Security protections are foundational
to everything we do in privacy.

1538
00:56:09,90 --> 00:56:14,07
Security protections are foundational
to everything we do in privacy.

1539
00:56:14,14 --> 00:56:17,04
And finally, transparency and control.

1540
00:56:17,11 --> 00:56:19,61
It helps you better understand
the data being collected

1541
00:56:17,11 --> 00:56:19,61
It helps you better understand
the data being collected

1542
00:56:19,68 --> 00:56:23,88
so that you can make your own choices
about how that data is used.

1543
00:56:23,95 --> 00:56:26,58
These principles come together
across our products,

1544
00:56:23,95 --> 00:56:26,58
These principles come together
across our products,

1545
00:56:26,65 --> 00:56:29,85
in our hardware,
our software and our services.

1546
00:56:30,29 --> 00:56:35,56
At the end of the day, they result
in great privacy and great ease of use.

1547
00:56:35,62 --> 00:56:38,56
A powerful example of this
is Sign in with Apple,

1548
00:56:35,62 --> 00:56:38,56
A powerful example of this
is Sign in with Apple,

1549
00:56:38,63 --> 00:56:41,63
which is designed for simplicity,
security and privacy.

1550
00:56:41,70 --> 00:56:43,77
And since we launched it last year,

1551
00:56:41,70 --> 00:56:43,77
And since we launched it last year,

1552
00:56:43,83 --> 00:56:46,94
users have created
over 200 million accounts

1553
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:50,67
across a wide variety of apps
and websites.

1554
00:56:47,00 --> 00:56:50,67
across a wide variety of apps
and websites.

1555
00:56:50,74 --> 00:56:54,11
And developers are seeing great usage
when they adopt it.

1556
00:56:50,74 --> 00:56:54,11
And developers are seeing great usage
when they adopt it.

1557
00:56:54,18 --> 00:56:55,41
For example,

1558
00:56:55,48 --> 00:56:57,51
Kayak has integrated Sign in with Apple

1559
00:56:57,58 --> 00:57:01,32
and found that their users are now
two times more likely to use it

1560
00:56:57,58 --> 00:57:01,32
and found that their users are now
two times more likely to use it

1561
00:57:01,38 --> 00:57:03,82
than any other sign-in provider.

1562
00:57:04,29 --> 00:57:06,89
Now, one thing we hear a lot
with Sign in with Apple

1563
00:57:04,29 --> 00:57:06,89
Now, one thing we hear a lot
with Sign in with Apple

1564
00:57:06,96 --> 00:57:10,66
is that people wish they could convert
their existing accounts to use it.

1565
00:57:10,73 --> 00:57:15,16
So this year we're going to enable
developers to let you do just that.

1566
00:57:10,73 --> 00:57:15,16
So this year we're going to enable
developers to let you do just that.

1567
00:57:15,23 --> 00:57:17,43
When you upgrade, you get the ease of use

1568
00:57:17,50 --> 00:57:19,80
and built-in security
of Sign in with Apple

1569
00:57:17,50 --> 00:57:19,80
and built-in security
of Sign in with Apple

1570
00:57:19,87 --> 00:57:22,37
while keeping the account
that you already have.

1571
00:57:23,31 --> 00:57:27,41
This is another big year
of privacy improvements in our products.

1572
00:57:23,31 --> 00:57:27,41
This is another big year
of privacy improvements in our products.

1573
00:57:27,48 --> 00:57:31,25
And to tell you more, here's Katie Skinner
and Erik Neuenschwander.

1574
00:57:27,48 --> 00:57:31,25
And to tell you more, here's Katie Skinner
and Erik Neuenschwander.

1575
00:57:32,71 --> 00:57:33,68
Thanks, Craig.

1576
00:57:33,75 --> 00:57:35,65
First let's talk about location.

1577
00:57:35,72 --> 00:57:38,75
This year we're continuing to give you
even more control.

1578
00:57:35,72 --> 00:57:38,75
This year we're continuing to give you
even more control.

1579
00:57:38,82 --> 00:57:41,62
In addition to the option
of sharing your precise location,

1580
00:57:41,69 --> 00:57:45,13
you will have the option to only share
your approximate location with apps.

1581
00:57:41,69 --> 00:57:45,13
you will have the option to only share
your approximate location with apps.

1582
00:57:46,33 --> 00:57:48,36
We're also making changes
for mic and camera

1583
00:57:46,33 --> 00:57:48,36
We're also making changes
for mic and camera

1584
00:57:48,43 --> 00:57:50,23
so you always know when you're recording.

1585
00:57:50,67 --> 00:57:52,84
In addition to requiring your permission,

1586
00:57:52,90 --> 00:57:56,61
this year we're adding more visibility
for current or recent mic or camera use.

1587
00:57:52,90 --> 00:57:56,61
this year we're adding more visibility
for current or recent mic or camera use.

1588
00:57:56,67 --> 00:58:00,28
So if an app uses either one,
we'll indicate that in the status bar.

1589
00:57:56,67 --> 00:58:00,28
So if an app uses either one,
we'll indicate that in the status bar.

1590
00:58:00,71 --> 00:58:02,44
[Katie] Next, let's talk about tracking.

1591
00:58:02,51 --> 00:58:05,88
Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention
has been really successful on the web.

1592
00:58:05,95 --> 00:58:09,02
And this year, we wanted to help you
with tracking in apps.

1593
00:58:05,95 --> 00:58:09,02
And this year, we wanted to help you
with tracking in apps.

1594
00:58:09,08 --> 00:58:13,36
We believe tracking should always be
transparent and under your control.

1595
00:58:09,08 --> 00:58:13,36
We believe tracking should always be
transparent and under your control.

1596
00:58:13,42 --> 00:58:14,72
So moving forward,

1597
00:58:14,79 --> 00:58:17,89
App Store policy will require apps to ask
before tracking you

1598
00:58:17,96 --> 00:58:20,80
across apps and websites
owned by other companies.

1599
00:58:17,96 --> 00:58:20,80
across apps and websites
owned by other companies.

1600
00:58:20,86 --> 00:58:23,13
[Erik] Last, let's talk about app privacy.

1601
00:58:23,20 --> 00:58:26,07
Today we require that apps
have a privacy policy.

1602
00:58:23,20 --> 00:58:26,07
Today we require that apps
have a privacy policy.

1603
00:58:26,13 --> 00:58:28,70
Wouldn't it be great to even more quickly
and easily see

1604
00:58:28,77 --> 00:58:31,54
a summary of an app's privacy practices
before you download it?

1605
00:58:28,77 --> 00:58:31,54
a summary of an app's privacy practices
before you download it?

1606
00:58:31,61 --> 00:58:34,38
Now, where have we seen
something like that before?

1607
00:58:34,44 --> 00:58:36,85
For food, you have nutrition labels.

1608
00:58:34,44 --> 00:58:36,85
For food, you have nutrition labels.

1609
00:58:36,91 --> 00:58:40,35
You can see if it's packed with protein
or loaded with sugar, or maybe both,

1610
00:58:40,42 --> 00:58:41,95
all before you buy it.

1611
00:58:42,02 --> 00:58:45,59
So we thought it would be great
to have something similar for apps.

1612
00:58:45,65 --> 00:58:49,39
We're going to require each developer
to self-report their practices.

1613
00:58:45,65 --> 00:58:49,39
We're going to require each developer
to self-report their practices.

1614
00:58:49,46 --> 00:58:51,66
[Katie] We'll show you what they tell us.

1615
00:58:51,73 --> 00:58:54,96
You can see if the developer is collecting
a little bit of data on you

1616
00:58:51,73 --> 00:58:54,96
You can see if the developer is collecting
a little bit of data on you

1617
00:58:55,03 --> 00:58:56,73
or a lot of data,

1618
00:58:56,80 --> 00:58:59,67
or if they're sharing data
with other companies to track you,

1619
00:58:59,74 --> 00:59:01,14
and much more.

1620
00:58:59,74 --> 00:59:01,14
and much more.

1621
00:59:01,20 --> 00:59:02,74
[Erik] We're going to put this information

1622
00:59:02,80 --> 00:59:04,37
on product pages in the App Store.

1623
00:59:04,44 --> 00:59:07,68
So for each app, you can see
highlights of their privacy information

1624
00:59:04,44 --> 00:59:07,68
So for each app, you can see
highlights of their privacy information

1625
00:59:07,74 --> 00:59:09,14
before you download it.

1626
00:59:09,21 --> 00:59:11,88
And we're going to include this
in all of our App Stores.

1627
00:59:11,95 --> 00:59:13,75
Back over to you, Craig.

1628
00:59:11,95 --> 00:59:13,75
Back over to you, Craig.

1629
00:59:13,82 --> 00:59:15,32
Thanks, Katie and Erik.

1630
00:59:15,38 --> 00:59:18,59
These are some of the ways we're
strengthening the privacy of our platforms

1631
00:59:15,38 --> 00:59:18,59
These are some of the ways we're
strengthening the privacy of our platforms

1632
00:59:18,65 --> 00:59:21,86
and bringing new features
to give users even more control.

1633
00:59:22,56 --> 00:59:26,16
And one of the places where
privacy matters most is your home.

1634
00:59:22,56 --> 00:59:26,16
And one of the places where
privacy matters most is your home.

1635
00:59:26,86 --> 00:59:27,93
Like most of you,

1636
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:31,73
in the past few months I've spent
more time at home than I ever imagined.

1637
00:59:28,00 --> 00:59:31,73
in the past few months I've spent
more time at home than I ever imagined.

1638
00:59:31,80 --> 00:59:33,94
It's more clear than ever
just how important it is

1639
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:37,57
to live in a home
where the technology just works.

1640
00:59:34,00 --> 00:59:37,57
to live in a home
where the technology just works.

1641
00:59:37,64 --> 00:59:41,61
That brings us to some great new features
we're bringing to the home this year.

1642
00:59:41,68 --> 00:59:44,58
All of these features share
a few key attributes.

1643
00:59:41,68 --> 00:59:44,58
All of these features share
a few key attributes.

1644
00:59:44,65 --> 00:59:47,92
First, anything we develop for the home
should be easy,

1645
00:59:47,98 --> 00:59:50,15
from initial setup to everyday use,

1646
00:59:47,98 --> 00:59:50,15
from initial setup to everyday use,

1647
00:59:50,22 --> 00:59:54,26
just like how a tap of your iPhone
can automatically configure an Apple TV.

1648
00:59:50,22 --> 00:59:54,26
just like how a tap of your iPhone
can automatically configure an Apple TV.

1649
00:59:54,32 --> 00:59:58,46
Second, home products should never
compromise your privacy.

1650
00:59:58,53 --> 01:00:03,37
That's why your Siri requests use
a random identifier, not your Apple ID.

1651
00:59:58,53 --> 01:00:03,37
That's why your Siri requests use
a random identifier, not your Apple ID.

1652
01:00:03,43 --> 01:00:07,34
And finally, your devices should
all work better together,

1653
01:00:03,43 --> 01:00:07,34
And finally, your devices should
all work better together,

1654
01:00:07,40 --> 01:00:11,74
like how AirPlay lets you share
from your iPhone straight to the TV.

1655
01:00:11,81 --> 01:00:15,51
And when things are easy, private
and work together seamlessly,

1656
01:00:11,81 --> 01:00:15,51
And when things are easy, private
and work together seamlessly,

1657
01:00:15,58 --> 01:00:17,05
your home is more enjoyable,

1658
01:00:17,11 --> 01:00:19,75
whether you're watching TV,
listening to music

1659
01:00:17,11 --> 01:00:19,75
whether you're watching TV,
listening to music

1660
01:00:19,82 --> 01:00:22,12
or getting the most
out of your smart devices.

1661
01:00:22,18 --> 01:00:25,19
To tell you more
about what we have in store for the home,

1662
01:00:22,18 --> 01:00:25,19
To tell you more
about what we have in store for the home,

1663
01:00:25,25 --> 01:00:27,29
let me pass it to Yah Cason.

1664
01:00:30,99 --> 01:00:32,09
Thanks, Craig.

1665
01:00:32,16 --> 01:00:34,43
Let's start by talking about
the smart home.

1666
01:00:34,50 --> 01:00:37,73
With HomeKit,
we've given developers a robust framework

1667
01:00:34,50 --> 01:00:37,73
With HomeKit,
we've given developers a robust framework

1668
01:00:37,80 --> 01:00:41,37
to create smart home accessories
that are remarkably easy to set up

1669
01:00:41,44 --> 01:00:44,71
all while being end-to-end encrypted
to your Apple devices.

1670
01:00:41,44 --> 01:00:44,71
all while being end-to-end encrypted
to your Apple devices.

1671
01:00:44,77 --> 01:00:48,44
Already there's a rich ecosystem
of devices available.

1672
01:00:44,77 --> 01:00:48,44
Already there's a rich ecosystem
of devices available.

1673
01:00:48,51 --> 01:00:50,95
But we want to make it even easier
to build products

1674
01:00:51,01 --> 01:00:52,85
that work across more homes.

1675
01:00:52,92 --> 01:00:54,75
So we formed an alliance

1676
01:00:52,92 --> 01:00:54,75
So we formed an alliance

1677
01:00:54,82 --> 01:00:58,12
and partnered with Amazon, Google
and other industry leaders

1678
01:00:58,19 --> 01:01:01,76
to define a new interoperability
standard for the smart home.

1679
01:00:58,19 --> 01:01:01,76
to define a new interoperability
standard for the smart home.

1680
01:01:01,82 --> 01:01:03,39
We open-sourced HomeKit

1681
01:01:03,46 --> 01:01:07,36
to ensure its ease of use and privacy
are core to this effort.

1682
01:01:03,46 --> 01:01:07,36
to ensure its ease of use and privacy
are core to this effort.

1683
01:01:07,43 --> 01:01:10,53
And any accessory using HomeKit
or this new standard

1684
01:01:10,60 --> 01:01:13,77
will work incredibly well
across all your Apple devices.

1685
01:01:10,60 --> 01:01:13,77
will work incredibly well
across all your Apple devices.

1686
01:01:13,84 --> 01:01:16,07
And you control it all in the Home app,

1687
01:01:16,14 --> 01:01:18,81
the most secure way
to manage your smart home.

1688
01:01:16,14 --> 01:01:18,81
the most secure way
to manage your smart home.

1689
01:01:18,87 --> 01:01:22,01
Adding new devices to your home
has never been easier.

1690
01:01:22,08 --> 01:01:24,98
Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory.

1691
01:01:22,08 --> 01:01:24,98
Simply tap or scan to set up an accessory.

1692
01:01:25,05 --> 01:01:28,18
And in iOS 14, after you add an accessory,

1693
01:01:28,25 --> 01:01:30,52
the Home app will now suggest
useful automations

1694
01:01:28,25 --> 01:01:30,52
the Home app will now suggest
useful automations

1695
01:01:30,59 --> 01:01:33,22
so you can immediately
put your new device to work for you.

1696
01:01:33,29 --> 01:01:35,89
Automations are rules
that set your home to autopilot,

1697
01:01:35,96 --> 01:01:39,23
like automatically turning on
your porch lights when motion is detected

1698
01:01:35,96 --> 01:01:39,23
like automatically turning on
your porch lights when motion is detected

1699
01:01:39,29 --> 01:01:41,90
or having the garage door open
as you arrive home.

1700
01:01:41,96 --> 01:01:43,63
And now when you open the Home app,

1701
01:01:41,96 --> 01:01:43,63
And now when you open the Home app,

1702
01:01:43,70 --> 01:01:46,17
you'll see a new visual status
right up top

1703
01:01:46,24 --> 01:01:49,57
that prioritizes the accessories
which most need your attention.

1704
01:01:46,24 --> 01:01:49,57
that prioritizes the accessories
which most need your attention.

1705
01:01:49,64 --> 01:01:52,64
You can easily see if you've left
a door unlocked or the lights on

1706
01:01:52,71 --> 01:01:54,08
and quickly control them.

1707
01:01:52,71 --> 01:01:54,08
and quickly control them.

1708
01:01:54,14 --> 01:01:55,44
Let's take a closer look

1709
01:01:55,51 --> 01:01:58,28
at one of the most popular categories
of HomeKit accessories:

1710
01:01:58,35 --> 01:01:59,55

Millions of us have already added
smart bulbs to our homes,

1713
01:02:02,72 --> 01:02:05,15
many of which can change color on demand.

1714
01:02:05,22 --> 01:02:06,49
In iOS 14,

1715
01:02:05,22 --> 01:02:06,49
In iOS 14,

1716
01:02:06,56 --> 01:02:09,83
we're introducing a feature to help you
get the most out of those bulbs:

1717
01:02:09,89 --> 01:02:11,73
Adaptive lighting.

1718
01:02:11,79 --> 01:02:15,13

Turn it on to ease into the morning
with warm colors,

1722
01:02:16,53 --> 01:02:19,17
Turn it on to ease into the morning
with warm colors,

1723
01:02:19,23 --> 01:02:21,80

1724
01:02:21,87 --> 01:02:24,61
and wind down at night
by reducing blue light.

1726
01:02:24,67 --> 01:02:28,44
Adaptive lighting ensures
you get the right color at the right time.

1727
01:02:28,51 --> 01:02:32,28
Another popular smart home category
is cameras.

1729
01:02:32,35 --> 01:02:35,62
With HomeKit Secure Video
your cameras are completely private.

1730
01:02:35,68 --> 01:02:40,06
And in iOS 14, we're making your cameras
work even harder for you.

that focus on the most important areas.

1734
01:02:44,46 --> 01:02:46,36
This is great if you face a busy sidewalk

1735
01:02:46,43 --> 01:02:50,03
and only want to be alerted when people
actually walk up to your front door.

1736

announcing who's at the door.

And face recognition extends to HomePod,
announcing who's at the door.

1879
01:08:41,12 --> 01:08:43,95
Well, if you're a student of macOS,
you know this question

1880
01:08:44,02 --> 01:08:47,62
can only be answered by Apple's
legendary crack marketing team.

1881
01:08:47,69 --> 01:08:49,99
Their drug-fueled,
minibus-driven vision quests

1882
01:08:47,69 --> 01:08:49,99
Their drug-fueled,
minibus-driven vision quests

1883
01:08:50,06 --> 01:08:51,73
have yielded some great names

1884
01:08:51,79 --> 01:08:54,56
and, sadly, spawned a host of imitators.

1885
01:08:51,79 --> 01:08:54,56
and, sadly, spawned a host of imitators.

1886
01:08:54,63 --> 01:08:56,90
The truth is,
we can't responsibly continue

1887
01:08:56,97 --> 01:08:59,84
to inadvertently lead our competition
to copy these methods

1888
01:08:59,90 --> 01:09:02,00
when they clearly can't handle the trip.

1889
01:08:59,90 --> 01:09:02,00
when they clearly can't handle the trip.

1890
01:09:02,07 --> 01:09:05,47
So this year, we're leaving our process
shrouded in mystery

1891
01:09:05,54 --> 01:09:08,14
and taking you straight
to the glorious destination.

1892
01:09:05,54 --> 01:09:08,14
and taking you straight
to the glorious destination.

1893
01:09:08,21 --> 01:09:12,31
Our next release of macOS
is macOS Big Sur.

1894
01:09:08,21 --> 01:09:12,31
Our next release of macOS
is macOS Big Sur.

1895
01:09:13,18 --> 01:09:16,39
macOS Big Sur introduces
an entirely new design

1896
01:09:16,45 --> 01:09:20,56
and major updates to some of
the most essential apps on the platform.

1897
01:09:16,45 --> 01:09:20,56
and major updates to some of
the most essential apps on the platform.

1898
01:09:20,62 --> 01:09:22,12
And just like its name,

1899
01:09:22,19 --> 01:09:25,76
Big Sur brings you unmatched levels
of power and beauty.

1900
01:09:22,19 --> 01:09:25,76
Big Sur brings you unmatched levels
of power and beauty.

1901
01:09:26,56 --> 01:09:28,56
Let's start with design,

1902
01:09:28,63 --> 01:09:33,30
where we're making the biggest change
since the introduction of Mac OS X.

1903
01:09:28,63 --> 01:09:33,30
where we're making the biggest change
since the introduction of Mac OS X.

1904
01:09:33,37 --> 01:09:36,57
To tell you more about the philosophy
and incredible craftsmanship

1905
01:09:33,37 --> 01:09:36,57
To tell you more about the philosophy
and incredible craftsmanship

1906
01:09:36,64 --> 01:09:37,97
behind the new design,

1907
01:09:38,04 --> 01:09:40,51
here's a short video with Alan Dye.

1908
01:09:41,24 --> 01:09:42,81
[piano playing]

1909
01:09:41,24 --> 01:09:42,81
[piano playing]

1910
01:09:46,35 --> 01:09:49,32
At Apple, design has always been
about great ideas.

1911
01:09:46,35 --> 01:09:49,32
At Apple, design has always been
about great ideas.

1912
01:09:49,38 --> 01:09:54,12
Those ideas then are developed
with this obsessive dedication to detail.

1913
01:09:49,38 --> 01:09:54,12
Those ideas then are developed
with this obsessive dedication to detail.

1914
01:09:54,69 --> 01:09:57,79
If we care enough about all the details
that make up a product,

1915
01:09:57,86 --> 01:10:01,06
then in the end
we will have designed an experience

1916
01:09:57,86 --> 01:10:01,06
then in the end
we will have designed an experience

1917
01:10:01,13 --> 01:10:03,03
that really feels like
there's no other way it could be.

1918
01:10:03,10 --> 01:10:07,10
And the best example of this
is macOS Big Sur.

1919
01:10:03,10 --> 01:10:07,10
And the best example of this
is macOS Big Sur.

1920
01:10:10,14 --> 01:10:13,88
Our goal was to bring even more clarity
to the design of the software

1921
01:10:10,14 --> 01:10:13,88
Our goal was to bring even more clarity
to the design of the software

1922
01:10:13,94 --> 01:10:17,75
while retaining the Mac's
powerful capability and ease of use.

1923
01:10:17,81 --> 01:10:19,72
We started with the simplest of elements,

1924
01:10:17,81 --> 01:10:19,72
We started with the simplest of elements,

1925
01:10:19,78 --> 01:10:24,12
from the shape of a corner radius
to refinements in buttons and controls.

1926
01:10:19,78 --> 01:10:24,12
from the shape of a corner radius
to refinements in buttons and controls.

1927
01:10:26,09 --> 01:10:28,99
And we brought our unified language
of symbols to the Mac,

1928
01:10:29,06 --> 01:10:31,99
making them more consistent
and easier to recognize.

1929
01:10:29,06 --> 01:10:31,99
making them more consistent
and easier to recognize.

1930
01:10:33,16 --> 01:10:35,90
Depth, shading and translucency

1931
01:10:35,96 --> 01:10:38,20
are used to create hierarchy.

1932
01:10:35,96 --> 01:10:38,20
are used to create hierarchy.

1933
01:10:38,27 --> 01:10:41,07
These new materials are rich,
and they're vibrant.

1934
01:10:41,14 --> 01:10:43,21
They bridge light and dark.

1935
01:10:41,14 --> 01:10:43,21
They bridge light and dark.

1936
01:10:44,01 --> 01:10:47,91
We've reduced visual complexity
to keep the focus on users' content.

1937
01:10:49,28 --> 01:10:51,58
Buttons and controls appear
when you need them,

1938
01:10:51,65 --> 01:10:53,25
and they recede when you don't.

1939
01:10:53,62 --> 01:10:56,45
There's a new way
to access system-level controls

1940
01:10:53,62 --> 01:10:56,45
There's a new way
to access system-level controls

1941
01:10:56,52 --> 01:10:59,96
and a unified space
for notifications and widgets.

1942
01:11:00,02 --> 01:11:01,86
We've also created a new suite of sounds.

1943
01:11:01,92 --> 01:11:05,76
They're familiar to the Mac,
but remastered and more refined.

1944
01:11:05,83 --> 01:11:06,70
[pulses]

1945
01:11:05,83 --> 01:11:06,70
[pulses]

1946
01:11:06,76 --> 01:11:09,10
[alert notifications chiming]

1947
01:11:09,67 --> 01:11:12,13
We wanted consistency
throughout the ecosystem,

1948
01:11:09,67 --> 01:11:12,13
We wanted consistency
throughout the ecosystem,

1949
01:11:12,20 --> 01:11:15,90
so users can move fluidly
between their Apple devices.

1950
01:11:15,97 --> 01:11:19,34
But we also love that Mac icons
have a deep history

1951
01:11:15,97 --> 01:11:19,34
But we also love that Mac icons
have a deep history

1952
01:11:19,41 --> 01:11:21,28
and a distinct look and feel.

1953
01:11:22,01 --> 01:11:24,68
So we've retained
many of the highly crafted details

1954
01:11:22,01 --> 01:11:24,68
So we've retained
many of the highly crafted details

1955
01:11:24,75 --> 01:11:27,82
and the playful elements
that make Mac icons unique.

1956
01:11:30,12 --> 01:11:32,32
This OS reflects an important history.

1957
01:11:33,02 --> 01:11:37,29
It's familiar, but it's also
entirely new in every detail.

1958
01:11:33,02 --> 01:11:37,29
It's familiar, but it's also
entirely new in every detail.

1959
01:11:38,96 --> 01:11:39,96
We love the Mac.

1960
01:11:40,03 --> 01:11:43,23
It's the tool we use to make all the
products that we put out into the world.

1961
01:11:40,03 --> 01:11:43,23
It's the tool we use to make all the
products that we put out into the world.

1962
01:11:44,60 --> 01:11:47,60
And macOS Big Sur is where it starts.

1963
01:11:51,34 --> 01:11:54,24
[Craig] So that's the thinking
behind our new design.

1964
01:11:51,34 --> 01:11:54,24
[Craig] So that's the thinking
behind our new design.

1965
01:11:54,31 --> 01:11:57,11
Now let me show it to you
in action with a demo.

1966
01:12:00,45 --> 01:12:01,62
As Alan said,

1967
01:12:01,68 --> 01:12:05,19
we've refined some of the most iconic
elements of the Mac experience.

1968
01:12:05,25 --> 01:12:06,76
Let's start with the Dock.

1969
01:12:05,25 --> 01:12:06,76
Let's start with the Dock.

1970
01:12:06,82 --> 01:12:10,53
It has an elegant new design that floats
along the bottom of your desktop.

1971
01:12:10,59 --> 01:12:13,63
And you'll notice that we've created
gorgeous new app icons

1972
01:12:10,59 --> 01:12:13,63
And you'll notice that we've created
gorgeous new app icons

1973
01:12:13,70 --> 01:12:16,03
for all of your favorite apps.

1974
01:12:16,10 --> 01:12:18,53
Speaking of apps,
let's take a look at the Finder.

1975
01:12:16,10 --> 01:12:18,53
Speaking of apps,
let's take a look at the Finder.

1976
01:12:18,60 --> 01:12:23,87
You notice it has a gorgeous new
top-to-bottom design for the sidebar,

1977
01:12:23,94 --> 01:12:27,51
and it has a compact,
space-efficient toolbar.

1978
01:12:23,94 --> 01:12:27,51
and it has a compact,
space-efficient toolbar.

1979
01:12:27,58 --> 01:12:30,65
Makes it really easy
to get to all of your controls.

1980
01:12:27,58 --> 01:12:30,65
Makes it really easy
to get to all of your controls.

1981
01:12:31,21 --> 01:12:34,35
Next, let's take a look at Mail.

1982
01:12:34,42 --> 01:12:37,25
You can see that Mail has
all-new glyphs in the sidebar,

1983
01:12:34,42 --> 01:12:37,25
You can see that Mail has
all-new glyphs in the sidebar,

1984
01:12:37,32 --> 01:12:40,22
and you may have noticed
that we've brought color back as well.

1985
01:12:40,29 --> 01:12:42,52
Now, each app uses its own key color.

1986
01:12:40,29 --> 01:12:42,52
Now, each app uses its own key color.

1987
01:12:42,59 --> 01:12:46,63
That same color is used for the elegant
new rounded row selection style

1988
01:12:46,70 --> 01:12:48,50
here in the message list.

1989
01:12:46,70 --> 01:12:48,50
here in the message list.

1990
01:12:48,56 --> 01:12:51,47
Now, the toolbar makes it really easy
to get to all your controls.

1991
01:12:51,53 --> 01:12:54,47
Check out how the search bar expands
as I click on it.

1992
01:12:51,53 --> 01:12:54,47
Check out how the search bar expands
as I click on it.

1993
01:12:54,54 --> 01:12:56,71
And, of course,
other operations like filtering,

1994
01:12:56,77 --> 01:12:59,14
they're just a click away.

1995
01:12:59,21 --> 01:13:01,88
Next, let's take a look at Photos.

1996
01:12:59,21 --> 01:13:01,88
Next, let's take a look at Photos.

1997
01:13:01,94 --> 01:13:03,78
It's just stunning.

1998
01:13:03,85 --> 01:13:07,08
You can get to all your albums
and media types from the sidebar,

1999
01:13:03,85 --> 01:13:07,08
You can get to all your albums
and media types from the sidebar,

2000
01:13:07,15 --> 01:13:09,28
and the photo grid is backed by Metal,

2001
01:13:09,35 --> 01:13:11,52
so animations are super smooth

2002
01:13:11,59 --> 01:13:14,69
whether I'm scrolling, transitioning

2003
01:13:11,59 --> 01:13:14,69
whether I'm scrolling, transitioning

2004
01:13:14,76 --> 01:13:18,23
or zooming all the way in
or all the way out.

2005
01:13:14,76 --> 01:13:18,23
or zooming all the way in
or all the way out.

2006
01:13:18,63 --> 01:13:19,63
It's beautiful.

2007
01:13:20,13 --> 01:13:23,50
Now we've refreshed the design
for all the apps on the system,

2008
01:13:23,57 --> 01:13:26,77
from apps like Calendar and Notes

2009
01:13:23,57 --> 01:13:26,77
from apps like Calendar and Notes

2010
01:13:26,84 --> 01:13:30,37
to Podcasts and Music,
with its new Listen Now pane.

2011
01:13:26,84 --> 01:13:30,37
to Podcasts and Music,
with its new Listen Now pane.

2012
01:13:30,44 --> 01:13:35,14
And an all-new version of iWork
that features a simplified toolbar.

2013
01:13:35,21 --> 01:13:37,85
You may have noticed
we've also updated the menu bar.

2014
01:13:35,21 --> 01:13:37,85
You may have noticed
we've also updated the menu bar.

2015
01:13:37,91 --> 01:13:41,78
It's now translucent and elegantly takes
on the color of your desktop picture.

2016
01:13:42,52 --> 01:13:45,42
And we've updated the layout
of menus as well.

2017
01:13:45,49 --> 01:13:48,32
We've given all the items
just a little bit more room to breathe.

2018
01:13:45,49 --> 01:13:48,32
We've given all the items
just a little bit more room to breathe.

2019
01:13:48,39 --> 01:13:52,19
Now, on the Mac, we love our ability
to get directly at controls,

2020
01:13:52,26 --> 01:13:54,73
like Wi-Fi or Sound.

2021
01:13:52,26 --> 01:13:54,73
like Wi-Fi or Sound.

2022
01:13:54,80 --> 01:13:58,57
And you can see that we've reworked these
to be even more useful.

2023
01:13:58,63 --> 01:14:00,54
But we've gone even further this year

2024
01:13:58,63 --> 01:14:00,54
But we've gone even further this year

2025
01:14:00,60 --> 01:14:03,44
by giving you one place
to get at all your controls.

2026
01:14:03,51 --> 01:14:06,68
We've brought Control Center to the Mac.

2027
01:14:03,51 --> 01:14:06,68
We've brought Control Center to the Mac.

2028
01:14:06,74 --> 01:14:10,68
All of my controls are here,
and it's really easy to make adjustments.

2029
01:14:10,75 --> 01:14:13,55
For instance,
I can change display brightness here

2030
01:14:10,75 --> 01:14:13,55
For instance,
I can change display brightness here

2031
01:14:13,62 --> 01:14:16,52
or I can click to dive in for more,

2032
01:14:16,59 --> 01:14:18,99
like turning on Dark Mode
or activating Night Shift.

2033
01:14:16,59 --> 01:14:18,99
like turning on Dark Mode
or activating Night Shift.

2034
01:14:19,45 --> 01:14:22,12
And what's really cool is
that I can customize the menu bar

2035
01:14:22,19 --> 01:14:23,73
with any of these controls.

2036
01:14:23,79 --> 01:14:27,06
So, say I want one-click access
to Do Not Disturb.

2037
01:14:23,79 --> 01:14:27,06
So, say I want one-click access
to Do Not Disturb.

2038
01:14:27,56 --> 01:14:31,40
I can just click and drag it
right into my menu bar

2039
01:14:27,56 --> 01:14:31,40
I can just click and drag it
right into my menu bar

2040
01:14:31,47 --> 01:14:33,27
and customize just like that.

2041
01:14:33,87 --> 01:14:36,71
Now we've also reinvented
Notification Center.

2042
01:14:33,87 --> 01:14:36,71
Now we've also reinvented
Notification Center.

2043
01:14:36,77 --> 01:14:40,28
You can access it by clicking on the time
in the upper right.

2044
01:14:40,34 --> 01:14:42,54
And as you see, we now have a single view

2045
01:14:40,34 --> 01:14:42,54
And as you see, we now have a single view

2046
01:14:42,61 --> 01:14:46,05
that brings your notifications and widgets
together all in one place.

2047
01:14:46,11 --> 01:14:48,78
And we now group
related notifications together.

2048
01:14:46,11 --> 01:14:48,78
And we now group
related notifications together.

2049
01:14:48,85 --> 01:14:52,49
You can easily expand them
to take a closer look

2050
01:14:52,55 --> 01:14:55,56
or clear them all out in one step.

2051
01:14:52,55 --> 01:14:55,56
or clear them all out in one step.

2052
01:14:55,62 --> 01:14:58,33
And we're bringing our redesigned widgets
to the Mac.

2053
01:14:58,39 --> 01:14:59,73
They're really beautiful.

2054
01:14:59,80 --> 01:15:02,10
And you have all-new ways
to customize them.

2055
01:14:59,80 --> 01:15:02,10
And you have all-new ways
to customize them.

2056
01:15:02,16 --> 01:15:05,00
I'm just gonna click "Edit Widgets"
down here at the bottom.

2057
01:15:05,07 --> 01:15:07,90
And you can see
I have a gallery of all my widgets,

2058
01:15:05,07 --> 01:15:07,90
And you can see
I have a gallery of all my widgets,

2059
01:15:07,97 --> 01:15:10,54
and they come in a variety of sizes.

2060
01:15:10,61 --> 01:15:14,24
I can select between them just like this.

2061
01:15:10,61 --> 01:15:14,24
I can select between them just like this.

2062
01:15:14,31 --> 01:15:16,71
And developers can bring
their own widgets as well,

2063
01:15:16,78 --> 01:15:18,91
like this one here from Day One.

2064
01:15:16,78 --> 01:15:18,91
like this one here from Day One.

2065
01:15:18,98 --> 01:15:20,58
Now adding widgets is easy.

2066
01:15:21,18 --> 01:15:25,12
Let's start by adding,
say, the World Clock.

2067
01:15:21,18 --> 01:15:25,12
Let's start by adding,
say, the World Clock.

2068
01:15:25,19 --> 01:15:27,52
Maybe I'll add Notes in.

2069
01:15:27,59 --> 01:15:31,96
And it'd be kind of cool
to add my Reminders list as well.

2070
01:15:27,59 --> 01:15:31,96
And it'd be kind of cool
to add my Reminders list as well.

2071
01:15:33,16 --> 01:15:36,43
So that's a look at Widgets,
Notification Center

2072
01:15:33,16 --> 01:15:36,43
So that's a look at Widgets,
Notification Center

2073
01:15:36,50 --> 01:15:39,07
and our all-new design in Big Sur.

2074
01:15:39,54 --> 01:15:43,64
Next, there are exciting updates
for some of the most-used apps on the Mac.

2075
01:15:39,54 --> 01:15:43,64
Next, there are exciting updates
for some of the most-used apps on the Mac.

2076
01:15:44,27 --> 01:15:46,44
First, let's talk about Messages.

2077
01:15:47,08 --> 01:15:51,25
Messages on the Mac is designed to work
seamlessly with all of your devices,

2078
01:15:47,08 --> 01:15:51,25

01:15:54,35 --> 01:15:56,35
no matter what device you're using.

2082
01:15:56,42 --> 01:15:59,19

giving you fun ways to express yourself
in all of your conversations.

2093
01:16:20,98 --> 01:16:23,71
Messages effects helps you
celebrate special moments

2094
01:16:23,78 --> 01:16:24,98
and get your point across.

2095
01:16:23,78 --> 01:16:24,98
and get your point across.

2096
01:16:25,05 --> 01:16:27,65
And you're also getting
pinned conversations

2097
01:16:27,72 --> 01:16:30,95
that are synced across devices
so you can always get to them,

2098
01:16:27,72 --> 01:16:30,95
that are synced across devices
so you can always get to them,

2099
01:16:31,02 --> 01:16:33,09
along with new Groups enhancements.

01:16:41,80 --> 01:16:43,83
Next up, Maps.

2105
01:16:43,90 --> 01:16:48,00
Apple Maps is the best way
to explore and navigate the world,

2106
01:16:43,90 --> 01:16:48,00
Apple Maps is the best way
to explore and navigate the world,

2107
01:16:48,07 --> 01:16:50,11
whether you're planning a trip on the Mac

2108
01:16:50,17 --> 01:16:53,01
or using turn-by-turn directions
on your iPhone.

2109
01:16:53,08 --> 01:16:57,61
Today I'm excited to announce
an all-new version of Maps for the Mac.

2110
01:16:53,08 --> 01:16:57,61
Today I'm excited to announce
an all-new version of Maps for the Mac.

2111

01:16:58,05 --> 01:17:01,02
To start,
Maps features a stunning new design

2113
01:17:01,08 --> 01:17:05,39
that makes it easy to find your way around
using Apple's detailed new map.

2114
01:17:05,45 --> 01:17:07,02
And for the first time on the Mac,

2115
01:17:05,45 --> 01:17:07,02
And for the first time on the Mac,

2116
01:17:07,09 --> 01:17:10,86
Favorites like home, work
or that great coffee shop on the corner

2117
01:17:10,93 --> 01:17:13,43
are now just a click away.

2118
01:17:10,93 --> 01:17:13,43
are now just a click away.

2119
01:17:13,50 --> 01:17:16,37
You can now create your own Guides
of all the places you want to visit

2120
01:17:16,43 --> 01:17:17,97
right on your Mac.

2121
01:17:18,03 --> 01:17:19,80
And before leaving for the airport,

2122
01:17:19,87 --> 01:17:22,91
you can check where your gate is located
with indoor maps

2123
01:17:22,97 --> 01:17:25,74
or explore your destination city
with Look Around,

2124
01:17:22,97 --> 01:17:25,74
or explore your destination city
with Look Around,

2125
01:17:25,81 --> 01:17:28,11
which is incredible on the big screen.

2126
01:17:28,18 --> 01:17:31,05
We've even brought
other useful features to the Mac,

2127
01:17:28,18 --> 01:17:31,05
We've even brought
other useful features to the Mac,

2128
01:17:31,11 --> 01:17:33,32
like the ability to see
the progress of friends

2129
01:17:33,38 --> 01:17:35,02
who have shared their ETA with you.

2130
01:17:35,62 --> 01:17:38,15
And the Mac gets
all the other new Maps features

2131
01:17:35,62 --> 01:17:38,15
And the Mac gets
all the other new Maps features

2132
01:17:38,22 --> 01:17:40,49
we just introduced in iOS 14.

2133
01:17:41,42 --> 01:17:47,00
And that's just a taste of what's coming
in the all-new Apple Maps on the Mac.

2134
01:17:41,42 --> 01:17:47,00
And that's just a taste of what's coming
in the all-new Apple Maps on the Mac.

2135
01:17:47,06 --> 01:17:50,60
Next let's talk about Mac Catalyst.

2136
01:17:47,06 --> 01:17:50,60
Next let's talk about Mac Catalyst.

2137
01:17:50,67 --> 01:17:52,94
Catalyst gives developers a big head start

2138
01:17:53,00 --> 01:17:55,60
in creating a Mac app from an iPad app.

2139
01:17:53,00 --> 01:17:55,60
in creating a Mac app from an iPad app.

2140
01:17:55,67 --> 01:17:58,77
Take, for instance, our recent release
of Swift Playgrounds for Mac.

2141
01:17:58,84 --> 01:18:01,64
Catalyst gave us a big head start
creating the app,

2142
01:17:58,84 --> 01:18:01,64
Catalyst gave us a big head start
creating the app,

2143
01:18:01,71 --> 01:18:03,88
and we were able
to spend our development time

2144
01:18:03,95 --> 01:18:06,35
crafting a great Mac experience.

2145
01:18:03,95 --> 01:18:06,35
crafting a great Mac experience.

2146
01:18:06,92 --> 01:18:10,15
Today we have some improvements
to Mac Catalyst I'd like to share.

2147
01:18:10,72 --> 01:18:13,32
This year, developers will be able
to optimize their apps

2148
01:18:10,72 --> 01:18:13,32
This year, developers will be able
to optimize their apps

2149
01:18:13,39 --> 01:18:15,86
to fully utilize the native resolution
of the Mac screen,

2150
01:18:15,92 --> 01:18:19,33
providing total control of every pixel.

2151
01:18:15,92 --> 01:18:19,33
providing total control of every pixel.

2152
01:18:19,39 --> 01:18:21,76
We've also given developers
new capabilities,

2153
01:18:21,83 --> 01:18:25,13
including powerful new menu
and keyboard APIs

2154
01:18:21,83 --> 01:18:25,13
including powerful new menu
and keyboard APIs

2155
01:18:25,20 --> 01:18:28,50
and updated controls
like checkboxes and date pickers.

2156
01:18:28,57 --> 01:18:31,64
They look great
with the new design of macOS.

2157
01:18:28,57 --> 01:18:31,64
They look great
with the new design of macOS.

2158
01:18:31,71 --> 01:18:34,94
In fact, we used Catalyst
with the new version of Maps.

2159
01:18:35,01 --> 01:18:36,48
And just as you'd expect,

2160
01:18:35,01 --> 01:18:36,48
And just as you'd expect,

2161
01:18:36,55 --> 01:18:38,95
it's a full-fledged Mac app
that runs natively

2162
01:18:39,01 --> 01:18:41,22
and is designed
in a way that's true to the Mac.

2163
01:18:41,28 --> 01:18:45,15
So you get multiple resizable windows,
keyboard shortcuts

2164
01:18:41,28 --> 01:18:45,15
So you get multiple resizable windows,
keyboard shortcuts

2165
01:18:45,22 --> 01:18:48,89
and everything else you'd expect
from a native Mac app.

2166
01:18:45,22 --> 01:18:48,89
and everything else you'd expect
from a native Mac app.

2167
01:18:48,96 --> 01:18:51,56
And we did the same thing for Messages.

2168
01:18:51,63 --> 01:18:54,30
Maps and Messages join
the great set of apps from Apple

2169
01:18:51,63 --> 01:18:54,30
Maps and Messages join
the great set of apps from Apple

2170
01:18:54,36 --> 01:18:57,07
that already use
the Mac Catalyst technology.

2171
01:18:57,13 --> 01:18:59,87
And there's a growing list
of third-party Catalyst apps available

2172
01:18:59,94 --> 01:19:01,94
on the Mac App Store.

2173
01:18:59,94 --> 01:19:01,94
on the Mac App Store.

2174
01:19:02,47 --> 01:19:05,24
Next... Safari.

2175
01:19:05,31 --> 01:19:06,51
Our users love Safari

2176
01:19:05,31 --> 01:19:06,51
Our users love Safari

2177
01:19:06,58 --> 01:19:09,61
for its speedy performance,
power efficiency

2178
01:19:09,68 --> 01:19:12,48
and state-of-the-art privacy protections.

2179
01:19:09,68 --> 01:19:12,48
and state-of-the-art privacy protections.

2180
01:19:12,55 --> 01:19:13,95
And it delivers all of that

2181
01:19:14,02 --> 01:19:17,99
while making it easy to get to your
bookmarks, tabs and browsing history

2182
01:19:18,05 --> 01:19:19,66
across all of your devices.

2183
01:19:19,72 --> 01:19:22,89
This year, we're building
on Safari's amazing performance,

2184
01:19:22,96 --> 01:19:26,23
elegant design
and pioneering privacy protections

2185
01:19:22,96 --> 01:19:26,23
elegant design
and pioneering privacy protections

2186
01:19:26,30 --> 01:19:30,80
to deliver the biggest update to Safari
since it was first introduced.

2187
01:19:26,30 --> 01:19:30,80
to deliver the biggest update to Safari
since it was first introduced.

2188
01:19:30,87 --> 01:19:35,90
As you know, Safari has long been
the world's fastest desktop browser.

2189
01:19:35,97 --> 01:19:39,34
This year, Safari's performance
running JavaScript is better than ever

2190
01:19:35,97 --> 01:19:39,34
This year, Safari's performance
running JavaScript is better than ever

2191
01:19:39,41 --> 01:19:43,81
and continues to significantly outpace
all other major browsers.

2192
01:19:39,41 --> 01:19:43,81
and continues to significantly outpace
all other major browsers.

2193
01:19:44,35 --> 01:19:48,98
And now, when it comes to page loading,
we're even faster there too.

2194
01:19:44,35 --> 01:19:48,98
And now, when it comes to page loading,
we're even faster there too.

2195
01:19:49,05 --> 01:19:51,69
In fact, when loading
frequently visited websites,

2196
01:19:51,75 --> 01:19:55,96
Safari is now on average
more than 50% faster than Chrome.

2197
01:19:51,75 --> 01:19:55,96
Safari is now on average
more than 50% faster than Chrome.

2198
01:19:56,02 --> 01:19:58,69
And Safari delivers
this amazing performance

2199
01:19:58,76 --> 01:20:01,86
while continuing to deliver
industry-leading battery life.

2200
01:19:58,76 --> 01:20:01,86
while continuing to deliver
industry-leading battery life.

2201
01:20:02,50 --> 01:20:04,93
And of course,
Safari is continuing to build

2202
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:09,00
on its pioneering track record
of protecting user privacy.

2203
01:20:05,00 --> 01:20:09,00
on its pioneering track record
of protecting user privacy.

2204
01:20:09,07 --> 01:20:13,44
Safari was the first browser to introduce
private browsing, cookie blocking,

2205
01:20:09,07 --> 01:20:13,44
Safari was the first browser to introduce
private browsing, cookie blocking,

2206
01:20:13,51 --> 01:20:16,48
and most recently,
Intelligent Tracking Prevention.

2207
01:20:17,28 --> 01:20:20,38
This year, we want to give our users
even more visibility

2208
01:20:17,28 --> 01:20:20,38
This year, we want to give our users
even more visibility

2209
01:20:20,45 --> 01:20:23,19
into how each site they visit
tries to track them

2210
01:20:23,25 --> 01:20:25,99
and the ways that Safari protects them.

2211
01:20:23,25 --> 01:20:25,99
and the ways that Safari protects them.

2212
01:20:26,05 --> 01:20:29,06
So now users can click on
the Privacy Report button in the toolbar

2213
01:20:29,12 --> 01:20:30,16
when they visit a site

2214
01:20:29,12 --> 01:20:30,16
when they visit a site

2215
01:20:30,23 --> 01:20:33,33
to better understand
how that site is treating their privacy.

2216
01:20:34,16 --> 01:20:36,37
In addition to monitoring
unwanted tracking,

2217
01:20:34,16 --> 01:20:36,37
In addition to monitoring
unwanted tracking,

2218
01:20:36,43 --> 01:20:40,37
Safari now also securely monitors
your saved passwords

2219
01:20:40,44 --> 01:20:43,81
to ensure that they haven't been
compromised in a data breach.

2220
01:20:40,44 --> 01:20:43,81
to ensure that they haven't been
compromised in a data breach.

2221
01:20:44,31 --> 01:20:47,71
And this is also a big year
for extensions in Safari.

2222
01:20:47,78 --> 01:20:49,98
We're adding support
for the WebExtensions API

2223
01:20:47,78 --> 01:20:49,98
We're adding support
for the WebExtensions API

2224
01:20:50,05 --> 01:20:52,31
so developers can easily
bring over extensions

2225
01:20:52,38 --> 01:20:54,48
that they built for other browsers.

2226
01:20:52,38 --> 01:20:54,48
that they built for other browsers.

2227
01:20:54,55 --> 01:20:57,22
And we're building an all-new category
in the Mac App Store

2228
01:20:57,29 --> 01:21:01,66
to showcase Safari extensions
so users can easily find them.

2229
01:20:57,29 --> 01:21:01,66
to showcase Safari extensions
so users can easily find them.

2230
01:21:01,72 --> 01:21:03,89
Now extensions are very powerful

2231
01:21:03,96 --> 01:21:06,40
but can introduce privacy challenges.

2232
01:21:03,96 --> 01:21:06,40
but can introduce privacy challenges.

2233
01:21:06,46 --> 01:21:10,10
In other browsers, extensions can access
every page you visit,

2234
01:21:10,17 --> 01:21:11,70
every tab you open,

2235
01:21:11,77 --> 01:21:13,34
even everything you type.

2236
01:21:11,77 --> 01:21:13,34
even everything you type.

2237
01:21:13,40 --> 01:21:15,90
So we're doing even more here.

2238
01:21:16,47 --> 01:21:20,41
In Safari, you choose
which sites each extension can work with,

2239
01:21:16,47 --> 01:21:20,41
In Safari, you choose
which sites each extension can work with,

2240
01:21:20,48 --> 01:21:23,85
and you can even give them access
just for the day,

2241
01:21:23,91 --> 01:21:26,65
just for the website or all the time.

2242
01:21:23,91 --> 01:21:26,65
just for the website or all the time.

2243
01:21:26,72 --> 01:21:28,35
But improved performance,

2244
01:21:28,42 --> 01:21:32,52
power efficiency and privacy protections
are only the start.

2245
01:21:28,42 --> 01:21:32,52
power efficiency and privacy protections
are only the start.

2246
01:21:32,59 --> 01:21:34,86
We have a whole slew
of new features this year.

2247
01:21:34,92 --> 01:21:37,13
From a customizable start page

2248
01:21:34,92 --> 01:21:37,13
From a customizable start page

2249
01:21:37,19 --> 01:21:40,70
to redesigned tabs
that are more elegant and powerful,

2250
01:21:40,76 --> 01:21:45,93
and native translation capabilities
built right into Safari.

2251
01:21:40,76 --> 01:21:45,93
and native translation capabilities
built right into Safari.

2252
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:49,64
To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Beth Dakin.

2253
01:21:46,00 --> 01:21:49,64
To tell you more,
I'll hand it off to Beth Dakin.

2254
01:21:50,31 --> 01:21:51,34
Thanks, Craig.

2255
01:21:51,41 --> 01:21:54,64
I'm so excited to give you
a tour of the brand-new Safari.

2256
01:21:51,41 --> 01:21:54,64
I'm so excited to give you
a tour of the brand-new Safari.

2257
01:21:54,71 --> 01:21:58,48
When you open Safari,
right away you'll notice the new look.

2258
01:21:58,55 --> 01:22:00,05
It's clean and fresh.

2259
01:21:58,55 --> 01:22:00,05
It's clean and fresh.

2260
01:22:00,12 --> 01:22:02,55
I want to show you
one of my favorite new features:

2261
01:22:02,62 --> 01:22:03,99
the customizable start page.

2262
01:22:04,05 --> 01:22:05,95
I love it because I can make it my own.

2263
01:22:06,02 --> 01:22:08,09
It's easy to get to
the customization controls

2264
01:22:08,16 --> 01:22:09,63
here in the bottom corner.

2265
01:22:09,69 --> 01:22:12,76
We think a lot of people are gonna want
to set a background image,

2266
01:22:09,69 --> 01:22:12,76
We think a lot of people are gonna want
to set a background image,

2267
01:22:12,83 --> 01:22:17,10
and there's a beautiful gallery
of curated wallpapers to choose from.

2268
01:22:17,17 --> 01:22:21,04
You can use one of your own photos, too,
and I know I want a photo of my son.

2269
01:22:17,17 --> 01:22:21,04
You can use one of your own photos, too,
and I know I want a photo of my son.

2270
01:22:21,10 --> 01:22:23,87
I have a few really cute ones
here in the downloads.

2271
01:22:23,94 --> 01:22:26,21
I can just drag and drop to set it.

2272
01:22:23,94 --> 01:22:26,21
I can just drag and drop to set it.

2273
01:22:26,28 --> 01:22:27,88
That is so perfect.

2274
01:22:27,94 --> 01:22:30,45
You can add new sections
to the start page too.

2275
01:22:27,94 --> 01:22:30,45
You can add new sections
to the start page too.

2276
01:22:30,51 --> 01:22:34,32
Let's add iCloud Tabs and Reading List.

2277
01:22:34,38 --> 01:22:35,75
Let's take a look.

2278
01:22:35,82 --> 01:22:37,59
There. This is perfect.

2279
01:22:35,82 --> 01:22:37,59
There. This is perfect.

2280
01:22:37,65 --> 01:22:40,56
I use Reading List all the time,
and now it's so easy to get to.

2281
01:22:40,62 --> 01:22:44,03
Another way that you can dial in Safari
to suit your specific needs

2282
01:22:40,62 --> 01:22:44,03
Another way that you can dial in Safari
to suit your specific needs

2283
01:22:44,09 --> 01:22:45,46
is with extensions.

2284
01:22:45,53 --> 01:22:49,40
I can't wait for you developers
to bring your web extensions to Safari.

2285
01:22:45,53 --> 01:22:49,40
I can't wait for you developers
to bring your web extensions to Safari.

2286
01:22:49,46 --> 01:22:53,14
I've gone ahead and downloaded
a few web extensions to take a peek.

2287
01:22:53,20 --> 01:22:56,84
So let's go here to the Safari preferences
to enable them.

2288
01:22:53,20 --> 01:22:56,84
So let's go here to the Safari preferences
to enable them.

2289
01:22:56,91 --> 01:23:01,61
And I'll enable Power Thesaurus
and Recipe Filter.

2290
01:22:56,91 --> 01:23:01,61
And I'll enable Power Thesaurus
and Recipe Filter.

2291
01:23:01,68 --> 01:23:03,65
So each of the extensions
that I just enabled

2292
01:23:03,71 --> 01:23:05,65
now has its own button
here in the toolbar.

2293
01:23:05,71 --> 01:23:08,18
Let me show you Recipe Filter.
I love this one.

2294
01:23:05,71 --> 01:23:08,18
Let me show you Recipe Filter.
I love this one.

2295
01:23:08,25 --> 01:23:11,62
So this extension will search
the web page for a recipe,

2296
01:23:11,69 --> 01:23:14,39
and if it finds one,
it will pop it up in a little card.

2297
01:23:11,69 --> 01:23:14,39
and if it finds one,
it will pop it up in a little card.

2298
01:23:14,46 --> 01:23:17,83
It's been a great accelerator for me
when I'm building a grocery list.

2299
01:23:18,23 --> 01:23:22,33
So the extension hasn't done anything yet
because I haven't granted permission.

2300
01:23:22,40 --> 01:23:24,50
So let me click on the toolbar button,

2301
01:23:22,40 --> 01:23:24,50
So let me click on the toolbar button,

2302
01:23:24,57 --> 01:23:27,17
and I'm going to allow this extension
for one day.

2303
01:23:27,24 --> 01:23:28,97
And when I click here, it'll do its thing.

2304
01:23:29,04 --> 01:23:32,17
So here we go. And there it is. So useful.

2305
01:23:29,04 --> 01:23:32,17
So here we go. And there it is. So useful.

2306
01:23:32,24 --> 01:23:33,84
Okay, so I have my personality

2307
01:23:33,91 --> 01:23:36,68
pretty thoroughly stamped
over Safari at this point.

2308
01:23:33,91 --> 01:23:36,68
pretty thoroughly stamped
over Safari at this point.

2309
01:23:36,75 --> 01:23:39,35
And you know,
I use Safari for a lot of personal things,

2310
01:23:39,41 --> 01:23:42,62
and Apple makes sure
my private life stays private.

2311
01:23:39,41 --> 01:23:42,62
and Apple makes sure
my private life stays private.

2312
01:23:42,68 --> 01:23:46,96
Privacy is essential to everything we do
at Apple, and it's critical on the web.

2313
01:23:47,02 --> 01:23:49,89
And now you can see
what Safari is doing to protect you.

2314
01:23:47,02 --> 01:23:49,89
And now you can see
what Safari is doing to protect you.

2315
01:23:49,96 --> 01:23:52,76
If I click on the
Intelligent Tracking Prevention button,

2316
01:23:52,83 --> 01:23:54,50
I can see the number of known trackers

2317
01:23:52,83 --> 01:23:54,50
I can see the number of known trackers

2318
01:23:54,56 --> 01:23:57,53
that Safari protected me from
on this web page.

2319
01:23:57,60 --> 01:23:59,03
I can click here

2320
01:23:59,10 --> 01:24:03,04
to see a list of the known trackers
right here in this popover.

2321
01:23:59,10 --> 01:24:03,04
to see a list of the known trackers
right here in this popover.

2322
01:24:03,11 --> 01:24:05,84
And the full privacy report
is just one click away.

2323
01:24:06,58 --> 01:24:09,04
And that's what we have for privacy
in the new Safari.

2324
01:24:09,11 --> 01:24:11,01
Next I'd like to talk about tabs.

2325
01:24:11,08 --> 01:24:13,72
If you love tabs,
you're going to love the new Safari.

2326
01:24:11,08 --> 01:24:13,72
If you love tabs,
you're going to love the new Safari.

2327
01:24:13,78 --> 01:24:17,52
It's easier and more efficient than ever
to work with lots of tabs.

2328
01:24:17,59 --> 01:24:19,56
So I have another window here,

2329
01:24:17,59 --> 01:24:19,56
So I have another window here,

2330
01:24:19,62 --> 01:24:22,12
and right away you'll notice
that there are icons and tabs,

2331
01:24:22,19 --> 01:24:25,36
which makes it so easy
to spot what you're looking for.

2332
01:24:22,19 --> 01:24:25,36
which makes it so easy
to spot what you're looking for.

2333
01:24:25,43 --> 01:24:30,80
And if I open more tabs,
then you'll see more of them at once

2334
01:24:25,43 --> 01:24:30,80
And if I open more tabs,
then you'll see more of them at once

2335
01:24:30,87 --> 01:24:35,20
because the tabs get smaller
and use the space more efficiently.

2336
01:24:35,27 --> 01:24:38,01
If it's a little hard to find what
you're looking for with this many tabs,

2337
01:24:35,27 --> 01:24:38,01
If it's a little hard to find what
you're looking for with this many tabs,

2338
01:24:38,07 --> 01:24:39,21
that's no problem.

2339
01:24:39,27 --> 01:24:43,81
You can just hover over tabs
and see a nice preview of the page.

2340
01:24:39,27 --> 01:24:43,81
You can just hover over tabs
and see a nice preview of the page.

2341
01:24:44,68 --> 01:24:46,98
I'm ready to clean up now,
and that's easy too.

2342
01:24:47,05 --> 01:24:49,18
I can just bring up the context menu here

2343
01:24:47,05 --> 01:24:49,18
I can just bring up the context menu here

2344
01:24:49,25 --> 01:24:51,75
and close all tabs to the right.
Just like that.

2345
01:24:51,82 --> 01:24:55,72
We are so excited that
the new Safari has built-in translation.

2346
01:24:51,82 --> 01:24:55,72
We are so excited that
the new Safari has built-in translation.

2347
01:24:55,79 --> 01:24:56,79
Let me show you.

2348
01:24:57,59 --> 01:24:59,70
So here on this website, on <i>El Mundo</i>,

2349
01:24:59,76 --> 01:25:03,07
Safari has detected
that this is not in my primary language,

2350
01:24:59,76 --> 01:25:03,07
Safari has detected
that this is not in my primary language,

2351
01:25:03,13 --> 01:25:06,40
and it's added the translation icon
to the smart search field.

2352
01:25:03,13 --> 01:25:06,40
and it's added the translation icon
to the smart search field.

2353
01:25:06,47 --> 01:25:10,07
I can click here,
and let's translate this page to English.

2354
01:25:10,14 --> 01:25:11,61
It'll happen inline.

2355
01:25:12,07 --> 01:25:14,14
And as more content is added,

2356
01:25:14,21 --> 01:25:16,41
that gets translated dynamically too.

2357
01:25:17,61 --> 01:25:20,78
Those are some highlights, but there is
so much more to the new Safari.

2358
01:25:17,61 --> 01:25:20,78
Those are some highlights, but there is
so much more to the new Safari.

2359
01:25:20,85 --> 01:25:22,02
Back to you, Craig.

2360
01:25:22,08 --> 01:25:23,49
Thanks, Beth.

2361
01:25:23,55 --> 01:25:25,19
So that's Safari.

2362
01:25:23,55 --> 01:25:25,19
So that's Safari.

2363
01:25:25,25 --> 01:25:28,26
It's a huge release,
with new ways to customize,

2364
01:25:28,32 --> 01:25:30,26
big improvements
to your browsing experience

2365
01:25:28,32 --> 01:25:30,26
big improvements
to your browsing experience

2366
01:25:30,33 --> 01:25:32,16
like tabs and translation,

2367
01:25:32,23 --> 01:25:34,53
and even stronger privacy protection

2368
01:25:34,60 --> 01:25:37,57
to keep your browsing your business.

2369
01:25:34,60 --> 01:25:37,57
to keep your browsing your business.

2370
01:25:38,53 --> 01:25:40,20
And that's macOS Big Sur,

2371
01:25:40,27 --> 01:25:44,74
the biggest update to design since
the original introduction of Mac OS X,

2372
01:25:40,27 --> 01:25:44,74
the biggest update to design since
the original introduction of Mac OS X,

2373
01:25:44,81 --> 01:25:47,28
significant updates to Messages and Maps

2374
01:25:47,34 --> 01:25:50,68
and the biggest update to Safari ever.

2375
01:25:47,34 --> 01:25:50,68
and the biggest update to Safari ever.

2376
01:25:50,75 --> 01:25:53,08
But these changes are only the beginning.

2377
01:25:53,15 --> 01:25:56,45
For years now,
down deep, below the surface,

2378
01:25:53,15 --> 01:25:56,45
For years now,
down deep, below the surface,

2379
01:25:56,52 --> 01:25:59,42
we've been working
on something truly profound.

2380
01:25:59,49 --> 01:26:01,99
To tell you more,
I'll hand it back to Tim.

2381
01:25:59,49 --> 01:26:01,99
To tell you more,
I'll hand it back to Tim.

2382
01:26:03,79 --> 01:26:05,06
Thanks, Craig.

2383
01:26:05,13 --> 01:26:08,13
Big Sur is going to be
a great release of macOS.

2384
01:26:05,13 --> 01:26:08,13
Big Sur is going to be
a great release of macOS.

2385
01:26:08,20 --> 01:26:10,37
But that's only part of the story,

2386
01:26:10,43 --> 01:26:15,20
because today is going to be
a truly historic day for the Mac.

2387
01:26:10,43 --> 01:26:15,20
because today is going to be
a truly historic day for the Mac.

2388
01:26:15,27 --> 01:26:18,07
Today we're going to tell you
about some really big changes,

2389
01:26:15,27 --> 01:26:18,07
Today we're going to tell you
about some really big changes,

2390
01:26:18,14 --> 01:26:21,18
how we're going to take the Mac
to a whole new level.

2391
01:26:21,24 --> 01:26:22,58
From the very beginning,

2392
01:26:22,64 --> 01:26:25,85
the Mac redefined
the entire computer industry.

2393
01:26:22,64 --> 01:26:25,85
the Mac redefined
the entire computer industry.

2394
01:26:25,91 --> 01:26:30,25
The Mac has always been about innovation
and boldly pushing things forward,

2395
01:26:25,91 --> 01:26:30,25
The Mac has always been about innovation
and boldly pushing things forward,

2396
01:26:30,32 --> 01:26:33,92
embracing big changes to stay
at the forefront of personal computing.

2397
01:26:35,12 --> 01:26:38,19
The Mac has had
three major transitions in its history.

2398
01:26:35,12 --> 01:26:38,19
The Mac has had
three major transitions in its history.

2399
01:26:38,89 --> 01:26:40,70
The move to PowerPC,

2400
01:26:40,76 --> 01:26:43,07
the transition to Mac OS X

2401
01:26:40,76 --> 01:26:43,07
the transition to Mac OS X

2402
01:26:43,13 --> 01:26:45,23
and the move to Intel.

2403
01:26:45,30 --> 01:26:50,11
And now it's time
for a huge leap forward for the Mac,

2404
01:26:45,30 --> 01:26:50,11
And now it's time
for a huge leap forward for the Mac,

2405
01:26:50,17 --> 01:26:54,08
because today is the day we're announcing
that the Mac is transitioning...

2406
01:26:50,17 --> 01:26:54,08
because today is the day we're announcing
that the Mac is transitioning...

2407
01:26:58,98 --> 01:27:01,12
to our own Apple Silicon.

2408
01:26:58,98 --> 01:27:01,12
to our own Apple Silicon.

2409
01:27:02,38 --> 01:27:06,76
When we make bold changes,
it's for one simple yet powerful reason:

2410
01:27:02,38 --> 01:27:06,76
When we make bold changes,
it's for one simple yet powerful reason:

2411
01:27:06,82 --> 01:27:09,09
so we can make much better products.

2412
01:27:09,16 --> 01:27:12,29
When we look ahead,
we envision some amazing new products,

2413
01:27:09,16 --> 01:27:12,29
When we look ahead,
we envision some amazing new products,

2414
01:27:12,36 --> 01:27:15,00
and transitioning
to our own custom silicon

2415
01:27:15,06 --> 01:27:17,27
is what will enable us
to bring them to life.

2416
01:27:18,40 --> 01:27:19,60
At Apple,

2417
01:27:19,67 --> 01:27:24,17
integrating hardware and software
is fundamental to everything we do.

2418
01:27:19,67 --> 01:27:24,17
integrating hardware and software
is fundamental to everything we do.

2419
01:27:24,24 --> 01:27:26,21
That's what makes our products so great.

2420
01:27:26,28 --> 01:27:29,48
And silicon is at the heart
of our hardware.

2421
01:27:29,55 --> 01:27:32,25
So having a world-class
silicon design team

2422
01:27:29,55 --> 01:27:32,25
So having a world-class
silicon design team

2423
01:27:32,31 --> 01:27:33,55
is a game changer.

2424
01:27:34,55 --> 01:27:36,79
To tell you more about Apple Silicon

2425
01:27:34,55 --> 01:27:36,79
To tell you more about Apple Silicon

2426
01:27:36,85 --> 01:27:39,25
and how it will take Mac
to the next level,

2427
01:27:39,32 --> 01:27:42,49
I'd like to send you over to Johny Srouji

2428
01:27:39,32 --> 01:27:42,49
I'd like to send you over to Johny Srouji

2429
01:27:42,56 --> 01:27:45,69
at one of our labs
in an undisclosed location.

2430
01:27:46,53 --> 01:27:48,53
["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing]

2431
01:27:46,53 --> 01:27:48,53
["I'm Getting Tired"
by Jacknife Lee playing]

2432
01:28:10,59 --> 01:28:11,69
[song ends]

2433
01:28:11,75 --> 01:28:13,46
Welcome to our lab.

2434
01:28:11,75 --> 01:28:13,46
Welcome to our lab.

2435
01:28:13,52 --> 01:28:17,03
We've been building and refining
our Apple Silicon for over a decade.

2436
01:28:17,09 --> 01:28:18,99
The result is a scalable architecture

2437
01:28:17,09 --> 01:28:18,99
The result is a scalable architecture

2438
01:28:19,06 --> 01:28:21,23
that is custom-designed
for Apple products,

2439
01:28:21,30 --> 01:28:24,47
and it leads the industry in features
and performance per watt.

2440
01:28:21,30 --> 01:28:24,47
and it leads the industry in features
and performance per watt.

2441
01:28:24,53 --> 01:28:26,30
So I'd like to tell you how we got here

2442
01:28:26,37 --> 01:28:28,60
and what it means for the Mac
moving forward.

2443
01:28:28,67 --> 01:28:30,81
It all started with the iPhone.

2444
01:28:28,67 --> 01:28:30,81
It all started with the iPhone.

2445
01:28:30,87 --> 01:28:32,98
The iPhone demanded
performance and capabilities

2446
01:28:33,04 --> 01:28:35,91
that were seen as impossible
in a device that small.

2447
01:28:36,35 --> 01:28:40,18
This is where we developed our relentless
focus on performance per watt.

2448
01:28:41,05 --> 01:28:44,32
Generation after generation,
we pushed the boundaries of technology,

2449
01:28:41,05 --> 01:28:44,32
Generation after generation,
we pushed the boundaries of technology,

2450
01:28:44,39 --> 01:28:47,49
which enabled us to improve
performance and energy efficiency,

2451
01:28:47,56 --> 01:28:50,53
while building advanced
and industry-leading features.

2452
01:28:47,56 --> 01:28:50,53
while building advanced
and industry-leading features.

2453
01:28:50,59 --> 01:28:55,33
Our team delivered ten generations
of increasingly complex and rich designs,

2454
01:28:50,59 --> 01:28:55,33
Our team delivered ten generations
of increasingly complex and rich designs,

2455
01:28:55,40 --> 01:28:57,53
always improving performance.

2456
01:28:57,60 --> 01:28:59,90
In fact, CPU performance in the iPhone

2457
01:28:59,97 --> 01:29:02,14
has improved by over a hundred times,

2458
01:28:59,97 --> 01:29:02,14
has improved by over a hundred times,

2459
01:29:02,20 --> 01:29:06,18
keeping the iPhone's performance ahead
of every other phone in the industry.

2460
01:29:02,20 --> 01:29:06,18
keeping the iPhone's performance ahead
of every other phone in the industry.

2461
01:29:06,24 --> 01:29:09,14
Another opportunity for the team
was the iPad.

2462
01:29:09,21 --> 01:29:11,81
While iPhone chips
could drive our mainstream iPads,

2463
01:29:11,88 --> 01:29:14,05
we wanted to push the iPad even further.

2464
01:29:11,88 --> 01:29:14,05
we wanted to push the iPad even further.

2465
01:29:14,12 --> 01:29:16,42
It began with the iPad's Retina display,

2466
01:29:16,49 --> 01:29:18,69
which demanded a custom chip.

2467
01:29:16,49 --> 01:29:18,69
which demanded a custom chip.

2468
01:29:18,75 --> 01:29:20,49
So the team scaled our architecture

2469
01:29:20,56 --> 01:29:22,56
and designed the most-optimized

2470
01:29:22,62 --> 01:29:25,76
and highest-performance chip
possible for the iPad.

2471
01:29:22,62 --> 01:29:25,76
and highest-performance chip
possible for the iPad.

2472
01:29:25,83 --> 01:29:27,03
Starting with the A5X,

2473
01:29:27,10 --> 01:29:30,57
we built a line of SoCs
specifically designed for the iPad.

2474
01:29:27,10 --> 01:29:30,57
we built a line of SoCs
specifically designed for the iPad.

2475
01:29:30,63 --> 01:29:33,74
We doubled the iPhone's
graphics performance through a larger GPU

2476
01:29:33,80 --> 01:29:36,37
and a wider memory subsystem.

2477
01:29:33,80 --> 01:29:36,37
and a wider memory subsystem.

2478
01:29:36,44 --> 01:29:39,07
This put the iPad in a class by itself.

2479
01:29:39,14 --> 01:29:42,81
Compared to the very first iPad,
the latest iPad Pro delivers

2480
01:29:39,14 --> 01:29:42,81
Compared to the very first iPad,
the latest iPad Pro delivers

2481
01:29:42,88 --> 01:29:45,38
over 1,000 times faster
graphics performance

2482
01:29:45,45 --> 01:29:47,35
in just ten years.

2483
01:29:47,42 --> 01:29:50,15
This is part of the reason
why the iPad Pro is faster

2484
01:29:47,42 --> 01:29:50,15
This is part of the reason
why the iPad Pro is faster

2485
01:29:50,22 --> 01:29:53,22
than the vast majority of PC laptops.

2486
01:29:53,29 --> 01:29:57,69
And this foreshadows how well
our architecture will scale into the Mac.

2487
01:29:53,29 --> 01:29:57,69
And this foreshadows how well
our architecture will scale into the Mac.

2488
01:29:57,76 --> 01:30:01,16
Another place where we applied our focus
was the Watch.

2489
01:29:57,76 --> 01:30:01,16
Another place where we applied our focus
was the Watch.

2490
01:30:01,23 --> 01:30:04,17
We scaled our SoC architecture
to optimize performance

2491
01:30:04,23 --> 01:30:07,10
for the device's unique
low-power requirements,

2492
01:30:04,23 --> 01:30:07,10
for the device's unique
low-power requirements,

2493
01:30:07,17 --> 01:30:10,31
and we built a chip
perfectly suited for Apple Watch.

2494
01:30:11,34 --> 01:30:14,68
Our SoCs enable each of these products
with unique features

2495
01:30:11,34 --> 01:30:14,68
Our SoCs enable each of these products
with unique features

2496
01:30:14,74 --> 01:30:16,78
and industry-leading performance per watt,

2497
01:30:16,85 --> 01:30:19,62
and it makes each of them best in class.

2498
01:30:16,85 --> 01:30:19,62
and it makes each of them best in class.

2499
01:30:19,98 --> 01:30:22,68
And we do this at an enormous scale.

2500
01:30:22,75 --> 01:30:26,66
In fact, adding all of the processors
across these three products,

2501
01:30:22,75 --> 01:30:26,66
In fact, adding all of the processors
across these three products,

2502
01:30:26,72 --> 01:30:29,99
we've shipped over two billion
in just ten years.

2503
01:30:30,06 --> 01:30:32,83
And we've designed and shipped
billions of additional chips

2504
01:30:32,90 --> 01:30:34,53
that work together with our SoCs

2505
01:30:34,60 --> 01:30:36,53
to enable our amazing products.

2506
01:30:34,60 --> 01:30:36,53
to enable our amazing products.

2507
01:30:36,60 --> 01:30:39,13
And now we're bringing
all of that expertise

2508
01:30:39,20 --> 01:30:42,04
and that same focused
and disciplined approach

2509
01:30:39,20 --> 01:30:42,04
and that same focused
and disciplined approach

2510
01:30:42,10 --> 01:30:43,24
to the Mac.

2511
01:30:43,64 --> 01:30:47,34
The first thing this will do is give
the Mac a whole new level of performance.

2512
01:30:47,41 --> 01:30:50,98
Now, when we talk about performance,
we have to talk about power,

2513
01:30:47,41 --> 01:30:50,98
Now, when we talk about performance,
we have to talk about power,

2514
01:30:51,05 --> 01:30:54,55
because all systems built today
are constrained by power consumption,

2515
01:30:51,05 --> 01:30:54,55
because all systems built today
are constrained by power consumption,

2516
01:30:54,62 --> 01:30:55,98
thermals, or both.

2517
01:30:56,75 --> 01:30:58,75
Among today's consumer systems,

2518
01:30:58,82 --> 01:31:01,02
desktops deliver the highest performance

2519
01:30:58,82 --> 01:31:01,02
desktops deliver the highest performance

2520
01:31:01,09 --> 01:31:03,16
but consume the most power.

2521
01:31:03,23 --> 01:31:05,89
Notebooks trade off performance
for lower power,

2522
01:31:05,96 --> 01:31:07,60
making them portable.

2523
01:31:05,96 --> 01:31:07,60
making them portable.

2524
01:31:07,66 --> 01:31:09,93
As you can see,
normally to get more performance

2525
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:12,23
you have to consume more power.

2526
01:31:10,00 --> 01:31:12,23
you have to consume more power.

2527
01:31:12,30 --> 01:31:14,27
When you take a closer look at this chart,

2528
01:31:14,34 --> 01:31:17,74
you realize you want to operate
in the upper-left corner.

2529
01:31:17,81 --> 01:31:20,04
You want to deliver
the highest performance

2530
01:31:17,81 --> 01:31:20,04
You want to deliver
the highest performance

2531
01:31:20,11 --> 01:31:22,04
at the lowest power consumption.

2532
01:31:22,11 --> 01:31:24,61
And that's exactly
where we want to take the Mac.

2533
01:31:22,11 --> 01:31:24,61
And that's exactly
where we want to take the Mac.

2534
01:31:25,11 --> 01:31:26,95
Building up on our years of experience

2535
01:31:27,02 --> 01:31:29,79
designing the world's
most energy-efficient chips,

2536
01:31:29,85 --> 01:31:33,09
our plan is to give the Mac
a much higher level of performance

2537
01:31:29,85 --> 01:31:33,09
our plan is to give the Mac
a much higher level of performance

2538
01:31:33,16 --> 01:31:36,16
while at the same time
consuming less power.

2539
01:31:33,16 --> 01:31:36,16
while at the same time
consuming less power.

2540
01:31:36,23 --> 01:31:38,33
So, much better performance
is reason enough

2541
01:31:38,39 --> 01:31:40,53
to transition the Mac to Apple SoCs.

2542
01:31:41,30 --> 01:31:43,27
But that's just part of the story.

2543
01:31:41,30 --> 01:31:43,27
But that's just part of the story.

2544
01:31:44,07 --> 01:31:47,30
Our scalable architecture includes
many custom technologies

2545
01:31:47,37 --> 01:31:49,44
that when integrated with our software

2546
01:31:47,37 --> 01:31:49,44
that when integrated with our software

2547
01:31:49,51 --> 01:31:51,91
will bring even more innovation
to the Mac.

2548
01:31:52,64 --> 01:31:54,31
With our advanced power management,

2549
01:31:52,64 --> 01:31:54,31
With our advanced power management,

2550
01:31:54,38 --> 01:31:56,98
we will maximize performance
and battery life

2551
01:31:57,05 --> 01:31:58,71
better than ever before.

2552
01:31:59,52 --> 01:32:02,92
Our Secure Enclave will bring
best-in-class security,

2553
01:31:59,52 --> 01:32:02,92
Our Secure Enclave will bring
best-in-class security,

2554
01:32:02,99 --> 01:32:04,52
and our high-performance GPU

2555
01:32:04,59 --> 01:32:08,42
is going to bring a whole new level
of graphics performance to every Mac,

2556
01:32:04,59 --> 01:32:08,42
is going to bring a whole new level
of graphics performance to every Mac,

2557
01:32:08,49 --> 01:32:10,83
making them even better
for Pro Applications

2558
01:32:10,89 --> 01:32:12,43
and really great for games.

2559
01:32:10,89 --> 01:32:12,43
and really great for games.

2560
01:32:12,49 --> 01:32:14,66
And combined with our neural engines,

2561
01:32:14,73 --> 01:32:18,67
our chips will make the Mac
an amazing platform for machine learning.

2562
01:32:14,73 --> 01:32:18,67
our chips will make the Mac
an amazing platform for machine learning.

2563
01:32:18,73 --> 01:32:21,07
And we're bringing
many other custom technologies,

2564
01:32:21,14 --> 01:32:24,54
such as our video-display
and image-processing engines,

2565
01:32:21,14 --> 01:32:24,54
such as our video-display
and image-processing engines,

2566
01:32:24,61 --> 01:32:27,41
that will help make the Mac
better than ever before.

2567
01:32:28,01 --> 01:32:29,95
So, what does all of this mean
for the Mac?

2568
01:32:30,01 --> 01:32:34,42
First, we're designing a family of SoCs
specifically for the Mac product line.

2569
01:32:34,48 --> 01:32:37,39
Second, just like we did
with the iPhone, iPad and Watch,

2570
01:32:34,48 --> 01:32:37,39
Second, just like we did
with the iPhone, iPad and Watch,

2571
01:32:37,45 --> 01:32:40,22
we're going to bring
great technologies to the Mac.

2572
01:32:40,29 --> 01:32:42,69
This will give the Mac
a unique set of features

2573
01:32:40,29 --> 01:32:42,69
This will give the Mac
a unique set of features

2574
01:32:42,76 --> 01:32:44,83
and incredible performance.

2575
01:32:44,89 --> 01:32:47,03
And third, we'll have
a common architecture

2576
01:32:47,10 --> 01:32:49,80
across all of our product lines,

2577
01:32:47,10 --> 01:32:49,80
across all of our product lines,

2578
01:32:49,87 --> 01:32:53,14
making it far easier for developers
to write and optimize software

2579
01:32:53,20 --> 01:32:55,37
for the entire Apple ecosystem.

2580
01:32:53,20 --> 01:32:55,37
for the entire Apple ecosystem.

2581
01:32:55,44 --> 01:32:58,51
Ultimately we know
that bringing our SoCs to the Mac

2582
01:32:58,57 --> 01:33:01,74
will allow us to build
much better products,

2583
01:32:58,57 --> 01:33:01,74
will allow us to build
much better products,

2584
01:33:01,81 --> 01:33:04,78
and the Mac will take
another huge leap forward.

2585
01:33:04,85 --> 01:33:06,65
Now, a key advantage we have

2586
01:33:04,85 --> 01:33:06,65
Now, a key advantage we have

2587
01:33:06,72 --> 01:33:10,05
is the tight integration
of our silicon with our software.

2588
01:33:10,12 --> 01:33:13,36
To tell you more about
how macOS will run on Apple SoCs,

2589
01:33:10,12 --> 01:33:13,36
To tell you more about
how macOS will run on Apple SoCs,

2590
01:33:13,42 --> 01:33:15,29
here is my colleague, Craig.

2591
01:33:17,36 --> 01:33:18,43
Thanks, Johny.

2592
01:33:17,36 --> 01:33:18,43
Thanks, Johny.

2593
01:33:18,49 --> 01:33:22,87
Now let's talk about the technologies
that we've built into macOS Big Sur

2594
01:33:22,93 --> 01:33:26,44
that will make the transition
to Apple Silicon smooth and seamless

2595
01:33:22,93 --> 01:33:26,44
that will make the transition
to Apple Silicon smooth and seamless

2596
01:33:26,50 --> 01:33:29,17
for both consumers and developers.

2597
01:33:29,24 --> 01:33:32,14
These new Mac systems will be incredible,

2598
01:33:29,24 --> 01:33:32,14
These new Mac systems will be incredible,

2599
01:33:32,21 --> 01:33:33,98
and users will want their favorite apps

2600
01:33:34,04 --> 01:33:37,45
to take full advantage of the capabilities
of our custom silicon.

2601
01:33:34,04 --> 01:33:37,45
to take full advantage of the capabilities
of our custom silicon.

2602
01:33:37,51 --> 01:33:40,52
And the best way to do that
is with native apps.

2603
01:33:40,58 --> 01:33:43,15
So of course when we updated
our apps for Big Sur,

2604
01:33:40,58 --> 01:33:43,15
So of course when we updated
our apps for Big Sur,

2605
01:33:43,22 --> 01:33:47,36
we built everything as native
for Apple Silicon.

2606
01:33:47,42 --> 01:33:50,36
And I'm happy to say we have
all of our own Apple apps,

2607
01:33:47,42 --> 01:33:50,36
And I'm happy to say we have
all of our own Apple apps,

2608
01:33:50,43 --> 01:33:54,80
including our most demanding Pro Apps
like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro,

2609
01:33:50,43 --> 01:33:54,80
including our most demanding Pro Apps
like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro,

2610
01:33:54,86 --> 01:33:57,07
up and running as native now,

2611
01:33:57,13 --> 01:34:00,30
and they'll be ready for customers
on day one.

2612
01:33:57,13 --> 01:34:00,30
and they'll be ready for customers
on day one.

2613
01:34:00,37 --> 01:34:01,90
So, how did we do this?

2614
01:34:01,97 --> 01:34:05,14
We're using Xcode,
just like all our developers will.

2615
01:34:05,21 --> 01:34:08,24
Everything developers need
to build apps for these new chips

2616
01:34:05,21 --> 01:34:08,24
Everything developers need
to build apps for these new chips

2617
01:34:08,31 --> 01:34:11,05
is built into the new version of Xcode.

2618
01:34:11,11 --> 01:34:15,18
To get started, developers just open
their app projects and recompile.

2619
01:34:11,11 --> 01:34:15,18
To get started, developers just open
their app projects and recompile.

2620
01:34:15,25 --> 01:34:18,55
The vast majority of developers
can get their apps up and running

2621
01:34:15,25 --> 01:34:18,55
The vast majority of developers
can get their apps up and running

2622
01:34:18,62 --> 01:34:21,16
in just a matter of days.

2623
01:34:21,22 --> 01:34:23,09
And to deliver these apps,

2624
01:34:23,16 --> 01:34:24,86
we've created Universal 2.

2625
01:34:23,16 --> 01:34:24,86
we've created Universal 2.

2626
01:34:24,93 --> 01:34:26,56
It's a new type of Universal binary

2627
01:34:26,63 --> 01:34:30,90
that works on both Intel-based Macs
and Macs built on Apple Silicon.

2628
01:34:26,63 --> 01:34:30,90
that works on both Intel-based Macs
and Macs built on Apple Silicon.

2629
01:34:31,40 --> 01:34:35,37
So developers can tap into the native
power and performance of our new Macs

2630
01:34:35,44 --> 01:34:37,91
and still support Intel-based Macs,

2631
01:34:35,44 --> 01:34:37,91
and still support Intel-based Macs,

2632
01:34:37,97 --> 01:34:41,11
all with a single binary
for all of their users.

2633
01:34:41,18 --> 01:34:44,41
Some of the biggest Mac developers
have already gotten started.

2634
01:34:41,18 --> 01:34:44,41
Some of the biggest Mac developers
have already gotten started.

2635
01:34:44,48 --> 01:34:47,45
Microsoft is hard at work
on Office for the Mac.

2636
01:34:47,52 --> 01:34:49,48
And we've been working with Adobe

2637
01:34:47,52 --> 01:34:49,48
And we've been working with Adobe

2638
01:34:49,55 --> 01:34:51,29
on their flagship Creative Cloud,

2639
01:34:51,35 --> 01:34:55,12
and many of their apps
are already up and running great.

2640
01:34:51,35 --> 01:34:55,12
and many of their apps
are already up and running great.

2641
01:34:55,69 --> 01:34:59,33
So let's take a look at macOS
running on Apple Silicon.

2642
01:34:59,39 --> 01:35:03,30
So here we are on the desktop
that we know and love.

2643
01:34:59,39 --> 01:35:03,30
So here we are on the desktop
that we know and love.

2644
01:35:03,37 --> 01:35:06,03
And I'm just gonna open up About This Mac.

2645
01:35:03,37 --> 01:35:06,03
And I'm just gonna open up About This Mac.

2646
01:35:06,94 --> 01:35:11,74
And what you see here is that we are
running on our Apple Development Platform.

2647
01:35:11,81 --> 01:35:14,14
This is a system built
to support early development

2648
01:35:11,81 --> 01:35:14,14
This is a system built
to support early development

2649
01:35:14,21 --> 01:35:16,61
using the same A12Z processor

2650
01:35:16,68 --> 01:35:19,21
currently shipping in iPad Pro.

2651
01:35:16,68 --> 01:35:19,21
currently shipping in iPad Pro.

2652
01:35:19,28 --> 01:35:21,05
Now, I have a confession to make.

2653
01:35:21,12 --> 01:35:24,35
This isn't the first time
you've seen macOS running here.

2654
01:35:21,12 --> 01:35:24,35
This isn't the first time
you've seen macOS running here.

2655
01:35:24,42 --> 01:35:26,42
In fact, this is the same Mac

2656
01:35:26,49 --> 01:35:30,59
that Beth and I used to demo
all the new Big Sur features earlier.

2657
01:35:26,49 --> 01:35:30,59
that Beth and I used to demo
all the new Big Sur features earlier.

2658
01:35:31,13 --> 01:35:32,66
And as you saw earlier,

2659
01:35:32,73 --> 01:35:35,06
we've updated all of our Apple apps

2660
01:35:35,13 --> 01:35:37,10
and they're running great.

2661
01:35:35,13 --> 01:35:37,10
and they're running great.

2662
01:35:37,17 --> 01:35:40,97
Of course, a big part
of the Mac experience is third-party apps,

2663
01:35:41,04 --> 01:35:43,57
and we've been working
with our friends at Microsoft,

2664
01:35:41,04 --> 01:35:43,57
and we've been working
with our friends at Microsoft,

2665
01:35:43,64 --> 01:35:47,44
and they already have Office
up and running natively on our new Macs.

2666
01:35:47,78 --> 01:35:49,28
Let's take a look at Word.

2667
01:35:47,78 --> 01:35:49,28
Let's take a look at Word.

2668
01:35:49,34 --> 01:35:50,71
It runs great.

2669
01:35:50,78 --> 01:35:53,28
Scrolling is super smooth.

2670
01:35:53,35 --> 01:35:56,92
Everything you do
is just super responsive.

2671
01:35:53,35 --> 01:35:56,92
Everything you do
is just super responsive.

2672
01:35:57,32 --> 01:35:59,92
Next let's check out Excel.

2673
01:36:00,79 --> 01:36:04,89
Just as you'd expect,
complex sheets and elements like this map

2674
01:36:04,96 --> 01:36:07,30
all update instantly.

2675
01:36:04,96 --> 01:36:07,30
all update instantly.

2676
01:36:07,36 --> 01:36:10,20
And next let's take a look at PowerPoint.

2677
01:36:10,27 --> 01:36:14,44
It's using Metal for rendering,
and it performs great.

2678
01:36:10,27 --> 01:36:14,44
It's using Metal for rendering,
and it performs great.

2679
01:36:14,50 --> 01:36:19,31
For instance, check out how I can see
all the layers of my slide in 3D.

2680
01:36:14,50 --> 01:36:19,31
For instance, check out how I can see
all the layers of my slide in 3D.

2681
01:36:19,37 --> 01:36:22,01
The animation is perfectly fluid.

2682
01:36:22,44 --> 01:36:25,45
Now, we've also been working closely
with our friends at Adobe

2683
01:36:22,44 --> 01:36:25,45
Now, we've also been working closely
with our friends at Adobe

2684
01:36:25,51 --> 01:36:27,98
to bring Creative Cloud to our new Macs.

2685
01:36:28,48 --> 01:36:31,49
Here's Lightroom
running native on Apple Silicon.

2686
01:36:28,48 --> 01:36:31,49
Here's Lightroom
running native on Apple Silicon.

2687
01:36:31,99 --> 01:36:37,23
Navigating large libraries of DNG images
is super fast,

2688
01:36:31,99 --> 01:36:37,23
Navigating large libraries of DNG images
is super fast,

2689
01:36:37,29 --> 01:36:41,46
and all of Lightroom's editing controls
are available right here.

2690
01:36:41,53 --> 01:36:43,73
Let's apply an adjustment to this image.

2691
01:36:41,53 --> 01:36:43,73
Let's apply an adjustment to this image.

2692
01:36:43,80 --> 01:36:44,83
Well, that's much better.

2693
01:36:44,90 --> 01:36:50,14
And we can apply that same edit
to all of these images in a single step.

2694
01:36:44,90 --> 01:36:50,14
And we can apply that same edit
to all of these images in a single step.

2695
01:36:51,41 --> 01:36:52,71
Looks great.

2696
01:36:52,77 --> 01:36:56,04
Next, let me show you the app
I know many of you wanna see:

2697
01:36:52,77 --> 01:36:56,04
Next, let me show you the app
I know many of you wanna see:

2698
01:36:56,11 --> 01:36:57,48
Photoshop.

2699
01:36:57,55 --> 01:37:02,25
Here is a five-gigabyte Photoshop file
by photographer Stephen Wilkes.

2700
01:36:57,55 --> 01:37:02,25
Here is a five-gigabyte Photoshop file
by photographer Stephen Wilkes.

2701
01:37:02,32 --> 01:37:06,79
Now this is a heavy-duty document
with lots of layers.

2702
01:37:02,32 --> 01:37:06,79
Now this is a heavy-duty document
with lots of layers.

2703
01:37:06,86 --> 01:37:09,46
Now let's add one more bird in there.

2704
01:37:10,99 --> 01:37:14,80
Not totally comfortable with the level of
social distancing, but let's keep going.

2705
01:37:10,99 --> 01:37:14,80
Not totally comfortable with the level of
social distancing, but let's keep going.

2706
01:37:15,16 --> 01:37:19,30
And let's check out
how smooth the animation is as I zoom out.

2707
01:37:15,16 --> 01:37:19,30
And let's check out
how smooth the animation is as I zoom out.

2708
01:37:20,50 --> 01:37:22,17
Wow. Beautiful.

2709
01:37:22,80 --> 01:37:26,01
Finally, let's turn to
one of our most sophisticated apps:

2710
01:37:22,80 --> 01:37:26,01
Finally, let's turn to
one of our most sophisticated apps:

2711
01:37:26,07 --> 01:37:27,41
Final Cut Pro.

2712
01:37:27,48 --> 01:37:30,58
Here it is running on Apple Silicon
for the first time.

2713
01:37:27,48 --> 01:37:30,58
Here it is running on Apple Silicon
for the first time.

2714
01:37:30,65 --> 01:37:32,95
Let's play back some 4K video.

2715
01:37:33,02 --> 01:37:36,12
As you can see, playback is super smooth.

2716
01:37:33,02 --> 01:37:36,12
As you can see, playback is super smooth.

2717
01:37:36,19 --> 01:37:39,25
And all your filters are here,
and you can apply them in real time.

2718
01:37:40,06 --> 01:37:41,92
Let's try some color correction.

2719
01:37:41,99 --> 01:37:46,06
And I can even add
animated titles and lens flare...

2720
01:37:41,99 --> 01:37:46,06
And I can even add
animated titles and lens flare...

2721
01:37:46,80 --> 01:37:48,76
all during live playback.

2722
01:37:46,80 --> 01:37:48,76
all during live playback.

2723
01:37:48,83 --> 01:37:50,27
And Final Cut takes advantage

2724
01:37:50,33 --> 01:37:52,80
of the unique capabilities
of the Apple Neural Engine

2725
01:37:52,87 --> 01:37:56,61
with a new feature that analyzes video
and intelligently crops it

2726
01:37:52,87 --> 01:37:56,61
with a new feature that analyzes video
and intelligently crops it

2727
01:37:56,67 --> 01:37:59,27
to keep the most important action
in the frame.

2728
01:37:59,34 --> 01:38:00,81
But that's not all.

2729
01:37:59,34 --> 01:38:00,81
But that's not all.

2730
01:38:00,88 --> 01:38:04,51
Final Cut fully exploits
the system's multicore architecture

2731
01:38:04,58 --> 01:38:08,18
to let us play back not just one or two,
but three streams

2732
01:38:04,58 --> 01:38:08,18
to let us play back not just one or two,
but three streams

2733
01:38:08,25 --> 01:38:13,69
of full-resolution 4K ProRes,
all on an A12Z processor.

2734
01:38:08,25 --> 01:38:13,69
of full-resolution 4K ProRes,
all on an A12Z processor.

2735
01:38:13,76 --> 01:38:14,82
Amazing.

2736
01:38:15,16 --> 01:38:18,93
So that's a first look
at Universal apps on Apple Silicon.

2737
01:38:15,16 --> 01:38:18,93
So that's a first look
at Universal apps on Apple Silicon.

2738
01:38:19,80 --> 01:38:23,27
We're really excited to see
so much great work on native apps.

2739
01:38:23,83 --> 01:38:26,77
These apps even get more amazing
when they're built to take advantage of

2740
01:38:23,83 --> 01:38:26,77
These apps even get more amazing
when they're built to take advantage of

2741
01:38:26,84 --> 01:38:28,77
the Silicon's powerful capabilities.

2742
01:38:29,10 --> 01:38:31,84
Like its incredible
CPU and graphics performance,

2743
01:38:29,10 --> 01:38:31,84
Like its incredible
CPU and graphics performance,

2744
01:38:31,91 --> 01:38:34,94
a unified memory architecture
and the Neural Engine

2745
01:38:35,01 --> 01:38:37,68
which accelerates
advanced machine-learning tasks.

2746
01:38:35,01 --> 01:38:37,68
which accelerates
advanced machine-learning tasks.

2747
01:38:37,75 --> 01:38:40,62
The transition to Apple Silicon
is also great for developers

2748
01:38:40,68 --> 01:38:44,12
who've already optimized their apps
for other Apple platforms.

2749
01:38:40,68 --> 01:38:44,12
who've already optimized their apps
for other Apple platforms.

2750
01:38:44,19 --> 01:38:46,05
The shared architecture
across our products

2751
01:38:46,12 --> 01:38:49,99
means that their code
will absolutely sing on our new Macs.

2752
01:38:46,12 --> 01:38:49,99
means that their code
will absolutely sing on our new Macs.

2753
01:38:50,69 --> 01:38:52,33
And there's even more to the story.

2754
01:38:52,39 --> 01:38:53,93
We're doing some really important things

2755
01:38:54,00 --> 01:38:56,47
to make this transition
seamless for our users.

2756
01:38:57,23 --> 01:39:00,40
Now, while we expect most developers
will go native immediately,

2757
01:38:57,23 --> 01:39:00,40
Now, while we expect most developers
will go native immediately,

2758
01:39:00,47 --> 01:39:04,07
we wanna make sure that users
can run all of their apps on day one,

2759
01:39:04,14 --> 01:39:06,51
even if some apps
haven't yet been updated.

2760
01:39:04,14 --> 01:39:06,51
even if some apps
haven't yet been updated.

2761
01:39:07,21 --> 01:39:09,41
Now, we've been down this road before.

2762
01:39:09,48 --> 01:39:12,45
When we transitioned
from PowerPC to Intel processors,

2763
01:39:09,48 --> 01:39:12,45
When we transitioned
from PowerPC to Intel processors,

2764
01:39:12,51 --> 01:39:15,82
a cornerstone of that transition
was Rosetta,

2765
01:39:15,88 --> 01:39:20,66
a technology that makes it possible
to run PowerPC apps on Intel-based Macs.

2766
01:39:15,88 --> 01:39:20,66
a technology that makes it possible
to run PowerPC apps on Intel-based Macs.

2767
01:39:21,16 --> 01:39:25,66
macOS Big Sur will include
a new version of Rosetta, Rosetta 2.

2768
01:39:21,16 --> 01:39:25,66
macOS Big Sur will include
a new version of Rosetta, Rosetta 2.

2769
01:39:25,73 --> 01:39:28,86
Rosetta 2 automatically
translates your existing Mac apps

2770
01:39:28,93 --> 01:39:31,43
so they work on new Macs
with Apple Silicon.

2771
01:39:28,93 --> 01:39:31,43
so they work on new Macs
with Apple Silicon.

2772
01:39:31,93 --> 01:39:37,41
And this time Rosetta is even faster,
more powerful and more compatible.

2773
01:39:31,93 --> 01:39:37,41
And this time Rosetta is even faster,
more powerful and more compatible.

2774
01:39:37,47 --> 01:39:39,91
It translates the apps
when you install them,

2775
01:39:39,98 --> 01:39:42,98
so they can launch immediately
and be instantly responsive.

2776
01:39:39,98 --> 01:39:42,98
so they can launch immediately
and be instantly responsive.

2777
01:39:43,41 --> 01:39:47,28
And Rosetta 2 can also
translate code on the fly when needed,

2778
01:39:47,35 --> 01:39:51,25
like for web browsers with just-in-time
JavaScript compilers or for Java code.

2779
01:39:47,35 --> 01:39:51,25
like for web browsers with just-in-time
JavaScript compilers or for Java code.

2780
01:39:51,62 --> 01:39:55,46
It even handles the most complex
Pro Apps and their plug-ins.

2781
01:39:51,62 --> 01:39:55,46
It even handles the most complex
Pro Apps and their plug-ins.

2782
01:39:56,06 --> 01:40:00,20
Rosetta 2 is transparent to users,
and the performance is amazing.

2783
01:39:56,06 --> 01:40:00,20
Rosetta 2 is transparent to users,
and the performance is amazing.

2784
01:40:00,70 --> 01:40:05,00
We're also introducing new Virtualization
technologies in macOS Big Sur.

2785
01:40:05,40 --> 01:40:08,57
So, for developers who wanna run
other environments like Linux

2786
01:40:05,40 --> 01:40:08,57
So, for developers who wanna run
other environments like Linux

2787
01:40:08,64 --> 01:40:11,37
or tools like Docker, we have you covered.

2788
01:40:11,97 --> 01:40:14,18
When you put
all of these technologies together,

2789
01:40:11,97 --> 01:40:14,18
When you put
all of these technologies together,

2790
01:40:14,51 --> 01:40:17,71
Universal, Rosetta and Virtualization,

2791
01:40:17,78 --> 01:40:21,02
you have a system that can run
an amazing diversity of apps.

2792
01:40:17,78 --> 01:40:21,02
you have a system that can run
an amazing diversity of apps.

2793
01:40:21,68 --> 01:40:25,12
To show you how this all comes together,
I'll hand it over to Andreas Wendker.

2794
01:40:21,68 --> 01:40:25,12
To show you how this all comes together,
I'll hand it over to Andreas Wendker.

2795
01:40:28,22 --> 01:40:29,16
Thanks, Craig.

2796
01:40:29,63 --> 01:40:32,43
Let's take a look at some existing apps
running under Rosetta.

2797
01:40:29,63 --> 01:40:32,43
Let's take a look at some existing apps
running under Rosetta.

2798
01:40:32,49 --> 01:40:35,76
Rosetta, of course, works great with
all sorts of apps you use every day.

2799
01:40:35,83 --> 01:40:39,20
But for our first demo, I'd like to
show you something a bit more challenging.

2800
01:40:35,83 --> 01:40:39,20
But for our first demo, I'd like to
show you something a bit more challenging.

2801
01:40:39,27 --> 01:40:42,30
This is Maya, the powerful animation
and modeling software

2802
01:40:39,27 --> 01:40:42,30
This is Maya, the powerful animation
and modeling software

2803
01:40:42,37 --> 01:40:44,01
running great here on Apple Silicon.

2804
01:40:44,57 --> 01:40:48,18
I already have a model open that consists
of over six million polygons

2805
01:40:44,57 --> 01:40:48,18
I already have a model open that consists
of over six million polygons

2806
01:40:48,24 --> 01:40:51,55
and, as you can see,
I can fluidly move around in this scene.

2807
01:40:51,61 --> 01:40:54,88
So let's make it more challenging
and bring in textures and shaders as well.

2808
01:40:51,61 --> 01:40:54,88
So let's make it more challenging
and bring in textures and shaders as well.

2809
01:40:55,68 --> 01:40:58,59
And still, everything is incredibly fluid.

2810
01:40:59,25 --> 01:41:03,36
So Rosetta works great,
and the performance is simply fantastic.

2811
01:40:59,25 --> 01:41:03,36
So Rosetta works great,
and the performance is simply fantastic.

2812
01:41:03,43 --> 01:41:04,76
But Rosetta isn't just for apps.

2813
01:41:04,83 --> 01:41:06,83
It also works amazingly well with games.

2814
01:41:04,83 --> 01:41:06,83
It also works amazingly well with games.

2815
01:41:06,90 --> 01:41:08,76
I can even use a game controller.

2816
01:41:09,73 --> 01:41:11,40
This is <i>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</i>,

2817
01:41:11,47 --> 01:41:14,77
a high-end AAA game
that's using our Metal APIs.

2818
01:41:11,47 --> 01:41:14,77
a high-end AAA game
that's using our Metal APIs.

2819
01:41:15,24 --> 01:41:17,37
I downloaded it directly from
the Mac App Store,

2820
01:41:17,44 --> 01:41:19,07
so it's completely unmodified,

2821
01:41:17,44 --> 01:41:19,07
so it's completely unmodified,

2822
01:41:19,14 --> 01:41:20,81
and it is absolutely beautiful.

2823
01:41:21,84 --> 01:41:23,35
Let me jump into the water.

2824
01:41:24,35 --> 01:41:26,35
You can see
some of the lighting effects here.

2825
01:41:30,85 --> 01:41:33,86
And as I follow the path,
you can see the game is responsive,

2826
01:41:34,42 --> 01:41:35,49
it's smooth,

2827
01:41:36,26 --> 01:41:39,66
and the best part is, you're running
the 1080p as a translated app

2828
01:41:39,73 --> 01:41:41,26
and an emulation.

2829
01:41:41,33 --> 01:41:43,43
So these new Macs, they are fast.

2830
01:41:41,33 --> 01:41:43,43
So these new Macs, they are fast.

2831
01:41:44,33 --> 01:41:46,54
You can see
some more of the lighting effects here.

2832
01:41:47,34 --> 01:41:50,67
It's awesome what Rosetta can do
with existing games.

2833
01:41:47,34 --> 01:41:50,67
It's awesome what Rosetta can do
with existing games.

2834
01:41:51,44 --> 01:41:54,98
Now, as Craig mentioned, many of our users
rely on apps from other environments.

2835
01:41:51,44 --> 01:41:54,98
Now, as Craig mentioned, many of our users
rely on apps from other environments.

2836
01:41:55,04 --> 01:41:58,01
So let me bring up a Linux VM
in Parallels Desktop.

2837
01:41:58,55 --> 01:42:01,52
You can see the graphical user interface
designed for Linux here.

2838
01:41:58,55 --> 01:42:01,52
You can see the graphical user interface
designed for Linux here.

2839
01:42:01,58 --> 01:42:05,25
But, of course, many developers
like to use Linux for hosting servers.

2840
01:42:05,32 --> 01:42:08,72
So let me dive down to the command line
and launch in Apache Web Server.

2841
01:42:05,32 --> 01:42:08,72
So let me dive down to the command line
and launch in Apache Web Server.

2842
01:42:09,53 --> 01:42:11,86
And now I can simply bring up Safari

2843
01:42:11,93 --> 01:42:15,40
and browse the website of the server
I just launched in the Linux VM.

2844
01:42:11,93 --> 01:42:15,40
and browse the website of the server
I just launched in the Linux VM.

2845
01:42:15,46 --> 01:42:16,83
Here it is.

2846
01:42:16,90 --> 01:42:19,70
Now I want to show you one more
type of app to run on these new Macs

2847
01:42:16,90 --> 01:42:19,70
Now I want to show you one more
type of app to run on these new Macs

2848
01:42:19,77 --> 01:42:21,17
that we haven't even told you about yet,

2849
01:42:21,24 --> 01:42:23,94
and that is iPhone and iPad apps.

2850
01:42:24,01 --> 01:42:26,21
Since they've been built
to run on the same Apple Silicon

2851
01:42:26,28 --> 01:42:27,64
that we're using on our new Macs,

2852
01:42:27,71 --> 01:42:29,91
they will run natively,
completely unmodified,

2853
01:42:29,98 --> 01:42:31,41
on the new Macs as well.

2854
01:42:29,98 --> 01:42:31,41
on the new Macs as well.

2855
01:42:31,48 --> 01:42:33,25
Let me show you a few.

2856
01:42:33,32 --> 01:42:36,25
This here is one of my favorite games,
<i>Monument Valley 2.</i>

2857
01:42:33,32 --> 01:42:36,25
This here is one of my favorite games,
<i>Monument Valley 2.</i>

2858
01:42:36,32 --> 01:42:38,22
It's fun to play here on the new Mac.

2859
01:42:39,05 --> 01:42:42,16
And if I want to catch up on my
guitar lessons, I can use Fender Play.

2860
01:42:39,05 --> 01:42:42,16
And if I want to catch up on my
guitar lessons, I can use Fender Play.

2861
01:42:42,22 --> 01:42:44,63
[guitar plays]

2862
01:42:45,46 --> 01:42:47,86
Or if I want to relax
at the end of the day a little bit,

2863
01:42:47,93 --> 01:42:49,40
I can bring up the Calm app.

2864
01:42:47,93 --> 01:42:49,40
I can bring up the Calm app.

2865
01:42:51,33 --> 01:42:54,20
And that was just a quick look
at Rosetta, Virtualization

2866
01:42:51,33 --> 01:42:54,20
And that was just a quick look
at Rosetta, Virtualization

2867
01:42:54,27 --> 01:42:57,94
and support for iPhone and iPad apps,
giving users amazing versatility

2868
01:42:58,01 --> 01:43:01,44
for running apps and other environments
with macOS on Apple Silicon.

2869
01:42:58,01 --> 01:43:01,44
for running apps and other environments
with macOS on Apple Silicon.

2870
01:43:01,51 --> 01:43:02,58
Back to you, Craig.

2871
01:43:04,51 --> 01:43:05,51
Thanks, Andreas.

2872
01:43:05,91 --> 01:43:06,92
As you saw,

2873
01:43:05,91 --> 01:43:06,92
As you saw,

2874
01:43:06,98 --> 01:43:11,75
Macs built with Apple Silicon will be able
to run iPhone and iPad apps directly.

2875
01:43:12,29 --> 01:43:16,69
Starting day one, users can download
these apps right from the Mac App Store,

2876
01:43:16,76 --> 01:43:20,40
and most apps will just work
with no changes from the developer.

2877
01:43:16,76 --> 01:43:20,40
and most apps will just work
with no changes from the developer.

2878
01:43:21,06 --> 01:43:22,33
With everything we're doing,

2879
01:43:22,40 --> 01:43:25,27
the range of apps that users
will be able to run on these new Macs

2880
01:43:22,40 --> 01:43:25,27
the range of apps that users
will be able to run on these new Macs

2881
01:43:25,33 --> 01:43:27,47
is truly unprecedented.

2882
01:43:27,54 --> 01:43:31,97
Together, we have all the technologies in
place to make this an amazing transition.

2883
01:43:27,54 --> 01:43:31,97
Together, we have all the technologies in
place to make this an amazing transition.

2884
01:43:32,04 --> 01:43:33,54
The vast majority of Mac apps

2885
01:43:33,61 --> 01:43:36,45
can be recompiled as Universal
in a few days,

2886
01:43:33,61 --> 01:43:36,45
can be recompiled as Universal
in a few days,

2887
01:43:36,51 --> 01:43:39,18
so users can have fast, native apps.

2888
01:43:39,72 --> 01:43:42,02
Rosetta 2 runs existing Mac apps,

2889
01:43:39,72 --> 01:43:42,02
Rosetta 2 runs existing Mac apps,

2890
01:43:42,48 --> 01:43:45,05
our Virtualization technology
makes it easier than ever

2891
01:43:45,12 --> 01:43:47,69
to bring other environments,
like Linux, to the Mac,

2892
01:43:47,76 --> 01:43:53,60
and Mac users can, for the first time,
run iOS and iPadOS apps directly,

2893
01:43:47,76 --> 01:43:53,60
and Mac users can, for the first time,
run iOS and iPadOS apps directly,

2894
01:43:53,66 --> 01:43:57,07
tapping into
the world's most vital app ecosystem.

2895
01:43:53,66 --> 01:43:57,07
tapping into
the world's most vital app ecosystem.

2896
01:43:57,13 --> 01:44:01,30
Now, we know our Mac developers will be
eager to get started on this new platform.

2897
01:43:57,13 --> 01:44:01,30
Now, we know our Mac developers will be
eager to get started on this new platform.

2898
01:44:02,00 --> 01:44:05,97
So to get them going right away,
we're launching a Quick Start Program.

2899
01:44:06,51 --> 01:44:07,98
The focus of the Quick Start Program

2900
01:44:08,04 --> 01:44:10,61
is to enable developers
to make their apps Universal

2901
01:44:10,68 --> 01:44:13,55
and take advantage
of all the capabilities of Apple Silicon.

This program also includes
new Developer Transition Kit hardware

2909
01:44:29,53 --> 01:44:33,17
so developers can get going
even before we ship production systems.
