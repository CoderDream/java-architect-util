‎为了采取行动而释放的能量 ‎便会留在体内
then the energy to do something stays in your body,

110

115
00:06:12,24 --> 00:06:16,83
‎是我们现在没办法做到的事情
connected to others is something that we just really don't have right now.

‎经常会失眠 夜间焦虑 无法入睡
A lot of insomnia, a lot of anxiety at night, difficulty sleeping.

‎凌晨两点 我还是睡不着
2:00 a.m., and I can't sleep.

122
00:06:36,22 --> 00:06:38,10
‎当我们焦虑的时候 常常难以入睡
[Levitin] It's often hard to sleep when we're stressed

123
00:06:38,18 --> 00:06:40,81
‎因为我们血管里还流淌着肾上腺素
because we've got adrenaline coursing through our veins

124
00:06:40,90 --> 00:06:42,56
‎它会让我们保持清醒
which serves to keep us awake.

125
00:06:43,02 --> 00:06:47,82
‎还可能因为我们在左思右想 ‎大脑不愿意休眠
It also can be because we're ruminating.

132
00:06:45,69 --> 00:06:47,82
Our brains won't turn off.

126
00:06:47,90 --> 00:06:49,65
‎我没办法进行艺术创作
I can't really think about being creative

127
00:06:49,74 --> 00:06:53,62
‎因为我会担心自己付不起账单
when I have to worry about how I'm gonna eventually have to pay some my bills,

128
00:06:53,70 --> 00:06:57,79
‎疫情什么时候结束 或者我的健康 ‎和被传染的可能性
or when this stuff is gonna end, or my health and potentially catching it.

129
00:06:58,20 --> 00:07:00,92
‎焦虑的大脑只关心一件事
[narrator] A stressed brain has one priority:

130
00:07:01,21 --> 00:07:03,79
‎让你准备战斗或者逃跑
getting you ready to fight or flee.

131
00:07:03,88 --> 00:07:07,26
‎所以应对的第一步 ‎就是说服你的大脑你很安全
So coping begins with convincing your brain that you're safe,

132
00:07:07,34 --> 00:07:09,92
‎而最简单的方法就是
and the easiest way to do that is by...

133
00:07:10,72 --> 00:07:14,55
‎（呼吸）
[deep inhale]

141
00:07:12,59 --> 00:07:13,89
[exhale]

134
00:07:14,64 --> 00:07:18,35
‎通常是由你的大脑来决定是否安全
[narrator] Usually it's your brain that decides when it's safe to relax.

135
00:07:18,43 --> 00:07:20,06
‎但当你深呼吸的时候
But when you breathe deeply,

136
00:07:20,48 --> 00:07:23,48
‎安全的信息会被传送回去
the message of safety gets passed back up the line,

137
00:07:23,56 --> 00:07:26,69
‎你的副交感神经系统会更活跃
and your parasympathetic nerves become more active.

138
00:07:27,28 --> 00:07:28,57
‎这就像是一个作弊码
It's like a cheat code, forcing your system back into balance.

140
00:07:32,24 --> 00:07:36,12
‎这其实可以通过 ‎我们心跳的间隔来测量
We can actually measure this, too, through the gaps in our heartbeats.

141
00:07:37,62 --> 00:07:40,37
‎当你平静的时候 间隔会更大
When you're calm, the gaps are more varied

142
00:07:40,46 --> 00:07:43,92
‎因为你的油门和刹车在相互博弈
because of that push and pull between your gas pedal and your brakes.

143
00:07:44,25 --> 00:07:48,67
‎你的心率变异性会更高 也就是HRV

168
00:09:08,13 --> 00:09:11,42
‎我一天看一次且只看一次新闻
I check the news once a day and once a day only, and that's because

169
00:09:11,50 --> 00:09:15,42
‎这是因为我知道 ‎那天看的其他任何东西

185
00:09:55,51 --> 00:09:59,14
‎然而问题在于 麻木不等于不存在

186
00:09:59,22 --> 00:10:02,81
‎麻木是因为情绪太多无法承受

192
00:10:21,57 --> 00:10:24,95
‎我们可能会下意识地憎恨不确定性
