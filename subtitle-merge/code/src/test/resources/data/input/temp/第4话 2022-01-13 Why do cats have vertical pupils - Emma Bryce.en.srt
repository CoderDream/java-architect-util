1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,050
Peering into the eyes 
of different animals,

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,380
you’ll see some extraordinarily
shaped pupils.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,760
But why?

4
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:17,050
It turns out that pupil shape 
is a powerful indicator

5
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:20,140
of what role an animal plays 
in its ecosystem.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:23,640
Pupils mark the hollow opening
in the iris,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,150
the eye’s band of pigmented muscle.

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,610
They’re the portholes through which
light enters the eye,

9
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:33,610
where it then strikes the retina 
and activates light-sensitive cells,

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,280
setting the process of vision in motion.

11
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,870
Pupils are black because most of the
light that enters them is absorbed.

12
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,580
Their size changes in response
to brightness,

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,170
as well as certain drugs 
and emotional and mental states—

14
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:51,130
but their basic form varies greatly
among species.

15
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:56,800
House cats, for one, are twilight hunters 
with vertically elongated pupils.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,520
In the dark, these structures
expand dramatically,

17
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,390
taking in the available light.

18
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,560
When it’s bright, they shrink into slits.

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:12,860
In fact, cat pupils are so flexible that
their maximum area is 135 times greater

20
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,440
than their minimum area—

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,160
whereas our pupils only shrink
and expand 15-fold.

22
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,330
And because of how the slit pupil 
takes in light,

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,500
it creates sharp, vertical contours.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:28,330
When the cat’s brain processes 
the visuals from each eye,

25
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,880
the small but sharp differences 
between them

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,260
help the cat judge 
the precise distance of its target.

27
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,800
In fact, many other ambush hunters also
have vertically elongated pupils—

28
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,600
but mainly those whose eyes are
located closer to the ground.

29
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,600
This may be because these pupils are
especially useful in perceiving objects

30
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,320
at the relative short distances
these animals tend to hunt.

31
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:57,910
The world looks very different from behind
the horizontally elongated pupils

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,700
of many grazing and browsing animals, 
like goats.

33
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,580
These pupils, situated 
on either side of the head,

34
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:12,210
let horizontal bands of light in that
give the goat a near-360-degree view

35
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,720
and provide it with sharp,
horizontal images.

36
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,010
This helps goats detect any
disruption to the horizon—

37
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:24,810
alerting them to potential predators— 
while still enabling them to see ahead

38
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,520
and detect obstacles 
as they make their escape.

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,480
In fact, goats always keep their pupils
aligned with the horizon,

40
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,490
rotating their eyeballs in their sockets
as they move their heads up and down.

41
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,240
Meanwhile, nocturnal geckos have pupils
that shrink into slits

42
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,450
studded with pinholes 
in higher light conditions.

43
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:49,920
Each pinhole projects a separate, sharp
image onto the geckos retina.

44
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,790
Scientists think that comparing 
these different inputs

45
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:56,800
might help the gecko judge distance
without having to move.

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,800
And while they might have fooled you,

47
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,470
mantises and other insects and crustaceans
have “pseudopupils.”

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,810
These aren’t optical structures;

49
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:09,770
they’re optical illusions 
experienced by the observer.

50
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:15,320
Mantises have compound eyes composed
of thousands of light-sensing units.

51
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,740
When some are aimed at you,
they appear black

52
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,070
because they’re absorbing most wavelengths
of incoming light—

53
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:24,530
but there’s no actual opening.

54
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,040
So, why do we have round pupils?

55
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:33,630
Elongated pupils help sharpen certain
dimensions of an animal's vision.

56
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,920
But scientists think that, for animals
like us with circular pupils,

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
this is a lower priority.

58
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:44,090
Instead of seeing some elements 
of a scene in extreme focus,

59
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:47,140
we see a larger picture 
in relative detail,

60
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:50,270
which enables more general skills 
of observation.

61
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,230
This may be especially helpful
for foragers looking for food,

62
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:57,190
hunters eyeballing and chasing
their prey,

63
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:00,900
and social animals recognizing 
other faces.

64
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:04,160
As we peer at different pupils, 
patterns emerge.

65
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,700
And yet there are exceptions.

66
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:12,120
For example, Pallas’s cats and mongooses
are both small ambush predators,

67
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,960
but the Pallas’s cat has round pupils
and mongooses have goat-like pupils.

68
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:21,300
And we’ve only explored
a few pupil shapes.

69
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,760
Other animals have crescent-
or heart-shaped pupils.

70
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,140
And the cuttlefish has perhaps
some of the most bizarre:

71
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,440
their pupils are circular in the dark,
but W-shaped in the light.

72
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,110
So, what’s going on here?

73
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,610
Well, wouldn’t we all like to know?
