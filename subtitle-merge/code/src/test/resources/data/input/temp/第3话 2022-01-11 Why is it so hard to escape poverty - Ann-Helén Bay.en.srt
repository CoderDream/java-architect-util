1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,420
Imagine that you’ve been unemployed
and seeking work for months.

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,430
Government benefit programs have helped
you cover rent, utilities, and food,

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:17,220
but you're barely getting by.

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,270
Finally, you hear back 
about a job application.

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,810
You receive your first paycheck in months,
and things seem to be turning around.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,020
But there’s a catch.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,440
Your new job pays just enough to 
disqualify you from the benefit programs,

8
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,740
and not enough
to cover the same costs.

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,910
To make things worse, you have
to pay for transportation to work,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,030
and childcare while you’re at the office.

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,500
Somehow, you have less money now
than when you were unemployed.

12
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:45,290
Economists call this demoralizing
situation the welfare trap—

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:48,500
one of the many different poverty traps
affecting millions of people

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,590
around the world.

15
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,920
Poverty traps are economic 
and environmental circumstances

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,590
that reinforce themselves, 
perpetuating poverty for generations.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:00,260
Some poverty traps are tied 
to an individual’s circumstances,

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,140
like a lack of access to healthy food 
or education.

19
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,390
Others can affect entire nations,

20
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:08,360
such as cycles of corrupt government
or climate change.

21
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,480
But the cruel irony of welfare traps
in particular

22
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,200
is that they stem from the very policies
designed to battle poverty.

23
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,700
Most societies throughout history employed
some strategies

24
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,240
to help people in poverty 
meet basic needs.

25
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:25,040
Before the 20th century, 
religious groups and private charities

26
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:26,710
often led such initiatives.

27
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,420
Today, these are called welfare programs,

28
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,500
and they usually take the form 
of government-provided subsidies

29
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:35,920
for housing, food, energy, and healthcare.

30
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,890
Typically, these programs
are means-tested,

31
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,140
meaning that only people who fall 
below a certain income level

32
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,810
are eligible for benefits.

33
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,890
This policy is designed to ensure aid 
goes to those who need it most.

34
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,690
But it also means people lose access
as soon as they earn more

35
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:53,320
than the qualification threshold,

36
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:57,160
regardless of whether or not they're
financially stable enough to stay there.

37
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,280
This vicious cycle is harmful to both
those in poverty and those outside of it.

38
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,580
Mainstream economic models assume people
are rational actors

39
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:08,000
who weigh the cost and benefits 
of their options

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,670
and choose the most advantageous 
path forward.

41
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,420
If those in poverty know they'll gain
no net benefit from working,

42
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,220
they're incentivized to remain
in government assistance.

43
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,930
Of course, people work for many reasons,

44
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,970
including societal norms
and personal values.

45
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:26,270
But income is a major incentive
to pursuing employment.

46
00:02:26,270 --> 00:02:30,020
And when less people take on new jobs,
the economy slows down,

47
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,480
keeping people in poverty

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,190
and potentially pushing people 
on the cusp of poverty over the edge.

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,320
Some have suggested this feedback loop
could be removed

50
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,280
by eliminating government assistance 
programs altogether.

51
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,330
But most agree the solution 
is neither realistic nor humane.

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,920
So how can we redesign benefits in a way
that doesn't penalize people for working?

53
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,750
Many countries have tried different
ways to circumvent this problem.

54
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,840
Some allow people to continue receiving
benefits for a given period

55
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,340
after finding a job,

56
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,140
while others phase out benefits
gradually as income increases.

57
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,680
These policies still remove some
financial incentive to work,

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:09,350
but the risk of a welfare trap is lower.

59
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:15,520
Other governments provide benefits like
education, childcare, or medical care

60
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,530
equally across all their citizens.

61
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,200
One proposed solution takes this idea
of universal benefits even further.

62
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,290
A universal basic income would provide 
a fixed benefit to all members of society,

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,790
regardless of wealth or employment status.

64
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:33,580
This is the only known policy that could
entirely remove welfare traps,

65
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:37,670
since any earned wages would supplement 
the benefit rather than replace it.

66
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:42,970
In fact, by creating a stable income floor
below which no one can fall,

67
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:47,180
basic income might prevent people from
falling into poverty in the first place.

68
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,270
Numerous economists and thinkers

69
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,520
have championed this idea 
since the 18th century.

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,650
But for now, universal basic income 
remains largely hypothetical.

71
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,570
Although it's been tried in some
places on a limited scale,

72
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:03,860
these local experiments don’t tell us
much about how the policy

73
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:07,240
would play out across an entire nation—
or a planet.

74
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,830
Whatever strategy governments pursue,

75
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,500
solving the welfare trap requires
respecting people’s agency and autonomy.

76
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:18,550
Only by empowering individuals 
to create long-term change

77
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,670
in their lives and communities

78
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:23,760
can we begin to break the cycle 
of poverty.
