1
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:10,880
Every morning, Helios harnessed
his winged horses,

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,850
unleashed his golden chariot, 
and set out across the sky.

3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:22,480
As the Sun God transformed the rosy dawn 
into the golden blooms of day,

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,560
he thought of those far below.

5
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:29,980
Years ago, he fell in love 
with a water nymph named Clymene.

6
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:35,110
Together, they had seven daughters
and one son named Phaethon.

7
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,910
But Helios had a wandering eye.

8
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,120
Clymene eventually left him, 
taking their children with her

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,870
and marrying King Merops of Ethiopia.

10
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:51,550
When Phaethon was little, Clymene told him
tales of his divine father.

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,010
As he grew into a young man,

12
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,850
he took a special pride in knowing
he was the Sun God’s child.

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:06,350
However, one day, Epaphus, Phaethon’s peer
who was himself the son of Zeus,

14
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,190
sought to temper Phaethon’s arrogance,

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,030
taunting that Helios wasn’t his father
after all.

16
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,580
With no absolute proof to the contrary,
the possibility bore into Phaethon’s mind.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,080
He feared that his mother had lied.

18
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:25,410
And who was he if not Helios’ son?

19
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,290
When Phaethon confronted Clymene,

20
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:32,000
she insisted that his father
was the powerful Sun God.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:35,420
Nevertheless, Phaethon was seized 
by doubt.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,430
So, Clymene sent him 
off to ask Helios directly.

23
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:45,890
Walking eastward, Phaethon entered 
the Sun God’s gleaming palace at last.

24
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,650
Once his eyes adjusted to the brightness,

25
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:53,280
he saw Helios’ radiant smile 
and open arms.

26
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,450
When Phaethon expressed his skepticism
that Helios was truly his father,

27
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:00,620
the Sun God only beamed.

28
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:06,000
To dispel all doubt, he would grant 
Phaethon anything he wanted.

29
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,960
Basking in Helios’ glow,

30
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:13,840
Phaethon felt there was but one way
to prove their connection to the world—

31
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,010
and himself.

32
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,840
He needed to drive
Helios’ chariot for a day.

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:21,640
The Sun God’s smile dimmed.

34
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,470
In his daily journey,

35
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:29,060
he steered his fire-breathing horses 
through space at top speeds.

36
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,940
The task required masterful control

37
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,990
to ensure that the chariot raced 
along its precise celestial trajectory,

38
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:41,660
with a thin margin separating stability
from catastrophe.

39
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,660
Even Zeus wasn’t confident
in driving his chariot.

40
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,620
Helios begged his son to reconsider,

41
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:53,920
but Phaethon was steadfast, 
so the god prepared him for the journey.

42
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:57,970
With a crack of the reins, he was off.

43
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:03,090
In flight, Phaethon’s 
mortal insecurities fell away.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,270
But soon, the reins slackened 
in his hands.

45
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,480
Unaccustomed to the feathery weight 
of a mortal,

46
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,810
the radiant horses climbed
higher and higher.

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,070
The chariot whirled past constellations,

48
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:23,740
narrowly missing the pincers of Scorpio
and the arrow of Sagittarius.

49
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:28,040
With the Sun so far away, 
the Earth darkened,

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,410
and the seas began to crackle and freeze.

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,210
Startled, Phaethon
sharply pulled the reins.

52
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:39,880
The horses lurched and the chariot plunged
towards the Earth's surface.

53
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:45,810
Lakes boiled and forests burned as 
Phaethon struggled to pull the chariot up,

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,350
leaving deserts in his wake.

55
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,940
Back on Mount Olympus, 
the Gods were panicking.

56
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,110
Zeus saw that Phaethon was destined for 
a crash that would set the Earth ablaze.

57
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,110
So, he hurled one of his mighty
thunderbolts at the boy.

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,820
The horses tore away,

59
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,960
leaving Phaethon suspended in the heavens 
for just one moment,

60
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,090
before he plummeted to the Earth, 
into the river Eridanus,

61
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,170
never to resurface.

62
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:23,220
Phaethon’s sisters gathered 
on the riverbank to weep,

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:29,810
gradually metamorphosing into poplar trees
that leaked precious amber into the water.

64
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:35,060
Zeus repaired the Earth
and created an everlasting memorial,

65
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:38,440
strewing Phaethon’s likeness in the stars.

66
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,400
Overcome by grief, Helios had
hidden himself from the sky.

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,870
But he soon returned, 
and every day from then on,

68
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,580
as he raced through the heavens,
he greeted his son.

69
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,040
The constellation,
known as “Auriga,” or “the charioteer,”

70
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,880
stands as a reminder of a lost young man,

71
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,220
and his bid to harness powers
far greater than himself.
