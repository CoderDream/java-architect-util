1
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,760
Odin, the king of Asgard, 
was plagued by nightmares.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,890
Three fearsome figures haunted his dreams:

3
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:23,020
a massive, writhing shadow;

4
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,610
a shambling, rotting corpse;

5
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:30,940
and worst of all, 
a monstrous beast with a deadly bite.

6
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:35,490
Night after night, the creatures
besieged the king.

7
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,580
And although their true forms
were unknown to him,

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,330
he could tell they were related 
to Asgard’s most persistent problem:

9
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,830
Loki.

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:48,960
Despite having settled down
with his wife and sons,

11
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,880
Loki had been sneaking off to visit 
the giantess Angrboda.

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:58,760
And when the king learned this affair
had produced three children,

13
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,390
he was filled with unease.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:04,640
Odin summoned Thor and Tyr, 
two of his bravest warriors,

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,650
to travel to Jotunheim to capture 
Loki’s secret children.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,150
Upon arriving at Angrboda’s home,

17
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,320
the pair were immediately accosted
by Loki's first child,

18
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,870
a serpent named J?rmungandr.

19
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,950
The God of Thunder dodged 
the snake’s venom

20
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:24,830
and swiftly bound him to a pine tree.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:31,170
The second child, Hel, appeared as 
a glowing young woman from the right

22
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:33,970
and a moldering corpse from the left.

23
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,390
Her flesh flaked onto the ground 
as she silently submitted to her captors.

24
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:43,390
Finally, the third child leapt at Tyr.

25
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,600
The small wolf was fierce but harmless.

26
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,820
Tyr playfully cuffed its claws 
and stowed the cub in his pocket.

27
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,240
Back in Asgard, the warriors
presented their prisoners

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,240
and fearful recognition
seized Odin's heart.

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:04,330
Though these three were meager reflections
of his dark dreams,

30
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,210
the king was determined to dispose 
of them before his visions came true.

31
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,630
First, he banished J?rmungandr 
to the sea at the edge of the world.

32
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,550
Then he sent Hel deep below the earth
to join her fellow corpses.

33
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,220
But the wolf, named Fenrir, 
presented a challenge.

34
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,690
He’d already grown strong
enough to threaten the gods,

35
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,480
so Odin took a more patient approach.

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,650
For months, he supervised the creature,
watching Fenrir grow

37
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,660
from a cub to a wolf to a beast 
who spoke with the voice of a God.

38
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:47,040
Tyr visited frequently and found Fenrir
to be strong and clever.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,540
But as their bond deepened,
Odin's fear only grew.

40
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,880
One day, Odin forged his heaviest chains

41
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:59,050
and hauled them to Fenrir 
with a challenge.

42
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,640
He would bind the wolf
to test his growing strength.

43
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,890
Fenrir eagerly accepted the challenge 
and splintered the metal like old wood.

44
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:14,440
Odin returned to the forge, crafting
shackles that no man could lift alone.

45
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,440
These sturdy chains gave Fenrir pause.

46
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:23,280
But with an encouraging wink from Tyr,
he accepted the challenge.

47
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:28,160
The beast strained for a moment 
and then shattered his restraints

48
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,290
into a thousand pieces.

49
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,920
Desperate, Odin sought help 
from the most skilled makers of all:

50
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,210
the Dwarves.

51
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,680
Rather than metal, they sought 
the rarest ingredients;

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,390
from feline footsteps and fish breath

53
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,060
to the sinews of mountains 
and mighty bears.

54
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:52,140
With these, the Dwarves crafted Gleipnir,

55
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:56,860
an unbreakable chain in the guise 
of fine thread.

56
00:03:57,190 --> 00:04:02,530
When Odin challenged Fenrir a third time, 
the wolf laughed.

57
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,870
But as he examined the thread 
more closely,

58
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,750
Fenrir sensed Odin’s trickery 
and began to feel some fear himself.

59
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,330
Fenrir struck a deal.

60
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,000
He would accept the challenge,

61
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,800
but only if a god kept their hand 
in his mouth throughout.

62
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:25,550
With a heavy heart, Tyr volunteered.

63
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:31,640
The gods bound the wolf and as he strained
Gleipnir only grew tighter.

64
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,560
Fenrir felt the agony of betrayal—

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,570
not only from Odin,
but from his reluctant friend.

66
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,650
With a howl of fury, 
he bit through Tyr’s wrist

67
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:47,070
and vowed to destroy Odin 
for tricking him.

68
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,120
Watching his nightmare come to life,

69
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,330
Odin thrust Tyr’s blade
between Fenrir jaws,

70
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:59,250
releasing a torrent of saliva 
that became a furious river.

71
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,340
While the beast was not dead, 
he was bound,

72
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:06,800
and Odin celebrated his victory over fate.

73
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:12,350
But in truth, his actions had
only sealed his doom.

74
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,270
Beneath the waves, 
J?rmungandr grew to encircle the world.

75
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,570
Hel rose to rule the dead
as queen of the Underworld.

76
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:30,830
And every day, Fenrir strained 
a little more against his chains,

77
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:36,290
inching ever closer to his bloody revenge.
