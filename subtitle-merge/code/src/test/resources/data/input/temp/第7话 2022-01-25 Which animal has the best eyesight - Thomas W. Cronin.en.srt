1
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,050
The animal kingdom boasts 
an incredible diversity of eyes.

2
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:15,510
Some rotate independently, while others
have squiggly-shaped pupils.

3
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,180
Some have protective lids,
others squirt blood.

4
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,600
But which creature has the best sight?

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,600
Which sees best in the darkness?

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,270
Which sees the most detail?

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,730
Which animal sees the most color?

8
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:31,320
And finally, 
which detects motion the fastest?

9
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:36,740
All eyes take in sensory stimuli
in the form of waves of light.

10
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:39,280
To convert these into everything we see,

11
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,830
eyes focus incoming light
onto photoreceptors.

12
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:46,460
These cells translate light 
into neural signals

13
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:49,380
and send them to the brain, 
where they’re finally processed.

14
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,380
The eyes that see best in darkness
are those that capture

15
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,880
as much available light as possible.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,760
Colossal squids have 
soccer-ball-sized eyes—

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,270
the largest known in existence.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,810
These may help them spot 
the faint glow of sperm whales

19
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,440
as they disturb light-producing organisms.

20
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:14,320
Some fish have eyes that are unique among
vertebrates because they use mirrors.

21
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:16,780
For the brownsnout spookfish,

22
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,830
each eye has an upward-facing lens 
and a downward-pointing mirror

23
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,210
composed of tiny crystal plates 
that efficiently gather light.

24
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,500
They can see up and down simultaneously,

25
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:33,710
and may perceive distinct shapes, 
even in the ocean’s depths.

26
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,090
Back on solid ground, 
arctic reindeer have adaptations

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,560
to deal with months of darkness.

28
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,940
The backs of reindeer eyes change color,
from gold in summer to blue in winter.

29
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,610
Their blue-backed eyes are about 
1,000 times more sensitive to light.

30
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:56,990
This may allow reindeer to recognize
important things in the snow

31
00:01:56,990 --> 00:01:58,990
like urine and lichen.

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:04,950
When it comes to the sharpest vision,
birds of prey soar above the competition.

33
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:10,670
To capture the most detail, an animal must
have lots of photoreceptors in its eye,

34
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:14,250
as well as increased 
visual processing power.

35
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:17,630
Raptors have an especially deep fovea—

36
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,350
a depression in the back of their eye
that fits more photoreceptors.

37
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:28,390
So, Peregrine falcons have vision that’s
more than twice as sharp as a human’s.

38
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,820
They’re able to zero in on a rabbit 
from more than three kilometers away.

39
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:37,780
When crowning the creature 
with the best color vision,

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,700
the picture gets complicated.

41
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:44,330
Different photoreceptors are sensitive
to specific waves of light,

42
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,290
meaning the colors we see 
are largely determined

43
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:49,790
by what kinds of photoreceptors we have.

44
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:54,960
Presumably, the more types of color 
photoreceptors an animal has,

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,710
the better its color vision.

46
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,970
Dogs have just two types.

47
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,510
Humans have three.

48
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:05,260
And we are far outdone
by some birds, fishes, and insects.

49
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,600
Bluebottle butterflies have at least
15 types of photoreceptors.

50
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,690
Seven of them are attuned 
to distinct blues and greens,

51
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:19,780
which researchers think might help them
track each other during high-speed chases.

52
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,530
Mantis shrimp have a whopping
16 kinds of photoreceptors,

53
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:28,870
with five reserved just for the 
ultraviolet, or UV, spectrum,

54
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,580
which humans can’t see.

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,540
But experiments suggest 
that the mantis shrimp’s ability

56
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,670
to discriminate between colors 
is more limited than you might expect.

57
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,840
Exactly how they use their complex eyes
is a mystery.

58
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:47,310
Meanwhile, with just four kinds
of color photoreceptors,

59
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:52,350
goldfish actually excel at discerning
subtle differences in shades.

60
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,440
Finally, insects have mastered the ability
to see the world... on the fly.

61
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,200
The fastest motion vision 
requires photoreceptors

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:04,870
that quickly sense changes in light,

63
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,410
and a brain that rapidly
processes the information.

64
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:13,500
A movie shot at 24 frames per second
gives us the perception

65
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,170
of near seamless motion.

66
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,050
But insects would see a slideshow.

67
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:23,220
Fly photoreceptors register changes 
10 times faster than we do,

68
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,800
making them especially hard to catch.

69
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,970
These animals have some 
of the best vision we know of,

70
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:32,270
but there's no winner across the board.

71
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,150
Each category has different top contenders
because vision requires tradeoffs.

72
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,190
So, some eyes are highly specialized,

73
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,820
while others, like ours, 
perform decently in many categories.

74
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,750
From eyes the size of soccer balls 
to those that see in UV—

75
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,500
the ways of looking at the world 
are as varied as the life forms in it.
