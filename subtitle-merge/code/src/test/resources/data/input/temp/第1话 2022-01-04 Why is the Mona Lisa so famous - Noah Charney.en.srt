1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,920
As dawn broke over Paris 
on August 21st, 1911,

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,850
Vincenzo Peruggia hoisted a painting 
off the wall

3
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:19,270
and slipped down the back stairs 
of the Louvre.

4
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:23,190
He was close to freedom, 
the exit just before him

5
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,690
when he encountered a two-pronged problem:

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,730
the door was locked 
and footsteps were approaching.

7
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:33,860
Tucked under Peruggia’s arm was
Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa.”

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,490
It's arguably the world's most
famous painting today.

9
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:39,910
But how did it achieve its status?

10
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:44,250
Leonardo is thought to have started 
the portrait in 1503

11
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,090
at the request of a Florentine businessman

12
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:51,050
who wanted a portrait of his wife, 
Lisa Gherardini.

13
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:55,380
Leonardo continued working 
on the painting for more than 10 years,

14
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,890
but it was unfinished by the time he died.

15
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:04,100
Over his lifetime, Leonardo conducted
groundbreaking studies on human optics,

16
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,730
which led him to pioneer
certain artistic techniques.

17
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:10,570
Some can be seen in the “Mona Lisa.”

18
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:17,240
Using “atmospheric perspective,” he made 
images at greater distances hazier,

19
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,450
producing the illusion of profound depth.

20
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:25,370
And with “sfumato,” he created subtle 
gradations between colors

21
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,580
that softened the edges of the forms 
he depicted.

22
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:31,000
All of this is striking,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,760
but is it enough to make the “Mona Lisa”
the world’s most famous painting?

24
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,890
Many scholars consider it an outstanding
Renaissance portrait—

25
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,600
but one among plenty.

26
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,430
And history is full of great paintings.

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,020
Indeed, the “Mona Lisa’s” 
rise to worldwide fame

28
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:51,770
depended largely on factors 
beyond the canvas.

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,070
King Fran?ois the First of France 
purchased the painting

30
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,530
and began displaying it 
after Leonardo’s death.

31
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:04,200
Then, in 1550, 
Italian scholar Giorgio Vasari

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,880
published a popular biography 
of Italian Renaissance artists,

33
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,540
Leonardo included.

34
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,840
The book was translated and
distributed widely,

35
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,260
and it contained a gushing description
of the “Mona Lisa”

36
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,970
as a hypnotic imitation of life.

37
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,350
Over the years, the “Mona Lisa” became
one of the most enviable pieces

38
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,060
in the French Royal Collection.

39
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:30,520
It hung in Napoleon’s bedroom 
and eventually went on public display

40
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,110
in the Louvre Museum.

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,490
There, visitors flocked
to see the once-private treasures

42
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,450
of the deposed aristocracy.

43
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:44,910
During the 1800s, a series of European 
scholars further hyped the “Mona Lisa” up,

44
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,660
fixating to a conspicuous degree
on the subject's allure.

45
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,880
In 1854, Alfred Dumesnil said that
Mona Lisa’s smile imparted

46
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:58,090
a “treacherous attraction.”

47
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,840
A year later, Théophile Gautier wrote 
of her “mocking lips”

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,100
and “gaze promising unknown pleasures.”

49
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,810
And in 1869, Walter Pater
described Mona Lisa

50
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:14,440
as the embodiment of timeless
feminine beauty.

51
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,740
By the 20th century, 
the portrait was an iconic piece

52
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,070
in one of the world’s most famous museums.

53
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:24,240
But the “Mona Lisa” wasn’t yet 
a household name.

54
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,330
It was Peruggia’s 1911 heist that helped
it skyrocket to unprecedented fame.

55
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:34,710
Having been contracted to make protective
cases for the Louvre,

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,920
it wasn’t totally inconceivable for 
Peruggia to be locked inside the museum.

57
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:44,760
And, lucky for him, when a workman 
encountered him in the stairwell,

58
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,390
he simply helped Peruggia open the door
and let him walk out into the morning.

59
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:53,900
The theft made international headlines.

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,820
People gathered to see the blank space
where the “Mona Lisa” once hung.

61
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,610
The police interviewed Peruggia because
he had worked at the Louvre,

62
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,660
but they never considered him a suspect.

63
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:08,700
Meanwhile, they interrogated Pablo Picasso
because of his connection

64
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,120
to a previous Louvre theft,
but eventually let him go.

65
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,380
For two years, Peruggia kept the painting
in a false-bottom suitcase,

66
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:20,050
then smuggled the “Mona Lisa” to Italy

67
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:23,380
and arranged to sell it 
to a Florentine art dealer.

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:29,100
Peruggia saw himself as an Italian patriot
returning an old master’s work.

69
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,890
But instead of being celebrated as such,
he was immediately arrested.

70
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:38,520
With the mystery solved, the “Mona Lisa” 
went back on display to large crowds,

71
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,490
and newspapers took the story 
for a victory lap.

72
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:46,410
In the following decades, conceptual
artist Marcel Duchamp mocked it;

73
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:50,700
Nazi art thieves pursued it;
Nat King Cole sang about it;

74
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,620
and museumgoers wielding stones, paint, 
acid, and teacups attacked it.

75
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,130
More than 500 years after its creation—
eyebrows and eyelashes long since faded—

76
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,220
the “Mona Lisa” is protected 
by a bulletproof, earthquake-safe case.

77
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:12,810
Now, it stands perhaps less as an
exemplary Renaissance portrait

78
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:17,520
and more as a testament to how 
we create and maintain celebrity.
