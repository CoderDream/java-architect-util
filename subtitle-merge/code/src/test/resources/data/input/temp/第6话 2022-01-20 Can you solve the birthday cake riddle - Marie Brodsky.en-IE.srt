Your friend’s birthday is tomorrow,
and he’s turning...

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,090
well... the _____ 
is that you’ve forgotten.

3
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,430
He’s older than 1, but beyond that,
he looks timeless.

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:18,310
You’d believe it if he was 2 or 200.

5
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,680
The birthday boy is a giant,

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,810
and you're afraid that if your
forgetfulness becomes known,

7
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:25,520
you'll become part of the feast.

8
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,650
The baker has meticulously prepared
a small mountain _____ of a cake,

9
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,030
and your job is to sculpt the giant’s age
as the chocolate centerpiece.

10
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,660
You would love to just count
the candles on the cake,

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,160
but you're much too small
to see the top of it.

12
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:43,660
Then you remember: the baker made
an interior tunnel

13
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:46,120
to ________ the candles from below.

14
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,210
While the _____ is asleep, 
you can _____ in,

15
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:52,090
count the candles and ______ undetected.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,390
As night sets, you pull on a full bodysuit
and brace yourself for vanilla cream.

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:01,850
Anywhere in the tunnel, you can see 
whether the candle above you is lit,

18
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,270
and can ______ it on or off.

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,520
Some are _________ on, and others off,
in no ___________ pattern.

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:13,990
The tunnel is a single loop, and in the 
dark you can’t tell its shape or size.

21
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,990
You aren’t carrying anything with you,
and any marks you make will disappear.

22
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,450
You need a strategy.

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,120
How can you count the candles?

24
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,870
Pause here to ______ it out for yourself.
Answer in 3

25
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:28,170
Answer in 2

26
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,040
Answer in 1

27
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,880
There are a few ways 
to _____ this problem.

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,010
Let's start with the most straightforward.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:38,300
There’s _______ one way to mark
a ________ in the tunnel:

30
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,010
the state of the candle.

31
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,930
You can mark the first candle you reach 
by lighting it or keeping it on.

32
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,770
If you walk forward, you’ll eventually
find another lit candle—

33
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,560
either a new one or you’re starting one.

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,530
The question is: how could you know which?

35
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:57,610
Here’s one approach: turn it off 
and backtrack to the start

36
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:01,780
by passing the same number of candles 
you passed on the way there.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,750
If the starting candle is now off,

38
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,040
you’ve completed the loop
and know the giant’s age!

39
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:12,840
Otherwise, depart again, 
continuing until the next lit candle,

40
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,630
testing if it’s your starting one 
and so on.

41
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,880
This will work... eventually.

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,510
But if the _____ isn’t young,
and many candles are on,

43
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,140
you might have a ________ to run
between now and sunrise.

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,810
And you __________ don’t want to be 
in the cake when he starts _______ in.

45
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,440
So let’s look for a more 
efficient solution.

46
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,990
How about testing a ______ of hypotheses
about the giant's age?

47
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:40,240
Suppose you guess he’s turning 10.

48
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,490
You could light the starting candle, 
walk forward 10,

49
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:47,540
switch or leave the ___________ 
candle off, and return.

50
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,670
If the starting candle’s still on,
10 isn’t the answer.

51
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,760
If it’s off, 10 could be right, 
but you may have made ________ loops—

52
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,260
so 10′s _______ 5 and 2
are also possibilities.

53
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,140
Then you would have passed
a repeating pattern—

54
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,020
but that could have just been
the starting arrangement.

55
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,270
So what if you changed the candles
on the way?

56
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:14,310
If you turned them all on while walking 
from candle 1 to 11,

57
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:16,940
switch that off, then turn back,

58
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,910
the first unlit candle you find 
would tell you the _____ candle count.

59
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,780
And if you don't hit any
extinguished candles,

60
00:03:24,950 --> 00:03:28,000
you'll know that the total
must be higher than 10.

61
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,750
You could then pick a larger guess
and try again.

62
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,750
To be systematic, you could increase 
your guess

63
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,670
by the same number each time, say 4.

64
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,510
If there were 99 candles,

65
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:46,310
this method would take 24 roundtrips 
and _______ visiting nearly 2,700 candles.

66
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,600
But you don’t have to increase
your guess linearly.

67
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,060
For instance, you could double it, 
from 10 to 20 to 40,

68
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:59,610
and discover the true number 
on your 5th trip after around 560 candles.

69
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:03,200
Doubling allows you to reach
high numbers quickly,

70
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,780
while starting with small _________ 
in ____ there are only a few candles.

71
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,500
After _________ a _______ trek,

72
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,710
you’re pleased to discover 
the _____ is only turning 12.

73
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,920
You hurry to change into slightly
more _____________ clothing;

74
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:23,970
chisel up some ________ chocolate numbers;
and at the party, make your own wish:

75
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:27,350
that you’re not downwind when your friend 
blows out his candles.
