As the sun sets on a plantation
in Jamaica,

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,050
children _____ to Mr. Kwaku for a story.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,800
They all know he’s full of _____ 
from Ghana, the land of their ancestors.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:20,680
But what they don’t know, Kwaku winks,

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,140
is how their ancestors got those stories
in the first place.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,820
Long ago, all stories ________ to Nyame,
the all-seeing Sky God.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,200
People on Earth were _____ 
and knew nothing about their history.

8
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,740
But one ________ decided
enough was enough.

9
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,330
Anansi, the tricky, shapeshifting spider,

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,950
resolved to bring the stories
down to Earth.

11
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:44,500
He ____ a web that _________ 
into the clouds

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,340
and climbed up to ________ the Sky God.

13
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:51,550
Crouching at Nyame’s feet,
Anansi _______ at the top of his lungs

14
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:54,420
that he had come to take _________ 
of the world’s stories.

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,140
Looking down from his golden stool,

16
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,810
Nyame hooted with ________ 
at the spider’s absurd request.

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,060
Nyame told Anansi that he could have
all the stories he wished—

18
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,810
but only if he could complete
an __________ task.

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,740
If Anansi brought him 
Osebo the Leopard, Onini the Python,

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,530
Mmoboro the Hornet, 
and Mmoatia the Forest Spirit,

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,450
then he could take the stories.

22
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,370
Anansi ______ accepted.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,620
Nyame didn’t see him grinning 
as he scuttled away.

24
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,000
Back on Earth, Anansi _______ 
his magic bag and set to work.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,590
Anansi found Onini the Python
bathing in the sun.

26
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,340
Anansi scoffed that Onini 
couldn’t be the longest animal,

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,760
saying he looked no longer 
than a _____ of bamboo cane.

28
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,770
Enraged, Onini _________ himself across
the bamboo to _____ his lengthiness.

29
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,520
Anansi quickly _____ him tight-tight 
to each end and placed him in his bag.

30
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:55,780
Next, Anansi ___ a _____ pit 
in the middle of the path

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:59,950
Osebo the Leopard usually prowled,
and covered it with banana leaves.

32
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:02,910
Sure enough, ______ Osebo soon fell in.

33
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:08,170
Anansi scolded Osebo for his carelessness,
but offered to ______ him.

34
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:12,960
As he helped Osebo out of the pit,
Anansi swiftly jabbed him with his knife.

35
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,750
Osebo fell back to the ground

36
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:18,300
where Anansi wound him up
tight-tight in ______ thread.

37
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:22,720
Then, Anansi heard Mmoboro 
and his hornets buzzing.

38
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,510
He __________ __________ them.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,480
This would be tricky— their ______ 
could make someone swell up and die—

40
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,100
but Anansi knew they hated rain.

41
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:34,280
He filled his mouth with water 
and ____ it at the swarm.

42
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,650
As they panicked, Anansi _____ the hornets
to _______ in his gourd,

43
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,700
where they found themselves trapped.

44
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,160
Anansi had one more task:
to _______ Mmoatia

45
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,620
the elusive and mischievous Forest Spirit.

46
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:52,540
She usually hid herself deep in the woods,
but Anansi knew she was lonely.

47
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,590
So, he made a little doll covered in sap
and left it in her path.

48
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,800
When she came upon it, 
Mmoatia spoke to the doll

49
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,550
but became enraged when it didn’t answer.

50
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:05,310
She hit the disrespectful doll

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,060
and her small fists _____ 
to its ______ surface.

52
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,480
Anansi _______ Mmoatia up tight-tight 
and _______ her into his bag

53
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,610
along with the other creatures.

54
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:18,940
Triumphantly, he climbed his web
back into the clouds.

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,740
When the Sky God saw that Anansi 
had completed the __________ task,

56
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,030
he was amazed.

57
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:27,200
Nyame told Anansi 
that he had ______ the world’s stories.

58
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,620
Dancing for joy, Anansi ________ them up,
stuffed the stories into his bag,

59
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,540
and descended to Earth.

60
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:38,420
There, he _________ the stories 
throughout the world for people to share.

61
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:41,430
And they did, Kwaku tells the children.

62
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,600
Generations have continued
telling and reimagining Anansi’s stories

63
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,720
even after being stolen from Africa
and enslaved.

64
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:54,150
Anansi may be small, but “cunning’s
better than strong,” Kwaku says,

65
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,690
and tells the children to take Anansi’s 
stories with them wherever they go.

66
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:02,990
Looking at his audience, Kwaku knows
that Anansi will persist

67
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:07,620
as a ______ of _______________ 
and __________ in the face of oppression,

68
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,960
and a testament to the ________ power
of storytelling.
