00:00:07,04 --> 00:00:09,05
[siren wailing] 

2
00:00:13,72 --> 00:00:16,51
[birds chirping]

3
00:00:17,76 --> 00:00:19,72
[narrator] Before closing their borders...

4
00:00:20,85 --> 00:00:22,89
and locking down their citizens...

5
00:00:24,60 --> 00:00:28,73
many world leaders downplayed
the new virus that was sweeping the globe.

6
00:00:29,07 --> 00:00:31,65
[in Italian] The situation
is absolutely under control.

7
00:00:31,74 --> 00:00:37,03
[in Persian]
This is one of our enemies’ plots,

8
00:00:37,12 --> 00:00:39,16
dragging the country to a shutdown.

9
00:00:39,24 --> 00:00:42,29
[in English] We should be going about
our business as usual.

10
00:00:42,79 --> 00:00:46,33
[in Portuguese] A lot of that is fantasy
when it comes to the coronavirus.

11
00:00:46,42 --> 00:00:48,29
[in English] Nobody knew
there'd be a pandemic

12
00:00:48,38 --> 00:00:49,96
or an epidemic of this proportion.

13
00:00:51,92 --> 00:00:54,34
[narrator] But many who work
in infectious disease

14
00:00:54,42 --> 00:00:56,72
knew a pandemic like this was coming.

15
00:00:57,55 --> 00:01:00,01
In fact, in the spring of 2019,

16
00:01:00,10 --> 00:01:02,68
months before the first case of COVID-19,

17
00:01:03,10 --> 00:01:05,52
we interviewed several of them
for this show.

18
00:01:05,85 --> 00:01:08,44
Well, if you think of anything
that could come along

19
00:01:08,52 --> 00:01:11,15
that would kill millions of people,

20
00:01:11,23 --> 00:01:13,90
the pandemic is our greatest risk.

21
00:01:14,99 --> 00:01:16,61
In terms of the death toll,

22
00:01:16,70 --> 00:01:21,99
a pandemic would rival
even the gigantic wars of the past.

23
00:01:22,62 --> 00:01:27,17
The economy will shut down,
the cost to humanity will be unbelievable,

24
00:01:27,25 --> 00:01:31,71
and no country will be immune
from the problem this will create.

25
00:01:32,34 --> 00:01:35,47
[Maryn McKenna] It really takes
an extraordinary act of political will

26
00:01:35,55 --> 00:01:40,14
to say, "Yes, right now,
things don't look that bad,

27
00:01:40,22 --> 00:01:42,64
but we're going to send funding
to public health anyway,

28
00:01:42,72 --> 00:01:45,56
because we know that someday
it will be bad."

29
00:01:46,06 --> 00:01:49,65
We estimate there are
around 1.5 million viruses in wildlife

30
00:01:49,73 --> 00:01:51,27
that we don't yet know about.

31
00:01:51,36 --> 00:01:54,94
Any one of those could be spilling over
into human population right now.

32
00:01:55,78 --> 00:01:58,66
[narrator] When a virus jumps
from an animal to a human,

33
00:01:58,74 --> 00:02:00,66
it's called a zoonotic virus,

34
00:02:01,32 --> 00:02:02,74
and for decades,

35
00:02:02,83 --> 00:02:07,04
these kinds of new viruses have been
causing more and more outbreaks.

36
00:02:07,54 --> 00:02:09,00
We know some pretty lethal ones,

37
00:02:09,08 --> 00:02:11,84
but we expect that there are others
out there that are more lethal,

38
00:02:11,92 --> 00:02:13,71
that are better at being transmitted,

39
00:02:13,80 --> 00:02:17,13
where we've got no drugs and no vaccines.
They're the big risk.

40
00:02:17,72 --> 00:02:20,30
[narrator] That's what happened with SARS
in 2002,

41
00:02:20,39 --> 00:02:25,01
which was a new coronavirus that spread
around the world, killing hundreds.

42
00:02:25,93 --> 00:02:28,69
And it happened again with MERS in 2012,

43
00:02:28,77 --> 00:02:32,44
which was also a new coronavirus
that killed hundreds.

44
00:02:33,27 --> 00:02:36,53
These outbreaks caused panic
around the world,

45
00:02:36,61 --> 00:02:37,78
for a brief moment.

46
00:02:38,11 --> 00:02:40,86
But experts, they stayed worried.

47
00:02:41,82 --> 00:02:45,37
There's a risk with something
like SARS or MERS,

48
00:02:45,45 --> 00:02:48,08
that it'll be something
we're not ready for.

49
00:02:48,16 --> 00:02:50,37
Could it be a coronavirus again?
Certainly.

50
00:02:50,46 --> 00:02:52,33
[narrator] And of course, it was.

51
00:02:53,50 --> 00:02:54,46
[indistinct talking]

52
00:02:54,54 --> 00:02:55,67
[patient coughing] 

53
00:02:56,00 --> 00:02:59,38
[narrator] So, of all the viruses
out there, why did this one

54
00:02:59,47 --> 00:03:03,68
end up becoming the kind of pandemic
we haven't seen in more than a century?

55
00:03:04,80 --> 00:03:07,72
And how does a pandemic like this end?

56
00:03:08,85 --> 00:03:11,60
[man] A virus can be just as destructive
as a bomb or a missile.

57
00:03:11,69 --> 00:03:12,52
[sneezes]

58
00:03:12,98 --> 00:03:14,98
[Tedros Ghebreyesus]
We're deeply concerned

59
00:03:15,06 --> 00:03:18,53
by the alarming levels
of spread and inaction.

60
00:03:19,03 --> 00:03:21,86
COVID-19 is a pandemic.

61
00:03:21,95 --> 00:03:25,20
[Anthony Fauci]
The cases continue to increase globally.

62
00:03:25,28 --> 00:03:27,49
What we need to do is flatten that down.

63
00:03:28,62 --> 00:03:31,16
[Daszak] We're going to have outbreaks
in developing countries

64
00:03:31,25 --> 00:03:33,08
that are just going to be raging.

65
00:03:34,13 --> 00:03:37,25
[man] The campaign against
infectious disease can succeed

66
00:03:37,34 --> 00:03:39,13
only if the public cooperates.

67
00:03:46,43 --> 00:03:49,68
[narrator] Viruses were one of the first
living things on Earth...

68
00:03:49,97 --> 00:03:52,39
but they're not alive like we are.

69
00:03:53,02 --> 00:03:56,15
They need to hijack other living cells
to reproduce,

70
00:03:56,23 --> 00:03:58,23
and that's their only goal,

71
00:03:58,32 --> 00:04:00,99
to survive and replicate themselves.

72
00:04:01,99 --> 00:04:06,07
The official name of this virus
is SARS-CoV-2.

73
00:04:07,20 --> 00:04:10,70
"COVID-19" is the name of the disease
it causes,

74
00:04:11,20 --> 00:04:14,87
which stands for
"Coronavirus disease 2019."

75
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:18,25
Corona, as in "crown."

76
00:04:18,34 --> 00:04:21,59
The virus is named
for its crown-like spikes.

77
00:04:22,72 --> 00:04:26,22
It spreads through droplets
when we sneeze, cough, or speak,

78
00:04:26,84 --> 00:04:30,52
and can enter us directly
through our eyes, nose, or mouth.

79
00:04:31,14 --> 00:04:34,73
The virus can also live
on a lot of surfaces for hours,

80
00:04:35,14 --> 00:04:37,31
so people can pick it up on their hands

81
00:04:37,40 --> 00:04:39,90
and infect themselves
if they touch their face,

82
00:04:40,73 --> 00:04:45,28
something the average person does
20 times an hour.

83
00:04:47,20 --> 00:04:50,45
Once inside the body,
those spikes act as a key,

84
00:04:50,54 --> 00:04:54,66
locking onto the proteins found
on the outside of many human cells.

85
00:04:55,54 --> 00:04:56,83
Once it's broken in,

86
00:04:56,92 --> 00:05:01,17
the virus gives the cell instructions
to produce more copies of itself,

87
00:05:01,25 --> 00:05:04,01
potentially invading more and more cells,

88
00:05:04,92 --> 00:05:08,47
which can lead to a fever, a cough,
and fatigue,

89
00:05:08,93 --> 00:05:10,26
but not always.

90
00:05:10,35 --> 00:05:13,77
And it potentially leads
to any of these symptoms, too.

91
00:05:14,06 --> 00:05:15,77
Research is ongoing.

92
00:05:16,94 --> 00:05:21,15
And you can be infected and spread it
without any symptoms,

93
00:05:21,23 --> 00:05:23,44
or they can be mistaken for the flu.

94
00:05:24,65 --> 00:05:27,82
That's what makes this coronavirus
so devious.

95
00:05:30,24 --> 00:05:34,00
So the most significant diseases
are often caused by viruses that

96
00:05:34,08 --> 00:05:37,25
are silent and slow, like HIV,

97
00:05:37,33 --> 00:05:41,67
or move very rapidly and cause symptoms
like coughing and fever

98
00:05:41,75 --> 00:05:44,21
that could be confused
with other diseases.

99
00:05:44,30 --> 00:05:47,51
[narrator] Going about their life,
a person with this coronavirus

100
00:05:47,59 --> 00:05:49,64
likely infects a couple other people,

101
00:05:49,93 --> 00:05:52,76
and each of those people
infects a couple more,

102
00:05:52,85 --> 00:05:54,85
and so on, and so on,

103
00:05:55,52 --> 00:05:59,52
which is why the number of cases
increases on an exponential curve,

104
00:05:59,90 --> 00:06:01,90
doubling every several days.

105
00:06:03,02 --> 00:06:06,36
Then some of those people will end up
with a severe lung infection,

106
00:06:06,90 --> 00:06:09,70
and certain groups are especially at risk.

107
00:06:11,20 --> 00:06:15,16
In one US sample, around three-quarters
of people who were hospitalized

108
00:06:15,24 --> 00:06:17,62
had at least one
underlying health condition,

109
00:06:18,12 --> 00:06:21,33
like lung disease, heart disease,
or diabetes.

110
00:06:22,34 --> 00:06:24,96
And while the exact numbers vary
by country,

111
00:06:25,38 --> 00:06:28,97
the risk of dying is clearly greater
the older you get,

112
00:06:29,05 --> 00:06:32,60
as you can see in this data
that Hubei, China reported

113
00:06:32,68 --> 00:06:34,76
two months after their outbreak began.

114
00:06:35,56 --> 00:06:38,64
And for reasons
scientists don't fully understand,

115
00:06:38,73 --> 00:06:41,23
the risk is also higher for men,

116
00:06:41,60 --> 00:06:44,44
possibly because of some
biological factors,

117
00:06:44,52 --> 00:06:46,65
or because they're more likely to smoke,

118
00:06:47,15 --> 00:06:50,15
or because men, according to some studies,

119
00:06:50,24 --> 00:06:52,87
aren't as good about washing their hands.

120
00:06:53,32 --> 00:06:54,33
On that note...

121
00:06:54,83 --> 00:06:57,29
Wash your hands as often as
you possibly can,

122
00:06:57,37 --> 00:07:01,08
and I know you're not always in a position
to be able to wash your hands,

123
00:07:01,46 --> 00:07:03,50
uh, but wash them as much as you can.

124
00:07:04,17 --> 00:07:05,42
[narrator] It's good advice.

125
00:07:05,88 --> 00:07:11,43
Now, this coronavirus is just the youngest
in a whole family of seven coronaviruses

126
00:07:11,51 --> 00:07:13,18
known to infect humans.

127
00:07:13,72 --> 00:07:16,93
It's now famous, as are SARS and MERS,

128
00:07:17,01 --> 00:07:19,06
because they've killed a lot of people.

129
00:07:19,14 --> 00:07:22,65
But these four are actually
more successful viruses.

130
00:07:23,02 --> 00:07:25,77
They cause up to a third of common colds.

131
00:07:26,23 --> 00:07:27,28
They're everywhere.

132
00:07:28,36 --> 00:07:31,24
Because viruses can actually
be better at spreading

133
00:07:31,32 --> 00:07:33,99
if they don't make their host that sick.

134
00:07:35,28 --> 00:07:36,45
Just look at bats.

135
00:07:36,53 --> 00:07:40,87
They're teeming with viruses
because viruses don't really bother them.

136
00:07:41,83 --> 00:07:42,83
But...

137
00:07:42,92 --> 00:07:46,71
They can transform into a new virus
once they get into the human population.

138
00:07:47,59 --> 00:07:51,05
[narrator] That's what scientists believe
happened with SARS in 2002.

139
00:07:51,59 --> 00:07:53,18
Just like this coronavirus,

140
00:07:53,26 --> 00:07:56,47
SARS emerged in a live animal market
in China.

141
00:07:57,14 --> 00:07:59,43
And since it was a new zoonotic virus,

142
00:07:59,52 --> 00:08:02,14
there were no treatments and no vaccine.

143
00:08:02,69 --> 00:08:06,40
But SARS was a lot less dangerous
than this coronavirus.

144
00:08:06,86 --> 00:08:09,40
People could only spread it
when they had symptoms,

145
00:08:09,48 --> 00:08:14,03
so it was easier to contain the virus
by just quarantining people who were sick.

146
00:08:15,36 --> 00:08:17,45
SARS was also a lot more deadly,

147
00:08:17,53 --> 00:08:20,08
which made it harder
for the virus to spread.

148
00:08:20,16 --> 00:08:23,79
[Daszak] A disease like SARS,
it kills 10% of people it infects,

149
00:08:23,87 --> 00:08:27,96
and then the survivors probably have
some immunity and can't be reinfected.

150
00:08:28,63 --> 00:08:31,63
And eventually, the only people
the virus can find

151
00:08:31,71 --> 00:08:33,59
are people who have immunity to it.

152
00:08:34,47 --> 00:08:37,51
[narrator] In the end, SARS infected
around 8,000 people

153
00:08:37,60 --> 00:08:39,47
in at least 29 countries.

154
00:08:39,72 --> 00:08:42,35
Seven hundred seventy-four of them died.

155
00:08:44,60 --> 00:08:47,06
Since then,
a group called EcoHealth Alliance

156
00:08:47,15 --> 00:08:49,57
has been coming to these caves
in southern China,

157
00:08:50,11 --> 00:08:51,19
catching bats,

158
00:08:51,28 --> 00:08:53,11
scanning them for viruses,

159
00:08:53,19 --> 00:08:56,95
and flagging the ones that could
most easily make the leap to us.

160
00:08:57,03 --> 00:08:59,70
[Daszak] And when we find them,
we raise the alert,

161
00:08:59,78 --> 00:09:01,66
and the government of China comes in

162
00:09:01,74 --> 00:09:05,46
and tries to reduce the exposure
of those populations to viruses.

163
00:09:06,12 --> 00:09:10,46
[narrator] They've found a lot so far,
including hundreds of coronaviruses.

164
00:09:11,42 --> 00:09:13,67
And they label them
as high risk or low risk,

165
00:09:13,76 --> 00:09:17,93
depending on how similar they are
to viruses that already infect humans.

166
00:09:18,59 --> 00:09:21,01
And a few years ago,
they discovered one that they called

167
00:09:21,10 --> 00:09:25,14
"bat coronavirus RaTG13,"

168
00:09:25,23 --> 00:09:27,73
which met the criteria for low-risk.

169
00:09:28,27 --> 00:09:33,07
When scientists sequenced the genome
of the virus behind COVID-19,

170
00:09:33,15 --> 00:09:38,49
they found that 96% of it
was identical to that bat virus.

171
00:09:39,45 --> 00:09:43,62
Scientists believe the bat virus
likely evolved into this new virus

172
00:09:43,70 --> 00:09:45,37
that could infect humans.

173
00:09:47,25 --> 00:09:49,79
So we had to go back to Dr. Daszak.

174
00:09:49,88 --> 00:09:54,05
At the time, our goal was
to find SARS-related viruses.

175
00:09:54,13 --> 00:09:55,46
This one looked too distant.

176
00:09:55,55 --> 00:09:57,80
We didn't think it would be able
to get into people.

177
00:09:57,88 --> 00:10:00,26
It didn't look like it was
a clear and present danger.

178
00:10:00,34 --> 00:10:01,26
Unfortunate.

179
00:10:02,51 --> 00:10:06,39
[narrator] It's impossible to predict
all the ways a virus might evolve.

180
00:10:07,14 --> 00:10:10,31
Scientists believe this one
may have mutated in another bat...

181
00:10:11,44 --> 00:10:15,03
or it may have jumped to another species
before jumping to us,

182
00:10:15,11 --> 00:10:17,49
like a pangolin or a snake...

183
00:10:18,53 --> 00:10:19,57
or a fish.

184
00:10:21,82 --> 00:10:26,66
That same kind of fluke happened
on a farm in Kansas over a century ago.

185
00:10:27,25 --> 00:10:28,71
Experts aren't certain,

186
00:10:28,79 --> 00:10:32,25
but they believe the 1918 flu pandemic
could have started

187
00:10:32,34 --> 00:10:36,84
when a bird with the flu and
a human with the flu met the same pig.

188
00:10:37,42 --> 00:10:39,76
The bird flu couldn't infect humans,

189
00:10:39,84 --> 00:10:42,43
and the human flu couldn't infect birds,

190
00:10:42,51 --> 00:10:46,22
but in one of the pig's cells,
those two viruses combined,

191
00:10:46,31 --> 00:10:48,60
creating a new zoonotic virus,

192
00:10:48,73 --> 00:10:50,56
H1N1,

193
00:10:50,65 --> 00:10:53,98
and that new virus
definitely could infect humans.

194
00:10:54,65 --> 00:10:57,36
It was unlike anything else in history.

195
00:10:59,78 --> 00:11:02,11
[narrator] For a disease
to become a pandemic,

196
00:11:02,20 --> 00:11:07,29
spreading around the world in months,
leading to potentially millions of deaths,

197
00:11:07,37 --> 00:11:10,37
it has to find an extraordinary balance...

198
00:11:11,21 --> 00:11:13,83
of contagiousness and deadliness.

199
00:11:14,25 --> 00:11:17,17
You can think of a disease
on those two scales.

200
00:11:17,84 --> 00:11:20,09
And these are
some of the infectious diseases

201
00:11:20,17 --> 00:11:22,39
that have been humanity's greatest foes.

202
00:11:23,22 --> 00:11:25,22
Here's the seasonal human flu,

203
00:11:25,85 --> 00:11:27,60
while this is the bird flu.

204
00:11:28,43 --> 00:11:32,77
And somewhere in this range
was the 1918 combination.

205
00:11:34,31 --> 00:11:35,56
It was airborne,

206
00:11:36,15 --> 00:11:40,07
meaning the virus could hang in the air,
infecting anyone who inhaled it.

207
00:11:41,53 --> 00:11:46,53
And it's estimated that it infected
one in every three people on Earth,

208
00:11:46,95 --> 00:11:51,96
and then it killed anywhere
from three to 20% of those infected.

209
00:11:52,37 --> 00:11:55,08
Medical record-keeping was not great
at that time.

210
00:11:56,04 --> 00:11:58,63
But that was nothing compared to smallpox,

211
00:11:59,05 --> 00:12:02,17
which killed 30% of the people who got it,

212
00:12:02,55 --> 00:12:04,47
and was also more contagious.

213
00:12:05,64 --> 00:12:09,18
That virus terrorized humanity
for thousands of years.

214
00:12:09,72 --> 00:12:11,31
In the 20th century alone,

215
00:12:11,39 --> 00:12:14,44
it killed hundreds of millions of people.

216
00:12:15,23 --> 00:12:17,90
And then there's Ebola,
which is even deadlier.

217
00:12:18,44 --> 00:12:20,74
But far fewer people have died from it,

218
00:12:20,82 --> 00:12:23,03
in part because it's so deadly,

219
00:12:23,11 --> 00:12:26,78
people who have it don't infect
too many others because they get so sick,

220
00:12:27,16 --> 00:12:28,16
they stay home,

221
00:12:28,62 --> 00:12:30,58
and then most don't survive.

222
00:12:31,41 --> 00:12:34,54
One of the unexpected things
about viruses is that sometimes,

223
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:39,09
a virus that has really obvious symptoms,
that kills people at a very high rate,

224
00:12:39,17 --> 00:12:41,92
doesn't become a pandemic.
It can't do that.

225
00:12:42,38 --> 00:12:46,30
[narrator] While a disease like measles,
which is far less deadly than Ebola,

226
00:12:46,64 --> 00:12:48,68
used to kill millions of people a year.

227
00:12:49,51 --> 00:12:51,89
So where does this current pandemic fall?

228
00:12:52,27 --> 00:12:53,52
It's not clear yet,

229
00:12:53,85 --> 00:12:56,77
but experts place it
somewhere around here.

230
00:12:56,85 --> 00:13:00,40
Deadlier than the measles,
but less contagious.

231
00:13:00,94 --> 00:13:03,11
Far less deadly than Ebola,

232
00:13:03,44 --> 00:13:05,99
and nowhere near as bad as smallpox.

233
00:13:06,53 --> 00:13:10,03
It's close to the lower estimates
for the 1918 flu.

234
00:13:10,58 --> 00:13:12,37
So, it could be worse.

235
00:13:13,04 --> 00:13:16,92
But its balance is just bad enough
to be devastating.

236
00:13:20,42 --> 00:13:23,05
But that doesn't mean
we're doomed to repeat history.

237
00:13:23,80 --> 00:13:27,05
We can end pandemics.
We've done it before.

238
00:13:28,01 --> 00:13:31,14
In the 20th century,
we discovered antibiotics.

239
00:13:32,01 --> 00:13:37,52
So the Bubonic Plague and all these other
bacterial diseases became far less deadly.

240
00:13:38,73 --> 00:13:43,11
But antibiotics don't work against
this coronavirus, or any viruses.

241
00:13:43,98 --> 00:13:47,28
We have effective drugs for some of them,
like HIV...

242
00:13:48,11 --> 00:13:51,28
which can now be far less contagious
and deadly.

243
00:13:52,20 --> 00:13:55,87
But safe antiviral drugs
are really hard to develop.

244
00:13:55,96 --> 00:13:59,79
So the best way to defeat a virus
is through immunity.

245
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:03,25
When certain viruses spread
through a population,

246
00:14:03,34 --> 00:14:05,05
some infected people die...

247
00:14:05,84 --> 00:14:07,22
but others survive.

248
00:14:07,84 --> 00:14:12,10
Their immune systems have learned
to recognize the virus and fight it off.

249
00:14:13,35 --> 00:14:18,06
When that happens in enough people,
it's much harder for the virus to spread.

250
00:14:18,85 --> 00:14:20,98
This is called herd immunity.

251
00:14:22,40 --> 00:14:24,23
The rate of infection slows.

252
00:14:24,98 --> 00:14:26,61
[Daszak] And the virus dies out.

253
00:14:27,36 --> 00:14:29,07
[narrator] But with COVID-19,

254
00:14:29,15 --> 00:14:32,87
if the world just waited
to achieve herd immunity naturally,

255
00:14:33,53 --> 00:14:34,95
millions would die,

256
00:14:35,66 --> 00:14:39,12
and other coronaviruses
don't even give lifelong immunity.

257
00:14:39,21 --> 00:14:41,71
For this one, we just don't know yet.

258
00:14:44,75 --> 00:14:48,63
Which makes it even more crucial
that we create a vaccine.

259
00:14:49,68 --> 00:14:51,39
If enough people get vaccinated,

260
00:14:51,47 --> 00:14:55,51
it's a safe and life-saving shortcut
to herd immunity.

261
00:14:56,18 --> 00:14:59,06
The first vaccine was created
to fight smallpox.

262
00:14:59,85 --> 00:15:04,57
And in 1980, after a massive
global vaccination campaign,

263
00:15:04,65 --> 00:15:10,74
smallpox was the first virus ever
declared eradicated from the world.

264
00:15:10,82 --> 00:15:14,58
And these diseases don't cause
nearly the amount of deaths they used to.

265
00:15:15,49 --> 00:15:18,58
But vaccines are also
really hard to develop.

266
00:15:18,83 --> 00:15:23,25
It's gonna take a year to a year
and a half to really know if it works.

267
00:15:23,33 --> 00:15:27,96
[narrator] And while we wait,
the virus keeps spreading and killing.

268
00:15:28,46 --> 00:15:30,84
So the best we can do is slow it down,

269
00:15:30,93 --> 00:15:33,76
using a method that's
a lot more old school.

270
00:15:34,35 --> 00:15:36,68
In fact, it was invented
seven centuries ago

271
00:15:36,76 --> 00:15:38,39
during the Black Death:

272
00:15:38,47 --> 00:15:39,35
quarantine.

273
00:15:40,52 --> 00:15:43,77
Or its gentler cousin,
"social distancing":

274
00:15:44,10 --> 00:15:47,02
avoiding crowds and
close contact with other people

275
00:15:47,11 --> 00:15:49,57
so the virus has fewer chances to spread.

276
00:15:50,44 --> 00:15:53,49
During the 1918 flu, one American city,

277
00:15:53,57 --> 00:15:55,78
St. Louis, took that approach quickly,

278
00:15:55,87 --> 00:15:58,12
shutting its schools and public places,

279
00:15:58,58 --> 00:16:00,87
while Philadelphia didn't right away,

280
00:16:00,96 --> 00:16:03,37
and allowed a big parade to go ahead.

281
00:16:04,88 --> 00:16:07,17
This was the death rate in St. Louis.

282
00:16:08,34 --> 00:16:10,17
And this was Philadelphia's.

283
00:16:11,55 --> 00:16:13,51
St. Louis flattened their curve,

284
00:16:13,59 --> 00:16:17,10
which means the disease killed people
for a longer period,

285
00:16:17,18 --> 00:16:18,39
but fewer died.

286
00:16:20,85 --> 00:16:23,52
Because, as Italy learned in March,

287
00:16:23,60 --> 00:16:26,44
it's much harder for hospitals
to save lives

288
00:16:26,52 --> 00:16:29,11
if too many people get infected at once.

289
00:16:30,94 --> 00:16:34,03
[in Italian]
I’m living in the hospital, literally.

290
00:16:34,11 --> 00:16:38,45
I sleep in the office and I live here.

291
00:16:38,53 --> 00:16:42,29
[woman speaking Italian]
Such concentrated and intense suffering.

292
00:16:43,12 --> 00:16:44,92
I've never seen this much of it
in my life.

293
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:46,63
[in English] People are critical.

294
00:16:46,71 --> 00:16:50,71
When you arrive at this point,
you realize that you are not enough.

295
00:16:52,01 --> 00:16:54,43
[narrator] We obviously
want to avoid that,

296
00:16:54,51 --> 00:16:57,76
which is why many world leaders
have made the same plea.

297
00:16:58,22 --> 00:17:01,14
Go home and stay home.

298
00:17:01,60 --> 00:17:03,35
You must stay at home.

299
00:17:03,43 --> 00:17:05,44
[in Hindi] During this time,

300
00:17:05,77 --> 00:17:09,77
no Indian citizen
should step out of their home.

301
00:17:11,03 --> 00:17:13,61
[narrator in English] Hundreds of millions
of people around the world

302
00:17:13,69 --> 00:17:15,24
have been waiting this out...

303
00:17:15,78 --> 00:17:17,36
finding ways to cope.

304
00:17:18,82 --> 00:17:20,28
[banging on pots]

305
00:17:20,37 --> 00:17:21,83
[music playing on speakers]

306
00:17:21,91 --> 00:17:27,75
So countries really have to go on
a hardcore national lockdown

307
00:17:27,83 --> 00:17:29,88
to really suppress that curve,

308
00:17:29,96 --> 00:17:31,71
and then we have to, at some point,

309
00:17:31,80 --> 00:17:34,47
gradually and carefully
come out of that lockdown.

310
00:17:37,63 --> 00:17:40,68
[narrator] South Korea is one model.
As of early April,

311
00:17:40,76 --> 00:17:43,72
they've managed to rein in their outbreak
without a lockdown

312
00:17:44,18 --> 00:17:48,98
by testing widely and retracing the steps
of people who came back positive.

313
00:17:49,69 --> 00:17:51,69
For other places to pull off
something similar,

314
00:17:51,77 --> 00:17:53,94
they'd need to ramp up their testing.

315
00:17:54,03 --> 00:17:57,78
At what point on the other side
of the curve do you go back to work?

316
00:17:57,86 --> 00:18:01,53
There is no answer. I think
the answer's gonna be in testing.

317
00:18:01,62 --> 00:18:05,00
If you could test, today,
millions of people,

318
00:18:05,08 --> 00:18:07,46
you could send them
to work tomorrow, right?

319
00:18:07,54 --> 00:18:09,58
The problem is if we're not careful,

320
00:18:09,92 --> 00:18:12,63
that smoldering outbreak
can last a long time.

321
00:18:13,55 --> 00:18:15,05
[narrator] Remember St. Louis?

322
00:18:15,13 --> 00:18:17,13
Right there, in November,

323
00:18:17,22 --> 00:18:21,35
is when the city decided to end
their social distancing policies.

324
00:18:21,43 --> 00:18:25,10
The death rate jumped,
and the city quickly locked down again.

325
00:18:26,56 --> 00:18:28,44
In a pandemic like this,

326
00:18:28,52 --> 00:18:30,65
until you have a vaccine,

327
00:18:30,73 --> 00:18:32,36
you have limited options,

328
00:18:32,73 --> 00:18:34,90
because the virus had a head start.

329
00:18:35,65 --> 00:18:39,20
And this is a situation
that experts have always feared.

330
00:18:39,28 --> 00:18:41,74
Mother Nature is
the ultimate bioterrorist.

331
00:18:41,82 --> 00:18:44,99
There are always going to be things
that surprise us

332
00:18:45,08 --> 00:18:47,25
and that take our detection by surprise.

333
00:18:47,33 --> 00:18:52,79
[Gates] We could be far more ready
for a pandemic like a flu or a SARS.

334
00:18:52,88 --> 00:18:58,30
However, if a really fast-moving
respiratory pathogen came out,

335
00:18:58,59 --> 00:19:02,80
no, we wouldn't be able
to hold those numbers down.

336
00:19:03,51 --> 00:19:07,06
[narrator] The World Health Organization
is meant to lead the global response

337
00:19:07,14 --> 00:19:09,52
to a pandemic like this.

338
00:19:09,60 --> 00:19:12,10
But it's actually
quite a small organization,

339
00:19:12,19 --> 00:19:15,73
very dependent on voluntary contributions.

340
00:19:15,82 --> 00:19:19,24
So they don't have planes
or teams standing by.

341
00:19:19,32 --> 00:19:22,20
They don't have
a research and development budget

342
00:19:22,28 --> 00:19:23,32
to make these tools.

343
00:19:24,20 --> 00:19:28,29
[narrator] In 2005, the WHO did draw up
a huge blueprint

344
00:19:28,37 --> 00:19:32,54
for how the world should prepare
and respond to a crisis like this.

345
00:19:33,04 --> 00:19:33,96
Among other things,

346
00:19:34,38 --> 00:19:38,01
countries had to develop
the capacity to detect outbreaks

347
00:19:38,09 --> 00:19:40,63
and quickly notify WHO.

348
00:19:41,05 --> 00:19:44,30
One hundred and ninety-six countries
signed onto this,

349
00:19:44,47 --> 00:19:46,43
but most never complied.

350
00:19:46,89 --> 00:19:50,27
When a pandemic comes along of any size,

351
00:19:50,35 --> 00:19:53,48
we always look back
and wish we'd invested more.

352
00:19:53,56 --> 00:19:57,07
However, very quickly our memory fades,

353
00:19:57,15 --> 00:20:00,78
and other priorities
are getting the resources.

354
00:20:01,28 --> 00:20:04,20
[narrator] A recent WHO report
even acknowledged,

355
00:20:04,28 --> 00:20:06,41
"There is a very real threat

356
00:20:06,49 --> 00:20:11,58
of a rapidly moving, highly lethal
pandemic of a respiratory pathogen.

357
00:20:11,66 --> 00:20:13,92
The world is not prepared."

358
00:20:14,54 --> 00:20:18,30
That was three months
before the first case of COVID-19.

359
00:20:19,59 --> 00:20:22,67
And our healthcare systems
obviously weren't prepared.

360
00:20:23,47 --> 00:20:27,76
Doctors and nurses around the world
have been forced to use makeshift masks.

361
00:20:28,10 --> 00:20:30,97
[in Spanish] In the last two days,
eight nurses have fallen ill.

362
00:20:31,06 --> 00:20:32,85
[in English] Healthcare professionals
are sick.

363
00:20:32,94 --> 00:20:36,10
We need to be protected first
so that we'll be able to help.

364
00:20:36,65 --> 00:20:39,78
[narrator] And in China,
many of the first people with COVID-19

365
00:20:39,86 --> 00:20:42,53
appear to have caught the disease
at a hospital.

366
00:20:42,95 --> 00:20:46,66
Well, the world spends a lot of money
preparing for war.

367
00:20:46,74 --> 00:20:50,62
Military budgets are large,
and the new weapons get created.

368
00:20:50,70 --> 00:20:53,66
This belongs right there with war,

369
00:20:54,12 --> 00:20:56,33
as something that we plan for.

370
00:20:57,46 --> 00:21:00,25
[narrator] We also need to do more
 to prevent outbreaks

371
00:21:00,34 --> 00:21:02,38
from happening in the first place.

372
00:21:02,84 --> 00:21:04,76
Live animal markets like this

373
00:21:04,84 --> 00:21:08,22
have remained popular in parts of China
and other countries,

374
00:21:08,80 --> 00:21:13,89
giving animal viruses all kinds
of opportunities to mix and mutate

375
00:21:13,98 --> 00:21:15,31
and jump to humans.

376
00:21:16,77 --> 00:21:20,73
And when there is an outbreak,
we need to respond faster.

377
00:21:21,82 --> 00:21:26,41
Three weeks before China began any
containment measures against COVID-19...

378
00:21:27,45 --> 00:21:30,91
a 33-year-old doctor
at Wuhan Central Hospital,

379
00:21:30,99 --> 00:21:32,45
Doctor Li Wenliang,

380
00:21:33,00 --> 00:21:35,12
sent a group chat to other doctors,

381
00:21:35,21 --> 00:21:37,29
alerting them to the outbreak.

382
00:21:37,83 --> 00:21:41,46
A few days later, the Wuhan police
made him sign a letter,

383
00:21:41,55 --> 00:21:45,30
warning that he would receive
the full sanction of the law

384
00:21:45,63 --> 00:21:49,26
if he "stubbornly persists"
in his opinions.

385
00:21:50,80 --> 00:21:55,18
By the time the WHO declared
a public health emergency on January 30th,

386
00:21:55,77 --> 00:22:00,19
Dr. Li Wenliang had likely
already contracted COVID-19...

387
00:22:01,27 --> 00:22:03,36
because he died of it a week later.

388
00:22:04,82 --> 00:22:06,28
And three weeks after that,

389
00:22:06,36 --> 00:22:10,87
it's estimated that
114,000 people in China were infected.

390
00:22:11,53 --> 00:22:15,95
If China had implemented its containment
measures just one week earlier,

391
00:22:16,41 --> 00:22:19,17
researchers found
it would have looked like this.

392
00:22:20,33 --> 00:22:22,75
Two weeks earlier, like this.

393
00:22:24,21 --> 00:22:25,88
And three weeks earlier,

394
00:22:26,63 --> 00:22:27,72
like this.

395
00:22:28,68 --> 00:22:33,60
The number of cases could have been cut
by as much as 95%.

396
00:22:35,85 --> 00:22:38,44
And while China was locked down
in February,

397
00:22:38,52 --> 00:22:39,81
Italy wasn't,

398
00:22:39,90 --> 00:22:42,77
and it became the next epicenter
of the virus.

399
00:22:43,69 --> 00:22:45,98
And when Italy locked down in March,

400
00:22:46,07 --> 00:22:47,49
the United States didn't,

401
00:22:48,20 --> 00:22:50,11
and became the next epicenter.

402
00:22:51,24 --> 00:22:53,95
And then cases started to rise
 in poorer countries

403
00:22:54,03 --> 00:22:55,58
where lockdowns are harder,

404
00:22:55,99 --> 00:22:58,46
and healthcare systems, already fragile.

405
00:22:59,75 --> 00:23:02,50
We need to get faster at containment.

406
00:23:04,00 --> 00:23:07,38
Ideally, we want to catch more viruses
at the source.

407
00:23:07,84 --> 00:23:09,63
It isn't just China,

408
00:23:09,72 --> 00:23:11,22
and it isn't just bats.

409
00:23:12,18 --> 00:23:16,77
These are the places where a new virus
is most likely to make the leap to humans.

410
00:23:17,64 --> 00:23:21,81
The frontline for disease emergence
are places like

411
00:23:21,90 --> 00:23:24,52
the end of the road in a tropical forest

412
00:23:24,61 --> 00:23:27,57
where someone's just built
a new mining concession.

413
00:23:27,65 --> 00:23:28,78
People have moved in,

414
00:23:28,86 --> 00:23:31,45
there's no food supply,
so they go out and hunt wildlife.

415
00:23:31,78 --> 00:23:36,12
Or it's a farm in Southeast Asia
that's been expanding and intensifying,

416
00:23:36,62 --> 00:23:40,58
that has bats nearby that spread viruses
into the pigs in the farm.

417
00:23:41,42 --> 00:23:44,17
[narrator] The truth is, human behavior
all over the world

418
00:23:44,25 --> 00:23:46,63
has made pandemics
like this one inevitable.

419
00:23:47,42 --> 00:23:51,55
Deforestation is bringing more wild
animals into contact with more people,

420
00:23:51,63 --> 00:23:55,39
and factory farming is pushing animals
closer together,

421
00:23:55,89 --> 00:24:00,52
giving their viruses more opportunities
to combine into one that could infect us.

422
00:24:01,52 --> 00:24:04,52
Then we give them more ways than ever
to spread.

423
00:24:05,02 --> 00:24:08,02
[Daszak] I think one of the big lessons
about pandemics is,

424
00:24:08,11 --> 00:24:11,19
we think that it's something happening
over there.

425
00:24:11,28 --> 00:24:12,70
Well, we know from COVID-19

426
00:24:12,78 --> 00:24:15,45
that what happens over there
can very easily get here.

427
00:24:18,33 --> 00:24:20,95
[narrator] But if viruses
were capable of thinking,

428
00:24:21,41 --> 00:24:23,58
they should have also
learned their lesson.

429
00:24:24,21 --> 00:24:26,13
If their goal is to replicate,

430
00:24:26,59 --> 00:24:28,25
they shouldn't start killing us.

431
00:24:29,05 --> 00:24:31,59
Because once a virus becomes a pandemic,

432
00:24:32,26 --> 00:24:35,89
all of human ingenuity will be
brought to bear to bring them down.

433
00:24:36,39 --> 00:24:38,47
We should have been more prepared,

434
00:24:39,14 --> 00:24:43,31
but when it comes to technology,
science, and coordination,

435
00:24:43,64 --> 00:24:46,10
we've also never been more prepared.

436
00:24:46,69 --> 00:24:50,86
This new virus was identified within days.
The sequence was shared a few days later,

437
00:24:50,94 --> 00:24:53,61
and because of that, testing began,

438
00:24:53,70 --> 00:24:55,20
really, across the globe.

439
00:24:55,28 --> 00:25:00,12
Scientists around the world are committing
entire labs to creating a vaccine.

440
00:25:00,20 --> 00:25:04,79
The... the fastest vaccine
ever created, um, in history.

441
00:25:04,87 --> 00:25:06,79
[reporter] The world's
fastest supercomputer

442
00:25:06,88 --> 00:25:08,75
has run thousands of simulations

443
00:25:08,84 --> 00:25:13,34
and identified 77 drug compounds
that might effectively stop the virus.

444
00:25:13,42 --> 00:25:17,30
It's amazing the way the scientific
community has gathered together.

445
00:25:17,55 --> 00:25:19,22
[narrator] We know what it takes,

446
00:25:19,30 --> 00:25:22,60
because we've been in this race
since life on Earth began,

447
00:25:22,89 --> 00:25:25,19
and a virus hasn't beaten us yet.

448
00:25:26,14 --> 00:25:28,73

449
00:25:30,61 --> 00:25:33,65
