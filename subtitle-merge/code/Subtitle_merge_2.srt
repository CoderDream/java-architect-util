‎这些疫情在全世界范围内
These outbreaks caused panic around the world,

‎但是专家们依旧非常担忧
But experts, they stayed worried.

‎那么 在所有病毒中
[narrator] So, of all the viruses out there, why did this one

49
00:02:58,09 --> 00:03:01,51
‎为什么这次会变成一次大流行呢？

54
00:02:59,47 --> 00:03:03,68
end up becoming the kind of pandemic we haven't seen in more than a century?

50
00:03:01,59 --> 00:03:03,47
‎已经一个多世纪没有发生过了
end up becoming the kind of pandemic we haven't seen in more than a century?

51

‎我们深感忧虑
[Tedros Ghebreyesus] We're deeply concerned

54
00:03:14,44 --> 00:03:18,53
‎病毒传播速度 ‎以及不作为的情况十分惊人
by the alarming levels of spread and inaction.

59
00:03:15,06 --> 00:03:18,53
by the alarming levels of spread and inaction.

55
00:03:18,99 --> 00:03:21,86
‎COVID-19是一种流行病
COVID-19 is a pandemic.

60
00:03:19,03 --> 00:03:21,86
COVID-19 is a pandemic.

56
00:03:21,95 --> 00:03:24,66
‎全球病例继续增加
[Anthony Fauci] The cases continue to increase globally.

57
00:03:25,24 --> 00:03:27,49
‎我们要做的 就是让疫情放缓
What we need to do is flatten that down.

58
00:03:28,62 --> 00:03:31,16
‎发展中国家将会爆发疫情
[Daszak] We're going to have outbreaks in developing countries

59
00:03:31,25 --> 00:03:32,50
‎而且会越来越严重
that are just going to be raging.

60
00:03:34,13 --> 00:03:39,09
‎只有公众合作 ‎抗击传染病的运动才能取得成功
[man] The campaign against infectious disease can succeed

66
00:03:37,34 --> 00:03:39,13
only if the public cooperates.

61
00:03:39,76 --> 00:03:43,64
‎剧名：这场全球大流行病

62
00:03:46,43 --> 00:03:48,93
‎病毒是地球上最早的生物之一…
[narrator] Viruses were one of the first living things on Earth...

63
00:03:49,72 --> 00:03:52,14
‎但它们的生存机制跟我们不同
but they're not alive like we are.

64
00:03:53,02 --> 00:03:56,15
‎它们需要劫持其他活细胞来繁殖
They need to hijack other living cells to reproduce,

65
00:03:56,23 --> 00:03:58,23
‎这是它们唯一的目标
and that's their only goal,

66
00:03:58,32 --> 00:04:00,99
‎生存和自我复制
to survive and replicate themselves.

67
00:04:01,95 --> 00:04:06,03
‎这种病毒的官方名称是SARS-CoV-2

‎"COVID-19"是其引起的疾病的名字
"COVID-19" is the name of the disease it causes,

69
00:04:11,12 --> 00:04:14,79
‎意指“2019年冠状病毒疾病”
which stands for "Coronavirus disease 2019."

70
00:04:16,00 --> 00:04:18,25
‎冠状是“王冠”的意思
Corona, as in "crown."

71
00:04:18,34 --> 00:04:21,59
‎这种病毒以其冠状突起而得名
The virus is named for its crown-like spikes.

72
00:04:22,72 --> 00:04:26,22
‎当我们打喷嚏、咳嗽或说话时 ‎它通过飞沫传播
It spreads through droplets when we sneeze, cough, or speak,

73
00:04:26,84 --> 00:04:30,52
‎可以通过我们的眼睛、鼻子或嘴巴 ‎直接进入我们体内
and can enter us directly through our eyes, nose, or mouth.

74
00:04:31,10 --> 00:04:34,69
‎病毒也可以在很多表面存活数小时
The virus can also live on a lot of surfaces for hours,

75
00:04:35,14 --> 00:04:37,31
‎所以人们会用手沾上病毒
so people can pick it up on their hands

76
00:04:37,40 --> 00:04:39,90
‎如果触摸自己的脸 就会感染自己
and infect themselves if they touch their face,

77
00:04:40,90 --> 00:04:45,28
‎一般人每小时会摸脸20次
something the average person does 20 times an hour.

78
00:04:46,91 --> 00:04:50,45
‎一旦进入体内 ‎这些突起就像一把钥匙
Once inside the body, those spikes act as a key,

83
00:04:47,20 --> 00:04:50,45
Once inside the body, those spikes act as a key,

79
00:04:50,54 --> 00:04:54,62
‎锁定在许多人类细胞外部的蛋白质上
locking onto the proteins found on the outside of many human cells.

80
00:04:55,54 --> 00:04:56,83
‎一旦病毒侵入
Once it's broken in,

81
00:04:56,92 --> 00:05:01,09
‎它就会给细胞指令 ‎让细胞复制更多的自己
the virus gives the cell instructions to produce more copies of itself,

82
00:05:01,25 --> 00:05:03,97
‎进而侵入越来越多的细胞
potentially invading more and more cells,

83
00:05:04,92 --> 00:05:08,47
‎导致发烧、咳嗽和乏力
which can lead to a fever, a cough, and fatigue,

84
00:05:08,93 --> 00:05:10,26
‎但也不总是如此
but not always.

85
00:05:10,35 --> 00:05:13,77
‎也可能导致这些症状
And it potentially leads to any of these symptoms, too.

86
00:05:14,06 --> 00:05:15,69
‎研究还在进行之中
Research is ongoing.

87
00:05:16,98 --> 00:05:21,15
‎你可能感染并传播 而没有任何症状
And you can be infected and spread it without any symptoms,

88
00:05:21,23 --> 00:05:23,28
‎或者可能被误认为是流感
or they can be mistaken for the flu.

89
00:05:24,65 --> 00:05:27,82
‎这就是这种冠状病毒如此狡猾的原因
That's what makes this coronavirus so devious.

90
00:05:30,33 --> 00:05:34,00
‎引发重大疾病的病毒 ‎通常具有如下特点
So the most significant diseases are often caused by viruses that

91
00:05:34,08 --> 00:05:37,25
‎症状不明显 病程缓慢 ‎例如艾滋病毒
are silent and slow, like HIV,

92
00:05:37,33 --> 00:05:41,67
‎或者发病很快 引起咳嗽、发烧等
or move very rapidly and cause symptoms like coughing and fever

93
00:05:41,75 --> 00:05:43,63
‎可能与其他疾病混淆的症状
that could be confused with other diseases.

94
00:05:44,34 --> 00:05:47,34
‎在日常生活中 一个冠状病毒携带者
[narrator] Going about their life, a person with this coronavirus

95
00:05:47,43 --> 00:05:49,59
‎可能会感染几个人
likely infects a couple other people,

96
00:05:49,93 --> 00:05:52,76
‎每个被感染者又会感染几个人
and each of those people infects a couple more,

97
00:05:52,85 --> 00:05:54,85
‎如此反复
and so on, and so on,

98
00:05:55,52 --> 00:05:59,52
‎所以病例数才会呈指数曲线增长
which is why the number of cases increases on an exponential curve,

99
00:05:59,90 --> 00:06:01,90
‎每过几天 数量就会翻倍
doubling every several days.

100
00:06:03,02 --> 00:06:06,36
‎其中一些人会患上严重的肺部感染
Then some of those people will end up with a severe lung infection,

106
00:06:06,90 --> 00:06:09,70
and certain groups are especially at risk.

101
00:06:07,40 --> 00:06:09,70
‎某些群体的风险尤其高
and certain groups are especially at risk.

102
00:06:11,20 --> 00:06:15,16
‎在美国一项样本中 ‎约四分之三的住院患者
In one US sample, around three-quarters of people who were hospitalized

103
00:06:15,24 --> 00:06:17,62
‎至少有一种基础疾病
had at least one underlying health condition,

104
00:06:18,12 --> 00:06:21,25
‎比如肺病、心脏病或糖尿病
like lung disease, heart disease, or diabetes.

105
00:06:22,34 --> 00:06:24,96
‎虽然具体数字因国家而异
And while the exact numbers vary by country,

106
00:06:25,38 --> 00:06:28,97
‎但随着年龄增长 死亡风险明显增加
the risk of dying is clearly greater the older you get,

107
00:06:29,05 --> 00:06:32,60
‎如同这组数据所示 ‎这是疫情爆发两个月后
as you can see in this data that Hubei, China reported

108
00:06:32,68 --> 00:06:34,64
‎中国湖北报告的数据
two months after their outbreak began.

109
00:06:35,14 --> 00:06:38,64
‎由于科学家们还不完全了解的原因
And for reasons scientists don't fully understand,

110
00:06:38,73 --> 00:06:41,23
‎男性感染的风险更高
the risk is also higher for men,

111
00:06:41,60 --> 00:06:44,44
‎可能是由于一些生理因素
possibly because of some biological factors,

112
00:06:44,52 --> 00:06:46,53
‎或者因为男性吸烟人数更多
or because they're more likely to smoke,

113
00:06:47,15 --> 00:06:50,15
‎还有一种原因 一些研究表明
or because men, according to some studies,

114
00:06:50,24 --> 00:06:52,87
‎男性更不喜欢洗手
aren't as good about washing their hands.

115
00:06:53,32 --> 00:06:54,33
‎说到这里…
On that note...

116
00:06:54,83 --> 00:06:57,29
‎尽可能勤洗手
Wash your hands as often as you possibly can,

117
00:06:57,37 --> 00:07:01,08
‎我知道大家不是总能方便做到洗手
and I know you're not always in a position to be able to wash your hands,

118
00:07:01,71 --> 00:07:03,50
‎但还是要尽量勤洗手
uh, but wash them as much as you can.

119
00:07:04,17 --> 00:07:05,09
‎这是很好的建议
[narrator] It's good advice.

120
00:07:05,84 --> 00:07:11,43
‎这种冠状病毒 ‎是已知感染人类的七种冠状病毒中
Now, this coronavirus is just the youngest in a whole family of seven coronaviruses

121
00:07:11,51 --> 00:07:13,09
‎最年轻的一种
known to infect humans.

122
00:07:13,72 --> 00:07:16,93
‎它现在像SARS和MERS一样出名了
It's now famous, as are SARS and MERS,

123
00:07:17,01 --> 00:07:18,89
‎因为已经导致很多人死亡
because they've killed a lot of people.

124
00:07:19,14 --> 00:07:22,65
‎但这四种病毒 ‎其实是更成功的病毒
But these four are actually more successful viruses.

125
00:07:23,02 --> 00:07:25,77
‎三分之一的普通感冒都是它们引起的
They cause up to a third of common colds.

126
00:07:26,15 --> 00:07:27,19
‎它们无处不在
They're everywhere.

127
00:07:28,40 --> 00:07:31,24
‎因为如果病毒不会导致宿主生病
Because viruses can actually be better at spreading

128
00:07:31,32 --> 00:07:33,99
‎那么传播会更加容易
if they don't make their host that sick.

129
00:07:35,28 --> 00:07:36,45
‎可以看看蝙蝠
Just look at bats.

130
00:07:36,53 --> 00:07:40,87
‎蝙蝠身上满是病毒 ‎因为病毒并不会影响它们
They're teeming with viruses because viruses don't really bother them.

131
00:07:41,83 --> 00:07:42,83
‎但是…
But...

132
00:07:42,92 --> 00:07:46,71
‎一旦进入人群 ‎就会变异成一种新的病毒
They can transform into a new virus once they get into the human population.

133
00:07:47,59 --> 00:07:51,05
‎科学家认为 2002年的SARS就是这样
[narrator] That's what scientists believe happened with SARS in 2002.

134
00:07:51,59 --> 00:07:53,18
‎就像这种冠状病毒一样
Just like this coronavirus,

135
00:07:53,26 --> 00:07:56,47
‎SARS也出现在中国的活畜市场
SARS emerged in a live animal market in China.

136
00:07:57,14 --> 00:07:59,43
‎由于它是一种新的人畜共患病毒
And since it was a new zoonotic virus,

137
00:07:59,52 --> 00:08:02,14
‎没有治疗方法 也没有疫苗
there were no treatments and no vaccine.

138
00:08:02,69 --> 00:08:06,40
‎但相比新型冠状病毒 ‎SARS的危险性要小得多
But SARS was a lot less dangerous than this coronavirus.

139
00:08:06,94 --> 00:08:09,23
‎只有在出现症状时 才会传播
People could only spread it when they had symptoms,

140
00:08:09,32 --> 00:08:11,28
‎所以更容易控制病毒传播
so it was easier to contain the virus by just quarantining people who were sick.

141
00:08:11,36 --> 00:08:14,03
‎只需隔离发病的患者即可
so it was easier to contain the virus by just quarantining people who were sick.

142
00:08:15,36 --> 00:08:17,45
‎SARS的致死率也高得多
SARS was also a lot more deadly,

143
00:08:17,53 --> 00:08:20,08
‎这也使得病毒更难传播
which made it harder for the virus to spread.

144
00:08:20,16 --> 00:08:23,79
‎像SARS这样的疾病 致死率在10%
[Daszak] A disease like SARS, it kills 10% of people it infects,

145
00:08:23,87 --> 00:08:27,96
‎幸存者可能会获得一些免疫力 ‎可以不再被感染
and then the survivors probably have some immunity and can't be reinfected.

146
00:08:28,63 --> 00:08:31,63
‎最终 只有拥有免疫的人
And eventually, the only people the virus can find

147
00:08:31,71 --> 00:08:33,59
‎才被发现携带病毒
are people who have immunity to it.

148
00:08:34,18 --> 00:08:39,47
‎SARS最终感染了 ‎至少29个国家的大约8000人
[narrator] In the end, SARS infected around 8,000 people

153
00:08:37,60 --> 00:08:39,47
in at least 29 countries.

149
00:08:39,72 --> 00:08:42,27
‎其中774人死亡
Seven hundred seventy-four of them died.

150
00:08:44,60 --> 00:08:47,06
‎从那时起 ‎一个名为生态健康联盟的组织
Since then, a group called EcoHealth Alliance

151
00:08:47,15 --> 00:08:49,57
‎来到中国南方的这些洞穴
has been coming to these caves in southern China,

152
00:08:50,11 --> 00:08:50,98
‎捕捉蝙蝠
catching bats,

153
00:08:51,28 --> 00:08:53,11
‎检测它们的病毒
scanning them for viruses,

154
00:08:53,19 --> 00:08:56,95
‎标记那些最容易感染人类的病毒
and flagging the ones that could most easily make the leap to us.

155
00:08:57,03 --> 00:08:59,70
‎发现病毒以后 我们会启动警报
[Daszak] And when we find them, we raise the alert,

156
00:08:59,78 --> 00:09:01,58
‎中国政府会参与进来
and the government of China comes in

157
00:09:01,66 --> 00:09:05,46
‎努力减少人群对病毒的接触
and tries to reduce the exposure of those populations to viruses.

158
00:09:06,12 --> 00:09:10,46
‎到目前为止 他们发现了很多病毒 ‎包括数百种冠状病毒
[narrator] They've found a lot so far, including hundreds of coronaviruses.

159
00:09:11,55 --> 00:09:13,67
‎他们将其标记为高风险或低风险
And they label them as high risk or low risk,

160
00:09:13,76 --> 00:09:17,93
‎标准是与已经感染人类的病毒 ‎相似程度有多高
depending on how similar they are to viruses that already infect humans.

161
00:09:18,59 --> 00:09:21,01
‎几年前 他们发现了一种病毒
And a few years ago, they discovered one that they called

162
00:09:21,10 --> 00:09:25,14
‎他们称之为“蝙蝠冠状病毒RaTG13”
"bat coronavirus RaTG13,"

163
00:09:25,23 --> 00:09:27,73
‎符合低风险标准
which met the criteria for low-risk.

164
00:09:28,27 --> 00:09:33,07
‎当科学家们对COVID-19的病毒基因组 ‎进行测序时
When scientists sequenced the genome of the virus behind COVID-19,

165
00:09:33,15 --> 00:09:38,49
‎他们发现有96%与蝙蝠病毒相同
they found that 96% of it was identical to that bat virus.

166
00:09:39,49 --> 00:09:43,62
‎科学家们认为 ‎可能是蝙蝠病毒进化成了这种新病毒
Scientists believe the bat virus likely evolved into this new virus

167
00:09:43,70 --> 00:09:45,37
‎进而感染人类
that could infect humans.

168
00:09:47,25 --> 00:09:49,79
‎所以我们回去找了达什亚克医生
So we had to go back to Dr. Daszak.

169
00:09:49,88 --> 00:09:54,05
‎当时 我们的目标 ‎是发现与SARS相关的病毒
At the time, our goal was to find SARS-related viruses.

170
00:09:54,13 --> 00:09:55,46
‎这种病毒看起来相差甚远
This one looked too distant.

171
00:09:55,55 --> 00:09:57,80
‎我们认为它不会进入人群
We didn't think it would be able to get into people.

172
00:09:57,88 --> 00:10:00,26
‎看起来不像是迫在眉睫的明确危险
It didn't look like it was a clear and present danger.

173
00:10:00,34 --> 00:10:01,18
‎非常遗憾
Unfortunate.

174
00:10:02,51 --> 00:10:06,39
‎想要预测病毒进化的所有方式 ‎是不可能的
[narrator] It's impossible to predict all the ways a virus might evolve.

175
00:10:06,89 --> 00:10:10,31
‎科学家们认为 这种病毒 ‎可能在另一种蝙蝠身上发生了突变
Scientists believe this one may have mutated in another bat...

180
00:10:07,14 --> 00:10:10,31
Scientists believe this one may have mutated in another bat...

176
00:10:11,44 --> 00:10:15,03
‎或者在感染人类前 ‎先感染了另一个物种
or it may have jumped to another species before jumping to us,

177
00:10:15,11 --> 00:10:17,49
‎比如穿山甲或蛇…
like a pangolin or a snake...

178
00:10:18,53 --> 00:10:19,57
‎或鱼
or a fish.

179
00:10:21,82 --> 00:10:26,66
‎一个多世纪以前 ‎堪萨斯州的一个农场发生过类似意外
That same kind of fluke happened on a farm in Kansas over a century ago.

180
00:10:27,25 --> 00:10:28,71
‎专家们并不确定
Experts aren't certain,

181
00:10:28,79 --> 00:10:32,25
‎但他们认为 1918年的流感大流行
but they believe the 1918 flu pandemic could have started

182
00:10:32,34 --> 00:10:36,84
‎可能是感染流感的鸟类 ‎跟感染流感的人类 接触过同一只猪
when a bird with the flu and a human with the flu met the same pig.

183
00:10:37,42 --> 00:10:39,76
‎禽流感不会感染人类
The bird flu couldn't infect humans,

184
00:10:39,84 --> 00:10:42,43
‎人类流感也不会感染禽类
and the human flu couldn't infect birds,

185
00:10:42,51 --> 00:10:46,22
‎但在猪的细胞中 这两种病毒结合
but in one of the pig's cells, those two viruses combined,

186
00:10:46,31 --> 00:10:48,43
‎产生了一种新型人畜共患病毒
creating a new zoonotic virus,

187
00:10:48,52 --> 00:10:50,56
‎H1N1
H1N1,

188
00:10:50,65 --> 00:10:53,98
‎这种新病毒肯定会感染人类
and that new virus definitely could infect humans.

189
00:10:54,65 --> 00:10:57,36
‎这次历史事件是史无前例的
It was unlike anything else in history.

190
00:10:59,90 --> 00:11:02,11
‎一种疾病想要成为流行病
[narrator] For a disease to become a pandemic,

191
00:11:02,20 --> 00:11:07,29
‎在几个月内在全世界蔓延 ‎导致数百万人死亡
spreading around the world in months, leading to potentially millions of deaths,

192
00:11:07,37 --> 00:11:10,37
‎它必须在传染性和致命性之间
it has to find an extraordinary balance...

193
00:11:10,92 --> 00:11:13,83
‎找到一种完美平衡
of contagiousness and deadliness.

198
00:11:11,21 --> 00:11:13,83
of contagiousness and deadliness.

194
00:11:14,25 --> 00:11:17,17
‎可以从这两个维度来考虑一种疾病
You can think of a disease on those two scales.

195
00:11:17,84 --> 00:11:20,01
‎这些是一些传染病
And these are some of the infectious diseases

196
00:11:20,09 --> 00:11:22,39
‎它们是人类最大的敌人
that have been humanity's greatest foes.

197
00:11:23,22 --> 00:11:25,22
‎这是人类季节性流感
Here's the seasonal human flu,

198
00:11:25,85 --> 00:11:27,60
‎这是禽流感
while this is the bird flu.

199
00:11:28,43 --> 00:11:32,77
‎1918年的流感在这个范围的某个地方
And somewhere in this range was the 1918 combination.

200
00:11:34,31 --> 00:11:35,56
‎病毒通过空气传播
It was airborne,

201
00:11:36,15 --> 00:11:40,07
‎意味着这种病毒可以悬浮在空气中 ‎感染任何吸入的人
meaning the virus could hang in the air, infecting anyone who inhaled it.

202
00:11:41,53 --> 00:11:46,53
‎据估计 全球有三分之一的人口 ‎感染了这种病毒
And it's estimated that it infected one in every three people on Earth,

203
00:11:46,95 --> 00:11:51,96
‎导致3-20%的感染者死亡
and then it killed anywhere from three to 20% of those infected.

204
00:11:52,37 --> 00:11:55,08
‎当时的医疗记录并不完备
Medical record-keeping was not great at that time.

205
00:11:56,04 --> 00:11:58,63
‎但跟天花比起来 ‎这种病毒根本不算什么
But that was nothing compared to smallpox,

206
00:11:59,05 --> 00:12:02,17
‎天花的致死率为30%
which killed 30% of the people who got it,

207
00:12:02,55 --> 00:12:04,47
‎也更具传染性
and was also more contagious.

208
00:12:05,64 --> 00:12:09,18
‎几千年间 天花病毒都令人类恐惧
That virus terrorized humanity for thousands of years.

209
00:12:09,72 --> 00:12:11,31
‎仅在20世纪
In the 20th century alone,

210
00:12:11,39 --> 00:12:14,44
‎就夺去了数亿人的生命
it killed hundreds of millions of people.

211
00:12:15,23 --> 00:12:17,90
‎还有更致命的埃博拉病毒
And then there's Ebola, which is even deadlier.

212
00:12:18,44 --> 00:12:20,74
‎但埃博拉的致死人数少很多
But far fewer people have died from it,

213
00:12:20,82 --> 00:12:23,03
‎部分原因是因为致死率太高
in part because it's so deadly,

214
00:12:23,11 --> 00:12:26,78
‎感染埃博拉病毒的人不会感染很多人 ‎因为他们病得很重
people who have it don't infect too many others because they get so sick,

215
00:12:27,16 --> 00:12:28,08
‎只能留在家中
they stay home,

216
00:12:28,62 --> 00:12:30,58
‎最终都走向死亡
and then most don't survive.

217
00:12:31,41 --> 00:12:34,54
‎关于病毒 有一件令人意想不到的事
One of the unexpected things about viruses is that sometimes,

218
00:12:35,00 --> 00:12:39,09
‎症状明显、致死率高的病毒
a virus that has really obvious symptoms, that kills people at a very high rate,

219
00:12:39,17 --> 00:12:41,92
‎通常不会爆发 它做不到
doesn't become a pandemic. It can't do that.

220
00:12:42,34 --> 00:12:46,30
‎而像麻疹这样的疾病 ‎其致死率远低于埃博拉病毒
[narrator] While a disease like measles, which is far less deadly than Ebola,

221
00:12:46,64 --> 00:12:48,68
‎曾经每年导致数百万人死亡
used to kill millions of people a year.

222
00:12:49,51 --> 00:12:51,89
‎那么 当前的流行病在什么位置呢？
So where does this current pandemic fall?

223
00:12:52,22 --> 00:12:53,31
‎目前还不清楚
It's not clear yet,

224
00:12:53,85 --> 00:12:56,77
‎但专家们把它放在了这块区域
but experts place it somewhere around here.

225
00:12:56,85 --> 00:13:00,40
‎比麻疹更致命 但传染性更小
Deadlier than the measles, but less contagious.

226
00:13:00,94 --> 00:13:03,11
‎远没有埃博拉致命
Far less deadly than Ebola,

227
00:13:03,44 --> 00:13:05,99
‎也远没有天花那么糟糕
and nowhere near as bad as smallpox.

228
00:13:06,53 --> 00:13:10,03
‎接近于对1918年流感的较低估计
It's close to the lower estimates for the 1918 flu.

229
00:13:10,58 --> 00:13:12,37
‎所以情况可能会更糟
So, it could be worse.

230
00:13:13,04 --> 00:13:16,87
‎但病毒的平衡性 ‎足以造成毁灭性的后果
But its balance is just bad enough to be devastating.

231
00:13:20,54 --> 00:13:23,05
‎但这并不意味着我们注定要重蹈覆辙
But that doesn't mean we're doomed to repeat history.

232
00:13:23,71 --> 00:13:25,67
‎我们可以终结流行病
We can end pandemics. We've done it before.

233
00:13:26,22 --> 00:13:27,05
‎我们也曾做到过
We can end pandemics. We've done it before.

234
00:13:28,01 --> 00:13:31,14
‎在20世纪 我们发现了抗生素
In the 20th century, we discovered antibiotics.

235
00:13:32,01 --> 00:13:37,52
‎所以黑死病等细菌性疾病的致死率 ‎大大降低了
So the Bubonic Plague and all these other bacterial diseases became far less deadly.

236
00:13:38,73 --> 00:13:43,11
‎但抗生素对这种冠状病毒 ‎或任何病毒都无效
But antibiotics don't work against this coronavirus, or any viruses.

237
00:13:43,98 --> 00:13:47,28
‎我们有针对其中一些疾病的有效药物 ‎比如艾滋病…
We have effective drugs for some of them, like HIV...

238
00:13:48,11 --> 00:13:51,28
‎如今 传染性和致命性都大大降低了
which can now be far less contagious and deadly.

239
00:13:52,20 --> 00:13:55,87
‎但安全的抗病毒药物的研发难度很高
But safe antiviral drugs are really hard to develop.

240
00:13:55,96 --> 00:13:59,79
‎所以战胜病毒的最好方法 ‎就是通过免疫
So the best way to defeat a virus is through immunity.

241
00:14:00,54 --> 00:14:03,25
‎当某些病毒在人群中传播时
When certain viruses spread through a population,

242
00:14:03,34 --> 00:14:05,05
‎一些感染者死亡…
some infected people die...

243
00:14:05,84 --> 00:14:07,22
‎另一些人得以幸存
but others survive.

244
00:14:07,84 --> 00:14:12,10
‎他们的免疫系统 ‎学会了识别病毒并将其击退
Their immune systems have learned to recognize the virus and fight it off.

245
00:14:13,35 --> 00:14:18,06
‎当足够多的人获得免疫时 ‎病毒就更难传播了
When that happens in enough people, it's much harder for the virus to spread.

246
00:14:18,85 --> 00:14:20,98
‎这就是所谓的群体免疫
This is called herd immunity.

247
00:14:22,40 --> 00:14:24,23
‎感染率会放缓
The rate of infection slows.

248
00:14:24,98 --> 00:14:26,61
‎然后病毒就会消失了
[Daszak] And the virus dies out.

249
00:14:27,36 --> 00:14:32,78
‎但对于COVID-19 ‎如果世界只是等待群体免疫的到来
[narrator] But with COVID-19,

254
00:14:29,15 --> 00:14:32,87
if the world just waited to achieve herd immunity naturally,

250
00:14:33,53 --> 00:14:34,95
‎那会导致数百万人死亡
millions would die,

251
00:14:35,66 --> 00:14:39,12
‎而且其他冠状病毒 ‎甚至不会产生终身免疫
and other coronaviruses don't even give lifelong immunity.

252
00:14:39,21 --> 00:14:41,88
‎对于新型冠状病毒 我们还不了解
For this one, we just don't know yet.

253
00:14:44,38 --> 00:14:48,55
‎这使得研制疫苗变得更加重要
Which makes it even more crucial that we create a vaccine.

254
00:14:49,72 --> 00:14:51,39
‎如果有足够多的人接种疫苗
If enough people get vaccinated,

255
00:14:51,47 --> 00:14:55,51
‎就能够安全快捷地获得群体免疫
it's a safe and life-saving shortcut to herd immunity.

256
00:14:56,18 --> 00:14:59,06
‎第一例疫苗是用来对付天花的
The first vaccine was created to fight smallpox.

257
00:14:59,85 --> 00:15:04,57
‎1980年 ‎在大规模的全球疫苗接种运动之后
And in 1980, after a massive global vaccination campaign,

258
00:15:04,65 --> 00:15:10,74
‎天花成为世界上 ‎第一个被宣布根除的病毒
smallpox was the first virus ever declared eradicated from the world.

259
00:15:10,82 --> 00:15:14,58
‎这些疾病造成的死亡人数 ‎也明显低于过去了
And these diseases don't cause nearly the amount of deaths they used to.

260
00:15:15,16 --> 00:15:18,58
‎但是疫苗也是很难研发的
But vaccines are also really hard to develop.

261
00:15:18,83 --> 00:15:23,25
‎要用一年到一年半的时间 ‎才能知道它是否有效
It's gonna take a year to a year and a half to really know if it works.

262
00:15:23,33 --> 00:15:27,92
‎在此期间 ‎病毒还在继续传播和致死
[narrator] And while we wait, the virus keeps spreading and killing.

263
00:15:28,46 --> 00:15:30,84
‎所以我们能做的 就是减缓病毒传播
So the best we can do is slow it down,

269
00:15:30,93 --> 00:15:33,76
using a method that's a lot more old school.

264
00:15:31,55 --> 00:15:33,76
‎使用一种更加老式的方法
using a method that's a lot more old school.

265
00:15:34,35 --> 00:15:36,68
‎其实这种方法是在七个世纪前发明的
In fact, it was invented seven centuries ago

266
00:15:36,76 --> 00:15:38,39
‎以应对黑死病
during the Black Death:

267
00:15:38,47 --> 00:15:39,35
‎那就是隔离
quarantine.

268
00:15:40,52 --> 00:15:43,69
‎或者稍微温和一些的方法 ‎“保持社交距离”
Or its gentler cousin, "social distancing":

269
00:15:43,90 --> 00:15:47,02
‎避免聚集以及跟他人亲密接触
avoiding crowds and close contact with other people

274
00:15:44,10 --> 00:15:47,02
avoiding crowds and close contact with other people

270
00:15:47,11 --> 00:15:49,57
‎让病毒传播的机会更少
so the virus has fewer chances to spread.

271
00:15:50,44 --> 00:15:53,49
‎1918年流感期间 美国的一个城市
During the 1918 flu, one American city,

00:15:53,57 --> 00:15:55,78
‎圣路易斯 很快采取了这种做法
St. Louis, took that approach quickly,

273
00:15:55,87 --> 00:15:58,12
‎关闭了学校和公共场所
shutting its schools and public places,

274
00:15:58,74 --> 00:16:00,87
‎而费城没有马上这样做
while Philadelphia didn't right away,

280
00:16:00,96 --> 00:16:03,37
and allowed a big parade to go ahead.

275
00:16:01,08 --> 00:16:03,25
‎依旧允许举行大型游行
and allowed a big parade to go ahead.

276
00:16:04,88 --> 00:16:07,17
‎这是圣路易斯的死亡率
This was the death rate in St. Louis.

277
00:16:08,34 --> 00:16:10,17
‎这是费城的死亡率
And this was Philadelphia's.

278
00:16:11,55 --> 00:16:13,51
‎圣路易斯做到了使疫情曲线平缓
St. Louis flattened their curve,

279
00:16:13,59 --> 00:16:17,10
‎这意味着 ‎疾病会在较长一段时间内造成死亡
which means the disease killed people for a longer period,

280
00:16:17,18 --> 00:16:18,39
‎但死亡人数更少
but fewer died.

281
00:16:20,85 --> 00:16:23,52
‎因为正如意大利在三月份意识到的
Because, as Italy learned in March,

282
00:16:23,60 --> 00:16:26,44
‎如果太多人同时感染
it's much harder for hospitals to save lives

283
00:16:26,52 --> 00:16:28,94
‎医院的救治难度就很大
if too many people get infected at once.

289
00:16:30,94 --> 00:16:34,03
[in Italian] I’m living in the hospital, literally.

284
00:16:31,07 --> 00:16:33,07
‎我已经住在医院里了

285
00:16:33,15 --> 00:16:34,41
‎（法比奥阿里戈尼医生）

287
00:16:38,53 --> 00:16:42,29

288
00:16:43,12 --> 00:16:44,79
‎是我这辈子都没见过的
I've never seen this much of it in my life.

289
00:16:44,87 --> 00:16:46,63
‎人们情况很危重
[in English] People are critical.

293
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:46,63
[in English] People are critical.

290
00:16:46,71 --> 00:16:50,71
‎到这种程度时 ‎你会发现自己的无力感
When you arrive at this point, you realize that you are not enough.

291
00:16:52,01 --> 00:16:54,01
‎我们显然想避免这种情况
[narrator] We obviously want to avoid that,

292
00:16:54,34 --> 00:16:57,76
‎所以许多世界领导人 ‎都发出了同样的呼吁
which is why many world leaders have made the same plea.

293
00:16:58,22 --> 00:16:59,26
‎回家
Go home and stay home.

294
00:16:59,85 --> 00:17:01,52
‎呆在家里
Go home and stay home.

295
00:17:01,60 --> 00:17:03,35
‎大家必须呆在家里
You must stay at home.

296

‎（印度总理 2020年3月22日）
[in Hindi] During this time,

297
00:17:04,98 --> 00:17:09,77
‎在这段时间里 ‎任何印度公民都不应走出家门
no Indian citizen should step out of their home.

300
00:17:05,77 --> 00:17:09,77
no Indian citizen should step out of their home.

‎全世界数以亿计的人一直在等待…
[narrator in English] Hundreds of millions of people around the world

302

‎寻找应对之策
finding ways to cope.

[music playing on speakers]

300
00:17:21,91 --> 00:17:27,75
‎所以这些国家必须进行严格的封锁
So countries really have to go on a hardcore national lockdown

301
00:17:27,83 --> 00:17:30,00
‎才能真正放缓疫情曲线
to really suppress that curve,

308
00:17:29,96 --> 00:17:31,71
and then we have to, at some point,

302
00:17:30,09 --> 00:17:31,63
‎然后 在某个时刻
and then we have to, at some point,

303
00:17:31,71 --> 00:17:34,42
‎我们必须慢慢地、小心地解除封锁
gradually and carefully come out of that lockdown.

‎四月初
[narrator] South Korea is one model. As of early April,

306
00:17:40,76 --> 00:17:43,72
‎他们在没有封锁的情况下 ‎成功控制住了疫情
they've managed to rein in their outbreak without a lockdown

307
00:17:44,18 --> 00:17:48,98
‎他们通过广泛检测和追踪 ‎检测阳性的人群

308
00:17:49,73 --> 00:17:51,69
‎其他地方如果想要做到这样
For other places to pull off something similar,

309
00:17:51,77 --> 00:17:53,82
‎他们就需要加大检测力度
they'd need to ramp up their testing.

310
00:17:54,03 --> 00:17:57,78
‎在疫情曲线的什么位置 ‎你会回去复工？
At what point on the other side of the curve do you go back to work?

311
00:17:57,86 --> 00:18:01,53
‎没有答案 我觉得答案就是加强检测
There is no answer. I think the answer's gonna be in testing.

312
00:18:01,62 --> 00:18:05,00
‎如果今天可以检测数百万人
If you could test, today, millions of people,

313
00:18:05,08 --> 00:18:07,41
‎那明天就可以让他们复工 对吧？
you could send them to work tomorrow, right?

314
00:18:07,50 --> 00:18:09,58
‎问题是如果我们不够小心
The problem is if we're not careful,

315
00:18:09,92 --> 00:18:12,63
‎这种被抑制的爆发 ‎可能会持续很长一段时间

‎否则选择十分有限
you have limited options,

323

‎我们可以对流感或SARS这样的流行病 ‎做好更充分的准备
[Gates] We could be far more ready for a pandemic like a flu or a SARS.
