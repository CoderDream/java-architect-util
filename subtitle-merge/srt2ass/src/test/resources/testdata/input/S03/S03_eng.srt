Your job is to impress us with
one chocolate-intensive dessert.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,200
Lots of chocolate!

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,867
You must incorporate one
of these spices

5
00:00:12,867 --> 00:00:15,367
into your chocolate dessert.

6
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:17,733
DUFF: This is an incredibly
sophisticated dessert

7
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:20,100
for an adult,
and you're 10 years old.

Sweet moola!

Don't you get

Okay.

Yes, yes, yes!

29
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,967
I make them, like,
every weekend.

30
00:01:16,967 --> 00:01:19,833
Three dozen macaroons.

Oh, God.

36 macaroons is a lot to take on
for 2 hours.

34
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,833
DUFF: It's an art to make
the perfect French macaroon.

35
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:31,133
It's got to be crunchy
and smooth on the outside

36
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,433
and tender and moist
on the inside.

37
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:35,633
They all need to be
the same size,

38
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:38,400
and they should have
what we call feet,

39
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,567
which is a little crispy edge
right around the bottom.

mean, because they're like,

I won't turn out like this.

I start on my macaroon batter

49
00:02:10,233 --> 00:02:14,133
because it has to dry
for a while.

50
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:16,800
I am making
a classic almond macaroon

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,567
with a salted-caramel filling.

52
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,300
I went
to a fancy macaroon store,

53
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,067
and they had
a salted-caramel macaroon,

54
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:26,733
and it was really, really good,
so I'm gonna recreate it.

55
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:30,300
I'm combined almond meal,
powdered sugar

56
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,733
in a food processor,

57
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,467
and then I start whipping
my egg whites.

58
00:02:34,467 --> 00:02:37,267
I feel like it's gonna
take so much time

59
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,900
to separate my eggs,

60
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,167
so I just used liquid whites.

a raspberry white-chocolate
surprise macaroon

and raspberries.

my egg whites

and cream of tartar
until it's foamy,

67
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,933
and then I gradually add
some sugar.

68
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:12,533
Sugar makes it, like, shine,

69
00:03:12,533 --> 00:03:16,567
and shiny is always
a good thing.

70
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:18,600

to make French macaroons,

71
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,933

at making them.

a chocolate-hazelnut,
mascarpone, nutmeg filling,

have the cocoa powder?

are you doing?

Red-velvet.
Oh, that sounds good.

96
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,800
I think it'll be
really flavorful,

97
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,933
but at the same time,
I can do it quick,

98
00:04:31,933 --> 00:04:34,133
and I don't have
to stress about it.

00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:36,167
After the dry ingredients
are blended,

in a sifter

101

00:05:14,867 --> 00:05:20,667
Last week, I didn't do the best
with my s'mores brownie.

They just look like they kind of
got run over by a car.

117
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,067
But this week,
I'm proving to the judges

118
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:30,167
that I can create
good s'mores flavor.

I'm also going to make
chocolate-cherry macaroons

00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,067
because I love cherries.

123
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:43,367
I'm going to use
liquid flavoring

124
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:44,667
in my macaroon shells.

125
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,567
Sometimes it
affects the texture,

126
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,400
but I'm willing
to take that risk

127
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,967
because these macaroons
needs to be perfect.

128
00:05:51,967 --> 00:05:53,533
Let's check.

129
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:56,867
To ensure that my macaroon
meringue is stiff enough,

130
00:05:56,867 --> 00:05:58,400
I hold it over my head.

131
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,933
Is it gonna fall?
No, it's not!

132
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:02,267
Oh, is that a test?

133
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,667
Yeah, I hope
that falls out.

a little bit.

135
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,733

00:06:06,733 --> 00:06:07,867
Oh, yeah!

Luckily,
it's never fallen on me,

00:06:09,933 --> 00:06:14,100
but one day I'm gonna look
like the abominable snowman.

139
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,167
Then I fold in
my dry ingredients.

140
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,567
I can't under mix,

141
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:19,667
or else my macaroons
are gonna be cracked,

142
00:06:19,667 --> 00:06:20,867
but if I over mix,

143
00:06:20,867 --> 00:06:24,167
my macaroons are gonna be flat.

144
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:27,067
Food Network stars wish
they were this good.

145
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,900
I'm making
two different macaroons

146
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,367
because it's already hard enough
making one flavor in two hours,

147
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:42,433
so I hope I get extra credit
for making two flavors.

148
00:06:42,433 --> 00:06:44,300
Once my batter
has come together,

149
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:46,433
I separate it into two bowls.

150
00:06:46,433 --> 00:06:49,933
One bowl is going to be
for the creamsicle macaroons,

151
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:55,133
which is gonna get orange zest
and orange food coloring.

152
00:06:55,133 --> 00:06:57,367
The other bowl
is for red-velvet,

153
00:06:57,367 --> 00:07:01,833
which is gonna get cocoa powder
and red food dye.

154

00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:05,567
I'm thinking
of spring time.

157
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:08,633
Everybody loves an ice cream
or something,

158
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:09,767
and the first thing

159
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:12,067
that popped to my mind
was creamsicle.

160
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,667
Mmm!
[ Gasps ]
That's fun!

161
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:15,467
I love creamsicle.
I like that idea.

162
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,933
The other is going to be
red-velvet.

00:07:17,933 --> 00:07:19,433
Well, we'll let you
get to it.

164
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:20,367
Okay.

165
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:28,500
Today, I'm making
chocolate macaroons

166
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,467
with a cream-cheese rim
and raspberry coulis.

167
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:34,867
My inspiration behind this is
I love raspberry coulis.

168
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:38,200
It's so tart,
and it's got, like, this pop.

169
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,833
Coulis is basically
reduced berries.

170
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,800
And while the raspberries

171
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,967
and sugar are cooking down,

172
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:48,067
I'm starting
to pipe my macaroons.

173
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,600
My first couple
macaroons look bad.

174
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:54,067
They're a little out of form,
and they're a little too big.

175
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,433
I am going to keep going

176
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,167
and hope that
it fixes in the oven.

177
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm a little worried
that Emma hasn't fully mixed

178
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,767
her macaroon batter.

179
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,067
I can still see chunks
of cocoa powder,

180
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,433
chunks of powdered sugar.

181
00:08:04,433 --> 00:08:06,567
That should be
all one color.

182
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,833
Ooh, stay down.

183
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:17,667
I'm piping, and my macaroons
have, like, little peaks.

184
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,733
You don't want
those on macaroons,

185
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,533
so I try to get them down
with my hand,

186
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,700
but that's like ruining
the texture of the macaroon.

187
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,067
Hopefully,
when they bake they go down,

188
00:08:28,067 --> 00:08:29,533
because if they don't,

189
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,767
they won't be
the perfect macaroon!

190
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:35,867
How is everyone doing?

191
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:36,967
Good.

192
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,900
Good.

193
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,067
Watch Yahshimabet pipe.

194
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:41,400
She's got
a really nice touch.

195
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,067
Right? So you pipe,
and then flick.

196
00:08:43,067 --> 00:08:44,500
Pipe, and then flick.

197
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,167
I have a feeling she's made
a macaroon or two.

198
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,733
Or 1,000.
[ Laughs ]

Little lick of the wrist.
That's my thing.

One hour left, bakers!

201
00:09:00,367 --> 00:09:02,833
To get all the air bubbles out,
you get your pan,

202
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,267
and you whack it.

203
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,067
MATTHEW:
Dry for 30 minutes.

204
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:10,500
You don't need that long
in the oven.

205
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,400
It's before they go in the oven.
They have to dry out.

206
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,367
The reason why need to be dry
is because the liquid

207
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,833
and the air
that you've whipped into it,

208
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,167
that's what makes them go
[imitates pop] and pop up.

209
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,167
Trying to feel the air.

210
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:22,433
One way to make sure

211
00:09:22,433 --> 00:09:24,600
that your macaroons
are dry enough

212
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,100
is you put them an
under an air duct.

213
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,067
So I'm just trying to find one.

214
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,800
I'm not doing a crazy dance.

215
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,133
I think that's good.

216
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:42,500
My egg whites aren't really
getting whipped and stiff.

217
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,067
My egg whites aren't whipping.

218
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:47,900
I see other people have already
piped out their macaroons,

219
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:52,200
and I'm still on my batter,
which is scary.

220
00:09:58,967 --> 00:10:00,733
One hour left, bakers!

221
00:10:00,733 --> 00:10:04,333
One hour to mesmerize us
with macaroons!

222
00:10:07,067 --> 00:10:12,967
My egg whites aren't really
getting whipped and stiff.

223
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:16,067
My egg whites, they're just
getting foamy on the top,

224
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:20,300
and they're not whipping at all.

225
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,367
Peggy really looks frazzled.
I'm worried about her.

226
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,300
Peggy used
liquid egg whites

227
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,533
instead of
separating eggs,

228
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:26,967
and they're
not whipping up.

229
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:28,400
I've found,
in my career,

230
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,100
liquid egg whites work
about 80% of the time.

231
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,567
Sometimes, they just
don't whip up.

232
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,867
It's a real thing.

233
00:10:34,867 --> 00:10:37,067
All right,
I got to go talk to her.
All right.

234
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,100
Oh, hi, Duff.
Those aren't whipping up.

235
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,567
I know.

236
00:10:43,567 --> 00:10:46,467
If they don't whip up,
you should redo that.

237
00:10:46,467 --> 00:10:50,000
Okay, I'm not. I'm not. I'm just
gonna restart. It's fine.

238
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,267
Instead of using
the liquid whites,

239
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:55,533
'cause I think that's
what's causing the problem,

240
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,967
I switch
to regular egg whites.

241
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:01,833
I'm regretting using
the liquid egg whites a lot.

242
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,300
It takes way less time
than I thought it would.

243
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,467
So, I get those in the mixer
and I start whipping them,

244
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:11,567
and ka-bam, they're the way
I wanted them to be.

245
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:13,167
It looks good.

246
00:11:13,167 --> 00:11:16,400
I feel like I just
wasted like five minutes,

247
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,467
and that counts so much
while you're making macaroons.

248
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:22,100
Really?

249
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,433

YAHSHIMABET: Yes!

252
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,667
I take my finger, I touch it,
and it doesn't stick,

253
00:11:33,667 --> 00:11:36,300
so I then put them
into the oven.

254
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,567
Now, I'm going
to start on my fillings.

255
00:11:38,567 --> 00:11:42,100
First, I'm making my
chocolate-hazelnut mascarpone.

256
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,367
I beat my mascarpone,

257
00:11:44,367 --> 00:11:47,633
and I add my powdered sugar
and the heavy whipping cream.

258
00:11:47,633 --> 00:11:50,800
Then I add spoonfuls
of chocolate-hazelnut spread,

259
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
and I get nutmeg
because I think the flavors

260
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,767
will go good with the chocolate.

261
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,800
Ooh! Yum!
This looks good.

Hey! Your macaroons are
in the oven already, huh?

263

Yes, they are.

00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,767
So, you've already done
your fillings?

265
00:12:02,767 --> 00:12:04,633

to start on my other one.

a cream-cheese,
like, marshmallow fluff,

with a little bit
of strawberry in there

289

For my filling, I am adding
cream cheese and butter,

and I'm going
to cream that together,

294
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,600
and once that's creamy,
I'll add marshmallow cream.

295
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,700
The marshmallow cream
is for fluff,

296
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,400
and so it just kind of gives it,
like, an extra fluffiness.

297
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:13,333
Once that's creamy,
I'll add powdered sugar.

298
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,767
Once that's mixed together,
I'll add vanilla

299
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:22,367

That's not enough to make

with something fast,

323
00:14:19,167 --> 00:14:22,500
or else it's not going to taste
like marshmallow butter cream.

324
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,533
It's just going to be
vanilla butter cream.

I am literally making up
this recipe right now.

I'm going to add cream cheese.

327
00:14:29,333 --> 00:14:31,233
I come up
with using cream cheese,

328
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:34,433
because I like the acidity
of cream cheese,

329
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:36,367
and I think cream cheese
and chocolate,

330
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:40,167
like, just explode
into one awesome deliciousness.

331
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,333

like 18 steps in it,

Oh, my!

346
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:18,667
That went great.

347
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,367
...and I whip that together
until it's light and fluffy.

348
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,867
And then I add in my cream...

349
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,533
A little bit more cream.

350
00:15:27,533 --> 00:15:31,067
...and then a few tablespoons
of the white chocolate.

351
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,700
Perfect.

352
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:38,133
I would, like, eat this stuff
by the spoonful.

353
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,467
Yummy!

354
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:44,167
They're not dried yet.

355
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:47,800
My macaroon shells
are not completely dry,

356
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,433
but I don't have much time,

357
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:52,067
so I have to put them
in the oven no matter what.

358
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,633
And my caramel is really
soupy and runny and thin.

359
00:15:58,633 --> 00:16:01,200
I don't think it's going
to set up in time.

360
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,133
I want to have a back-up plan,

361
00:16:03,133 --> 00:16:05,333
so I decide to make
a chocolate ganache

362
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:09,467
because I know
you can fill macaroons

363
00:16:09,467 --> 00:16:12,700
with ganache,
and it tastes really good.

364
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,667
To make my ganache, I put
heavy cream in a sauce pan,

365
00:16:16,667 --> 00:16:18,367
and then I let that come
to a simmer.

366
00:16:18,367 --> 00:16:20,733
I pour it onto my chocolate,

367
00:16:20,733 --> 00:16:22,733
and then I whisk it
until it's smooth.

00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:30,700
I'm making
American butter cream.

369
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:35,533
It's just heavy whipping cream,
vanilla, and butter and sugar.

370
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:40,200
So, it'll be sweet and thick
like an ice cream.

371
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,733
Isn't that
a lot of sugar

that he's putting
into his American butter cream?

373
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,733
I would not use that much
if I was making

That's gonna get nice
and gelled.

This is the stuff
that's delicious.

I hope so,
because if that doesn't gel,

so difficult to stack

is that they're slightly round,

You were definitely much more
successful with the red-velvet.

really good.

697
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:43,033
So, I made
a chocolate macaroon

698
00:30:43,033 --> 00:30:45,667
with cream-cheese icing

699
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,833

in the middle.

any feet.

There's something going on
with the structure here.

I don't know
if it just dried weird.

if it cooled weird.

Was the batter too wet?

Batter might have
been too wet.

The star of your dish
is the coulis.

That is
perfectly balanced.

Totally. Delicious.

it's probably not a macaroon.

Matthew, with
your chocolate-cherry macaroon,

little bumps on top.

Other than that,
the shape is awesome.

a really light touch

00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,933
And then Yahshimabet's --
so pretty.

871
00:37:08,933 --> 00:37:12,967
With the sparkle on top,
it was very subtle and sheeny.

872
00:37:12,967 --> 00:37:15,067
But they weren't
macaroon-y enough.

873
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,100
It tasted a like
a little brownie.

874
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,633
Yeah, but it wasn't
unenjoyable.

Matthew --
A tornado hits his station

879
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,300
and amazing macaroons
flew out of it.

880
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:33,467
I love the way that he put
together that s'mores macaroon,

881
00:37:33,467 --> 00:37:35,133
and I love the fact
that it wasn't just marshmallow,

882
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,233
it was marshmallow
and cream cheese.

883
00:37:36,233 --> 00:37:37,633
What I really loved

884
00:37:37,633 --> 00:37:40,300
about Matthew's
cherry-chocolate macaroons

885
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,233
was that little surprise
of actual cherry inside.

886
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:45,700
Yeah.
The filling was very sweet.

887
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,300
But I liked it.

888
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,067
Who do you
think struggled today?

889
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,633
Peggy.
Peggy.

890
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:53,133
It really wasn't
a classic macaroon

891
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,600
because when they came
off the paper,

892
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,233
the cookie stayed
on the paper.

893
00:37:56,233 --> 00:37:57,967
All she had left
was a shell,

894
00:37:57,967 --> 00:37:59,333
and so she filled it
with that ganache.

895
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,467
So, when you look at it,
it looked like, "Oh, wow!

896
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:02,867
These are, like,
professional,"

897
00:38:02,867 --> 00:38:04,267
and then you open it up
and like, "Oh, no.

898
00:38:04,267 --> 00:38:07,267
It's just a crust
and it's full of ganache.

900
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,500
Yeah, but the good thing,
the ganache tasted good.

901
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,700
That was delicious,
and it would have been great

902
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,133
if the ratio was right.

903
00:38:14,133 --> 00:38:15,867
You know who else really
struggled today?

904
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,067
Emma?
Yeah.

905
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,700
Those did not
look like macaroons.

906
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,933
But they were delicious.
[ Laughing ] Yeah.

907
00:38:21,933 --> 00:38:23,700
Oh, my God. That coulis?

908
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,267
Oh, I want her to come out
to my house and make coulis.

909
00:38:26,267 --> 00:38:28,733
Perfect ratio of sweetness
to tartness. Perfect!

910
00:38:28,733 --> 00:38:33,133
So, we got Peggy's ganache bomb,
and we got Emma's...

911
00:38:33,133 --> 00:38:34,900
It's a...
BOTH: ..."macaroon."

912
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,233
Here's the tough part.

913
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:38,500
Ohhhh!
La, la, la, la, la, la!

914
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,100
Yep, I know.

915
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,200
We got to
let one of them go.

I know.
I don't want to, either.

918

I'm pretty worried,

919
00:38:48,733 --> 00:38:52,367
but that coulis
might have saved me.

920
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:55,667
Bakers, we asked you
to make three-dozen macaroons,

921
00:38:55,667 --> 00:38:58,767
and as you well now know,
it's not an easy task.

922
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,833
But three of you
did make macaroons

923
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,567
that really stacked up.

924
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:07,967

That's right.

I hope I can win this,

930
00:39:18,433 --> 00:39:22,167
but I know I can't
because it wasn't tall enough.

Jane, your
raspberry macaroons

butter cream

by a professional French baker.

your chocolate-espresso
macaroons -- really elegant.

938

And your chocolate-espresso
ganache had

939
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,167
a really great,
balanced coffee flavor.

Matthew, you did
two different macaroon batters,

943
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:51,767
and they were both
delicious.

944
00:39:51,767 --> 00:39:54,933
Your s'mores macaroon had
a nice cream-cheese filling,

945
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:56,533
and we loved
the pretty decorations

946

and the cherry surprise
in your cherry macaroon.

I really think my macaroons
deserve to win.

948

But one of you created macaroons
that were simply the best.

00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:30,933
The target
is not my head.

62
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,533
Okay?

63
00:02:32,533 --> 00:02:34,433
Justice.

64
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,900
Aidan.
Okay.

65
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,400
Awe.

66
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,367
Cole.

67
00:02:41,967 --> 00:02:43,733
Audra.

68
00:02:44,633 --> 00:02:46,833
Brooke.

69
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,067
Well done.

70
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:49,767
Charlotte.

71
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:51,100
Oh, God.

72
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,567
Dylin, go for it.

73
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:56,067
Whoa, what an arm!

74
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,900
Keili.
Let me have it.

75
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,567
Nope.

76
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,367
Reese.

77
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:02,667
Whoa.

78
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,567
Okay. Maya.

79
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:05,933
Aw!

80
00:03:05,933 --> 00:03:07,067
Yeah!

81
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,133
So that means Jason won.

82
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,200
Good job, Jason.

83
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,433
You won an advantage.

84
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,567
But we'll tell you
about that later.

85
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:18,367
All right, guys. It is time
for your first big bake.

86
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:23,767
You have 2 hours
to make one dozen cupcakes.

87
00:03:23,767 --> 00:03:24,733
[ Gasps ] Ooh.

88
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:26,067
Yeah.

89
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:27,300
And because
this is a carnival,

90
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,333
you need to decorate
your cupcakes

91
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,867
in a colorful,
eye-catching way.

92
00:03:31,867 --> 00:03:34,900
Carnival? What am I supposed
to incorporate into it?

93
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,233
Hot dogs?

94
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:39,433
Remember,
this is a competition.

95
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:43,400
They'll be one baker each week
who wins the challenge

96
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,200
and then one baker
who misses the mark

97
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,767
and has to leave.

98
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:48,333
All right, guys.

99
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:52,400
Two hours to make one dozen
carnival cupcakes.

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,600
And your baking time
starts...

101
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,433
now!
Now!

102
00:03:59,667 --> 00:04:01,633
AUDRA: Lemons.

103
00:04:01,633 --> 00:04:04,833
We have to make two dozen
cupcakes in 2 hours

104
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:07,700
and decorate them so they
stand out from all the others.

105
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:09,467
Red, blue.

106
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:13,167
I'm making a vanilla
tie-dyed cupcake.

107
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:16,267
I cream my butter
and sugar first

108
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:19,433
because it makes
the cupcakes fluffy.

109
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:23,100
I combine flour,
salt, and baking powder

110
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,133
and add that to
my wet ingredients.

111
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:28,367
Carnival cupcake version
of tie-dyed.

112
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:30,300
I want a nice, deep red.

113
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,100
Oh, that looks nice.

114
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,967
I also want dark blue and white
when they cut open the cupcake.

115
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,500
My name is Jason.

116
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,633
And I live
in Seattle, Washington.

117
00:04:40,633 --> 00:04:42,267
I love science.

118
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:45,167
And I think baking
is like science.

119
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:48,500
But you get to eat
your experiments.

120
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,900
Delicious.

121
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,300
Ooh, cupcakes.

122
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,433
Blue!

123
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,900
You don't want
to blend the colors

124
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,067
because it'll just
be like a brown.

125
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,400
You kind of layer it.

126
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Perfect.

127
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,133
Red, white, and blue, okay.

128
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,600
Lemons. I need lemons.
I love lemon.

129
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,800
I've never made
a carnival dessert.

130
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,833
But cupcakes are my specialty.
So I'm not worried at all.

131
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,767
I am making lemon cupcakes

132
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:19,067
and raspberry frosting.

133
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,633
My name is Audra Tow.
I'm 10 years old.

134
00:05:22,633 --> 00:05:25,933
And I live
in Aurora, Colorado.

135
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,567
I love my cat.

136
00:05:27,567 --> 00:05:30,067
I'm actually really good
at imitating her meow.

137
00:05:30,067 --> 00:05:31,733
Meow.

138
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:34,600
I get my baking inspiration
from my Nana.

139
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,167
She taught me to bake
when I was 5.

140
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:38,500
And then my love for baking

141
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,533
just began to, like,
grow and grow.

142
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:43,767
I can't wait to show the world
what I can do.

143
00:05:43,767 --> 00:05:45,400
To make my cupcakes,

144
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,600
I add a little bit
of lemon flavor.

145
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,867
That's gonna...

146
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,400
Going fast.

147
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,300
I fill the cupcake liners
as fast as I can.

148
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,567
I hope these cupcakes
aren't too small.

149
00:05:56,567 --> 00:06:00,467
I'm not sure if I added enough
cake batter to each cupcake.

150
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:02,500
Okay, I have to put
these in the oven.

151
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,067
I think I'll be fine
after they're baked.

152
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,233
Perfect.

153
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,633
Maple bacon cupcakes.

154
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:11,300
My name is Aidan.
I'm 12 years old.

155
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,667
And I'm from the really
small town next to a city,

156
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:17,067
next to a bigger city,
all by the beach.

157
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:19,167
Watching the
"Kids Baking Championship"

158
00:06:19,167 --> 00:06:22,567
inspired me to become
a very serious baker.

159
00:06:22,567 --> 00:06:24,067
And now I'm here.

160
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:26,167
It's pretty amazing.

161
00:06:26,167 --> 00:06:28,467
I'm gonna put maple
in the cupcake

162
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:32,167
and a big piece of bacon
right on it.

163
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:34,433
I've only cooked bacon
once before.

164
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:37,233
I don't even 100%
remember how to.

165
00:06:37,233 --> 00:06:41,167
That's gonna go in there
until it's all crispy.

166
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,333
All right.

167
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,433
Whoo, that's strong.

168
00:06:46,633 --> 00:06:48,667
I'm gonna check my bacon.

169
00:06:48,667 --> 00:06:51,933
Is that bacon?

170
00:06:51,933 --> 00:06:53,467
Looks pretty cooked.

171
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:56,067
If you have any extra,
I'd like to eat some.

172
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,967
Bacon's got my name
on it, Audra.

173
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:01,333
You get all the bacon.
I get it.

174
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,067
Thirty minutes gone.
90 minutes left, bakers.

175
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,633
Hey, Maya,
can I borrow the blue?

176
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:07,667
Oh, yeah, sure.

177
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,067
Thanks.
Yeah.

My name is Keili Gorczyca.

179
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,267
It's a Polish last name.

180
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,233
It means "mustard seed."

181
00:07:16,233 --> 00:07:20,833
I would describe
myself as weird.

182
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,467
Definitely weird.

183
00:07:22,467 --> 00:07:24,267
I can even get
weird with baking.

184
00:07:24,267 --> 00:07:27,067
Like, I'll chop up grasshoppers,
coat 'em in chocolate,

185
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:30,233
and make
a grasshopper chocolate cookie.

186
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:34,067
I'm making a vanilla
tie-dye cupcake.

187
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,167
The purple mixing in
with the blue.

188
00:07:37,167 --> 00:07:40,067
And it's making it turn dark.

189
00:07:40,067 --> 00:07:42,067
But I can't do another batter.

190
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:45,067
I'm gonna put them in the oven.

191
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:48,167
Cupcakes? Piece of cake.

192
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,900
Literally.

193
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,967
There has never
been a boy winner

194
00:07:52,967 --> 00:07:55,067
to win the
Kids Baking Championship.

195
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,167
Probably because
I just got here.

196
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,500
My name is Cole.
I'm 12 years old.

197
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,067
And I'm the best baker
in America.

198
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,533
I'm completely self-taught.

199
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:04,933
I love to eat my food,

200
00:08:04,933 --> 00:08:08,200
and that just kind of
encourages me to make more.

201
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,767
Whenever I go to the carnival,

202
00:08:09,767 --> 00:08:11,967
I always end up
getting a root beer float

203
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,867
or some deep-fried
sandwich cookies.

204
00:08:13,867 --> 00:08:18,733
So I'm making a yellow cake
with root beer buttercream.

205
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:20,600
I'm gonna torch
these marshmallows

206
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,600
and air brush 'em
to the perfect popcorn color.

207
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,633
And I'm gonna make some fresh
deep-fried sandwich cookies

208
00:08:26,633 --> 00:08:30,900
and stuff my cupcake.

209
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,333
Your attention please,
bakers.

210
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,867
Step right up, folks,
step right up.

211
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,533
Uh-oh, here it comes.

212
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,867
We've got carnival treats
for everyone.

213
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:40,933
Oh, no.

214
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:42,567
Pretzels, cotton candy.

215

[ All groan ]

216
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:45,567
Chocolate-covered bananas.

217
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,600
Ew!

218
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,767
Kettle corn.

219
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:49,333
Yep.
Uh-oh.

220
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,133
Caramel apples.
Oh, boy.

221
00:08:51,133 --> 00:08:53,133
Churros.
[ Gasps ] I love churro.

222
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,067
These treats are not
for you to eat.

223
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,367
No.

224
00:08:56,367 --> 00:09:00,067
You need to feature these
in your cupcakes.

225
00:09:00,067 --> 00:09:01,467
No!

226
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:03,933
VALERIE: And, Jason,
because you won the advantage,

227
00:09:03,933 --> 00:09:07,467
you get to hand out all the
treats to the other bakers.

228
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:09,133
Oh, no!

229
00:09:09,133 --> 00:09:12,300
COLE:
I need that kettle corn

230
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,267
because I'm already
making marshmallow popcorn.

231
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:17,133
Churros!
Churros!

232
00:09:17,133 --> 00:09:18,667
Mmm, delicious.

233
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,300
Great.

234
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,733
Caramel apple.
Thank you.

235

Kettle corn for Kaniyah.

236
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:26,833
No!

Oh, thanks.

238
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:31,067
Cotton candy for me.

239
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,667
Ugh, gosh.

240
00:09:32,667 --> 00:09:35,300
Cotton candy doesn't go with
deep-fried sandwich cookies.

241
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,333
Thanks a lot, Jason.

242
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:40,500
I had the best cupcakes.
And you ruined it.

00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,067

One dozen carnival cupcakes
with our carnival treat.

What's it gonna be?
Churros!

Churros!
Oh!

I had chocolate sandwich
cookie stuffed cupcake

with a root beer buttercream.

253
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,433
Cotton candy
doesn't go with that.

254
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:11,200
I'm just gonna put it
on top for decoration.

255
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,800
I hope the judges
still like it the same.

I am the queen of cakes.

262
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,833
I'm making a vanilla cupcake

263
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,833
with vanilla cola buttercream.

264
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:38,567
I am sifting my flour

265
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,967
so I don't have
any little flour chunks

266
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,867
inside of my cupcake.

267
00:10:43,867 --> 00:10:45,900
You all right?

268
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,267
You okay?

269
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:49,033

pretty funny.

[ Laughter ]

271
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:56,667
I whip my egg whites
until they form soft peaks.

272
00:10:56,667 --> 00:10:59,267
Then I fold them
into my cupcake batter.

273
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:01,467
The cupcake batter is smooth

274
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:03,900
and doesn't have
thick clumps in it.

275
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,067
I'm gonna crush the popcorn
into little small pieces.

276
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:09,367
Perfect.

277
00:11:09,367 --> 00:11:11,767
And I scoop it
on top of the cupcake

278
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:13,433
and put 'em in the oven.

279
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,100
Okay. Now I have 'em.

the roller coaster, like,

This one's for you.

00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,367
This actually looks like orange.

292
00:11:43,367 --> 00:11:46,100
I am making a vanilla
tie-dye cupcake

293
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,333
with all the colors
of the rainbow.

294
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,467
I decide to incorporate
the churros

295
00:11:51,467 --> 00:11:55,533
by putting, like, a chunk of it
inside the cupcake.

296
00:11:55,533 --> 00:11:59,267
So maybe if I put that in there,
the judges will taste that.

I make buttercream frosting
a good deal of the time.

extra special.

gonna do with pretzels?

Oh, yeah. I'm gonna
fry my pretzels.

303
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,100
I have never had
a fried pretzel.

304
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,367
But I'm gonna coat them
in sugar.

305
00:12:25,367 --> 00:12:27,167
How bad can it taste?

306
00:12:27,167 --> 00:12:30,067
Cooked these for a bit too long,
but whatever.

307
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,133
Uh-oh. Ugh!

308
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,400
I think that
my cupcakes are messy.

309
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,367
But I'm gonna cover it
in frosting

310
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,200
and then put some pretzels
inside my cupcake

311
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,067
and on top of the frosting.

312
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:44,067
Then I want to add
some more pop.

313
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,767
I find these letters.

314
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,300
I tape them onto
the mini sticks.
And I put 'em in.

What's the flavor
of your cupcakes?

Lemon.

Mine are lemon.

00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,767
Seriously?
I thought of it first.

And I've traveled all over
the world because of it.

I describe my baking as global

00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:12,933
because I'm inspired
by all my travels.

So now I have to switch
my entire plan.

What are you
gonna do with it?
Put it in the buttercream.

333

I'm gonna chop some of mine

334
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:36,700
and put it on top
of the frosting, too.

335
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:41,567
To make my buttercream special,
I add my kettle corn.

336
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:44,667
Kettle corn and lemon
do not go together.

337
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,233
But I made it work.

You'll know when
they taste good, too.

I don't like to
decorate that much.

to make my cupcakes stand out.

00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,433
with shredded bits
of kettle corn,

00:13:58,433 --> 00:14:03,067

and colored chocolate chips.

like an inch a year.

Yeah.
Why does it
get so hot here?

357
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:30,233
During summer,
the high pressure system

358
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,100
blocks away
all of the, like, rain.

JUSTICE: Jason gave me
caramel apple.

00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,900
I think it's cool to have two
ingredients out of one thing

363
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:47,633
because now I can use
the caramel in the buttercream.

364
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,367
And then I cut the apple
into little cubes.

365
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,233
I'm gonna deep-fry them
for the top of my cupcakes.

366
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:55,500
I will do a multicolored
buttercream frosting.

367
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,367
Because when you're
at a carnival,

368
00:14:57,367 --> 00:14:59,600
you normally see,
like, fun colors

369
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,467
and exciting things.

370
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:05,200
I start to frost
the cupcakes.

371
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,467
But then I realize it's melting.

372
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:10,733
I'm putting icing
on a hot cupcake.

373
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,067
This can only mean disaster.

374
00:15:13,067 --> 00:15:15,633
I'm going to throw my cupcakes
into the blast chiller

375
00:15:15,633 --> 00:15:19,333
and just hope and pray
that they'll cool down in time.

376
00:15:21,467 --> 00:15:24,567
I'm making a Swiss meringue
instead of an American.

377
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,433
American buttercream
is just butter and sugar.

378
00:15:27,433 --> 00:15:28,633
Ew.

379
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:32,067
Cook the egg whites
so it's safe to eat.

380
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,600
Try Swiss meringue buttercream,

381
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,633
and you'll never
go back to American.

382
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:40,300
It's lighter. And it has
a much silkier texture.

383
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,733
Bananas don't really go
with bacon maple,

384
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,733
but it'll work.

385
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:48,467
I pipe the frosting
and take a big slice of bacon

386
00:15:48,467 --> 00:15:51,200
and a big chunk
of chocolate-covered banana

387
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,300
and use that to garnish
my cupcakes.

388
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,333

I got the lemons!

anything with citrus.

I love citrus so much.

are finally done, and...

Ah, no!

408
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,800
...I dropped my egg whites.

409
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,100
Oh, God.

410
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,767
There's still a little bit
left in my bowl.

It's all I have now.

412
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,667
But this isn't going to be
enough for the frosting.

Oh, my God.

00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,867
Ugh!

417
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,600
I spilled my egg whites.

418
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,867
It's all I have now.

419
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:22,433
Ugh.

420
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:26,067
I have so much
decorating to do.

421
00:17:26,067 --> 00:17:27,567
And I do not have time

422
00:17:27,567 --> 00:17:29,867
to make another Swiss
meringue buttercream.

423
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:34,400
Now I'm just going to make
a fluffy vanilla frosting.

424
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,133
It's just butter and sugar.

425
00:17:36,133 --> 00:17:39,633
And it's very quick
and very easy.

426
00:17:39,633 --> 00:17:42,133
I still don't have
my filling done.

427
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,400
So honestly, I'm really worried.

428
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,333
I wish they could've tasted
my Swiss meringue buttercream.

429
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:55,400
REESE: My favorite cupcake
is red velvet.

430
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,900
So that's what I'm gonna serve
to Duff and Valerie today.

431
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,933
Reese's cupcakes, he's the only
one doing red velvet.

432
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:03,900
Good thinking, man.
Smart kid.

433
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,500
I'm Reese Smith.

434
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,367
And I am from
Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

435
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:10,067
My mom owns a bakery.

436
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:12,867
And she taught me
everything about baking.

437
00:18:12,867 --> 00:18:15,067
I am also a competitive athlete

438
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:17,067
with a lot of trophies
and ribbons.

439
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,833
So I know I'm a winner.

440
00:18:18,833 --> 00:18:20,767
He gave me churros.

441
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,600
He gave me bananas.

442
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,333
What the heck?
I do not like bananas.

443
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,800
But since I still have
to make my buttercream...

444
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,200
Ew.

445
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,967
...I'm gonna add
my chocolate-covered bananas

446
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,267
to my frosting.

447
00:18:33,267 --> 00:18:35,500
Ooh, it smells banana-y.

448
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,067
That's actually
pretty cool.

449
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,333
Yeah.
And it works.

450
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,233
I think I like this flavor.

451
00:18:41,233 --> 00:18:43,533
I put a gummy fish on 'em

452
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:46,067
because I was at a carnival
about a month ago

453
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:49,133
and actually won a fish.

454
00:18:49,133 --> 00:18:51,067
That looks cool.

455
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:52,733
I'm making an orange cupcake

456
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,400
because it's, like,
bright and fun

457
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,267
and tastes really good.

458
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:58,533
My name is Charlotte d'Arabian.

459
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,067
I have a passion
for fashion designing.

460
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,300
It really helps me
with my baking

461
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:05,133
because it helps me
think creatively.

462
00:19:05,133 --> 00:19:09,300
I scoop a little bit less
into my cupcake tins

463
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,200
so I have a little bit
of wiggle room

464
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,067
for extra frosting.

465
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm making Swiss buttercream
frosting.

466
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,900
To make my cupcakes
look carnival,

467
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,833
I'm adding red food coloring

468
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,467
to make my frosting turn pink.

469
00:19:22,467 --> 00:19:26,200
So a nice, yummy
carnival cupcake.

470
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,967
And I add in churro.

471
00:19:27,967 --> 00:19:30,267
[ Sighs ] God.

472
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:34,133
And it's not structuring
as I hoped it would be.

473
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,067
It's so thin.

474
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,100
Charlotte's piping
her frosting.

475
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,867
And it looks really,
really thin.

476
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:41,133
VALERIE: It's runny.

477
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,067
Oh, my God,
this is so liquidy.

478
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,400
I don't have time
to redo it.

479
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,633
So I'm calling it a glaze.

480
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,767
[ Sighs ]

481
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:51,267
COLE: Not enough root beer.

482
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,333
I want my cupcakes
to stand out.

483
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,833
So I decided I'm gonna
paint streaks of dye

484
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,333
into my piping bag

485
00:19:57,333 --> 00:20:00,833
and then add my frosting
to give that lollipop look.

486
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:04,267
Yes. That's awesome.

487
00:20:04,267 --> 00:20:07,000
It's very hard
to incorporate cotton candy.

488
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,867
So I just decide
to put it on top.

489
00:20:09,867 --> 00:20:13,633
With the deep-fried sandwich
cookies and marshmallow popcorn,

490
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:17,467
I think that the judges
are gonna love the decorations.

491
00:20:21,033 --> 00:20:22,667
I take my cupcakes
out of the oven.

492
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,767
Whipped cream.

493
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:27,267
To finish, I make
my vanilla whipped cream.

494
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,133
I take one cupcake out.

495
00:20:31,133 --> 00:20:35,333
I put a little
whipped cream on it.

496
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,633
Now, the cotton candy
is just gonna melt.

497
00:20:37,633 --> 00:20:40,333
That's not gonna work.

498
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,667
I'm gonna have to figure a way.

499
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,700
This whipped cream
is not working.

500
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:49,000
I'm nervous that my cotton candy
would just melt in it.

501
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,633
Jason chose cotton candy.

502
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:52,433
But it looks like
he's struggling with it.

503
00:20:52,433 --> 00:20:54,333
That might be a little bit
of a challenge.

504
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,933
He thought he was
just gonna get to eat it.

505
00:20:55,933 --> 00:20:57,667
That would've been
my downfall.

506
00:20:57,667 --> 00:21:00,533
The cotton candy
might just disintegrate.

507
00:21:00,533 --> 00:21:02,167
I'm gonna have
to do without.

508
00:21:02,167 --> 00:21:04,733
Just gonna get rid
of the whipped cream

509
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:06,333
and use stars

510
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,933
so that it stays together
and doesn't fall off.

511
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:13,467
This twist, I should've gone
with something else.

512
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:21,067
BROOKE: Frosting is done.
I need to start to decorate.

513
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:24,900
Clowns say "carnival" to me.

514
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,633
Its a crumble filling.

515
00:21:26,633 --> 00:21:29,333
I wanna make sure my cupcake
look like a clown.

516
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,167
The first thing I do
is scoop out the center

517
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,667
so I can fill it
with my sweet pretzel filling.

518
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:36,267
You have to look
amazing, cupcakes.

519
00:21:36,267 --> 00:21:37,733
I take a little bit of frosting

520
00:21:37,733 --> 00:21:39,967
of my little ice cream
scoop of cake.

521
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:41,667
Put it on top of the cupcake.

522
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:46,500
Take blue chocolate candies
as my eyes

523
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,767
and take one of these
starfish candies

524
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:51,067
and use it as a hat.

525
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:53,500
I think I'm gonna finish.

526
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:55,800
Ah, God.

527
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:59,067
Eek.
My cupcakes are really short.

528
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:03,533
So I'm hoping that my frosting
will make up for that.

529
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:04,767
Come on.

530
00:22:04,767 --> 00:22:06,333
I hate green apples.

531
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,300
I am now making
a caramel frosting

532
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,600
topped with apple bits.

533
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,267
I get out my powdered sugar
and measure out 3 cups of it.

534
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,933
Add butter, then I add caramel
from my caramel apples

535
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:25,600
and mix that all up.

536
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,933
Wait a sec.

537
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:29,867
Did I not put one of the cups
of powdered sugar in?

538
00:22:29,867 --> 00:22:32,667
I forgot to add a whole cup
of powdered sugar.

539
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:35,833
Epic fail!

540
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:37,333
[ Sighs ]

541
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,333
Wait.

542
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,733
Now thinking about it,
I can't remember.

543
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,333
I'm going to put that in.

544
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,067
So I just add more.

545
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:54,067
I just need to finish these.

546
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,367
Perfect.

come out of the oven.

548

And they look really good.

549
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,900
And I put them in the blast
chiller so they can cool faster

550
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,567
because I'm running out of time.

551
00:23:03,567 --> 00:23:06,100
I need to hurry
and make my frosting.

552
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:12,067
I'm adding cola because I want
to add some carnival flavor.

553
00:23:12,067 --> 00:23:13,400
My buttercream is mixing.

554
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,167
And it starts to separate.

555
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:19,067
It feels like cake batter.

556
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:25,400
I think the cola
is messing it up.

557
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,867

You know...
lemon and chocolate.

770
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,333
Lemon and chocolate,
they go together.

771
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:30,067
Come on.
They're just fine.
Sure they do.

772
00:32:30,067 --> 00:32:32,667
What was your inspiration
to go with lemon?

773
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,833
Valerie loves lemon.

774
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,767
Of course.
Here we go.

775
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:38,267
There's a little bit
of chocolate in there,

776
00:32:38,267 --> 00:32:41,133
so let's see
how this goes.

777
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,067
Mmm.
Yeah?

778
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:44,067
Mm-hmm.
It's all right?

779
00:32:44,067 --> 00:32:45,300
You know why?

780
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,333
Because the kettle corn.

781
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:51,067
I -- okay, listen. I'm --
I respect your opinion.

782
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:54,167
But I don't think the chocolate
and lemon go good together.

783
00:32:54,167 --> 00:32:55,600
Okay. All right.

784
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,200
I think
it's a really good cupcake.

785
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,300
I think your frosting
is wicked sweet.

786
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,667
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.

787
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:02,067
That wasn't a compliment.

788
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:04,100
[ Laughter ]

789
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,867
But the cupcake itself
is really good.

790
00:33:05,867 --> 00:33:07,767
Great job.
Thank you so much.

791
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:09,467
All right,
thank you so much.
Thank you.

792
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:13,467
Reese, tell us about
the decoration on your cupcake.

793
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:14,667
What's going on here?

794
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:19,867
I use fish like what you can
win at a carnival.

795
00:33:19,867 --> 00:33:21,833
Yeah.
You always take them
home in the baggies.

796
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,400
Right.
That's very clever.

797
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,867
I did that, like,
a month ago, actually.

798
00:33:25,867 --> 00:33:28,067
Is he still alive?
No.

799
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:31,433
Well, this is an homage
to your fish.

800
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:34,233
So what kind of cupcake
did you make?

801
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:38,100
I did a red velvet cupcake
with American buttercream

802
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,100
with bananas
and chocolate in it.

803
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,900
Mmm. Mmm.
That's tasty.

804
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,133
It is tasty.
Thank you.

805
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,933
Are you surprised?

806
00:33:48,933 --> 00:33:50,733
I think so, yeah.

807
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:53,933
Well, I got to tell you,
I love the way the banana

808
00:33:53,933 --> 00:33:55,733
and the chocolate
meld together.

809
00:33:55,733 --> 00:33:57,933
Thank you.
Yeah, you know what
this tastes like?

810
00:33:57,933 --> 00:33:59,200
A banana split.

811
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,133
Yeah!
You know?
Really good.

812
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:02,700
Good job.
Okay. Bye.

813
00:34:04,467 --> 00:34:06,600
Justice, what did you
make for us today?

814
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,933
I made vanilla cupcakes
with caramel buttercream,

815
00:34:09,933 --> 00:34:11,367
with deep-fried apples

816
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:14,333
and a little caramel ball
on top.

817
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:16,467
Your buttercream
separated a little bit.

818
00:34:16,467 --> 00:34:18,067
You know,
it looks like it broke.

819
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,133
But the colors
are really nice, you know.

820
00:34:20,133 --> 00:34:21,800
I think the pink and blue
is really cool-looking.

821
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,600
What was your inspiration
here?

822
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:27,533
My inspiration was just kind of,
like, fun at the fair,

823
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:30,633
and maybe it got a little hot
at the fair, so...

824
00:34:30,633 --> 00:34:33,933
And it was windy.
And things went wild.

825
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:35,300
That's fun.

826
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,567
Whoa.
Really moist.

827
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:41,300
It's saying
"caramel apple" to me.

828
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,600
This is awesome.
Mm-hmm.

829
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,667
Thank you.
It's delicious.

830
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:46,300
Mmm!
Like, seriously,
really good.

831
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,100
Which is great, because
that buttercream is ugly.

832
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,833
Yeah. You pulled it out
with the flavor.

833
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:53,067
Yeah.
Thanks, Justice.

834
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:54,167
Bye.

835
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:57,667
Hello.
Kaniyah,
how's it going?

836
00:34:57,667 --> 00:34:59,067
Hi.

837
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,633
A little eh.

838
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:02,333
You had
a little meltdown.

839
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:03,233
Yes.

840
00:35:03,233 --> 00:35:04,700
But you kept going.

841
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,500
And you didn't
let it phase you.

842
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,067
That is really impressive.
Thank you.

843
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,300
So what kind of cupcake
did you make?

844
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,867
I made a vanilla bean
kettle corn cupcake

845
00:35:15,867 --> 00:35:19,067
with a vanilla bean buttercream
with marshmallows.

846
00:35:20,067 --> 00:35:23,067
That is gorgeous
and fluffy.

847
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:24,367
It looks moist.

848
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:27,667
The ratio of cupcake to frosting
looks perfect.

849
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,133
Yeah.

850
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,800
Mmm.
Oh, my goodness, Kaniyah.

851
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,900
That is a good cupcake.

852
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,733
I think you can probably tone
the sugar down a little bit.

853
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:38,600
Really?
Yeah, I think
it's a little too sweet.

854
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,367
I love it. And the crunch
of the kettle corn

855
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:42,800
is really kind of fun.

856
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,067
You hit it out of the park.

857
00:35:44,067 --> 00:35:45,067
Thank you.

858
00:35:45,067 --> 00:35:46,433
It's good.

859
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,133
[ Laughs ]

860
00:35:50,367 --> 00:35:52,067
Thanks a lot, Kaniyah.
Thank you.

861
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,700
You're welcome.

862
00:35:55,167 --> 00:35:57,233
KEILI: I feel nervous

863
00:35:57,233 --> 00:36:01,100
because, are they gonna
like the decoration?

864
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,367
I don't know what
they're gonna think.

865
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:05,333
What made you do this?

866
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:09,467
Well, I just decided
to personalize the cupcakes.

867
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,533
Keili, flattery
will you get everywhere.

868
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,633
Everywhere.

869
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,967
What did you make
for us today?

870
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,433
A vanilla tie-dye cupcake

871
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,800
with chocolate cookie
buttercream

872
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,067
and sugar-dusted fried
pretzel in the inside

873
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,967
and on top.

874
00:36:27,967 --> 00:36:29,767
I like the pretzel.

875
00:36:29,767 --> 00:36:31,833
But I think you could've
crushed it up a little.

876
00:36:31,833 --> 00:36:33,733
That way, you would get,
like, a bite of pretzel

877
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,167
with every bite.
Okay.

878
00:36:35,167 --> 00:36:37,967
It's a really moist,
delicious cupcake.

879
00:36:37,967 --> 00:36:41,100
It's just
a really odd color.

880
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,833
I know. I think
over-dyed it a bit.

881
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,600
Was it chocolate?
No.

882
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,133
Maybe our eyes are
playing tricks on us

883
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:48,233
because it looks
like it's chocolate.

884
00:36:48,233 --> 00:36:50,567
But it tastes good.

885
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:54,333
You know what?
When purple gets caramelized,

886
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:56,133
it gets really dark
really fast.

887
00:36:56,133 --> 00:36:58,267
So then it looks
like chocolate.
Oh!

888
00:36:58,267 --> 00:36:59,800
All right. Keili,
thank you so much.

889
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,767

See ya.

891
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:05,067
All right, Maya. Why don't you
give us the rundown

892
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:06,367
on your carnival cupcake?

893
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:08,967
What did you make?
I made a vanilla cupcake

894
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:11,467
with a churro piece
in the middle.

895
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:13,633
I dyed each one
the color the rainbow.

896
00:37:13,633 --> 00:37:15,467
And there's vanilla
whipped cream

897
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:18,300
with churro pieces on the top.

898
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,900
I wanna see the inside
of the cupcake.

899
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,233
Look at all
those pretty colors.

900
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:23,067
That's so pretty!

901
00:37:27,767 --> 00:37:29,367
That's tasty.

902
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:32,333
You can kind of taste
that cinammony flavor.
Mm-hmm.

903
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,567
I think maybe you might've

904
00:37:34,567 --> 00:37:36,333
beat the batter
a little too long

905
00:37:36,333 --> 00:37:38,067
because I think your cupcake
got a little tough.

906
00:37:38,067 --> 00:37:39,067
What kind of frosting
is this?

907
00:37:39,067 --> 00:37:40,500
Whipped cream.
Okay.

908
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:43,233
I would've maybe liked something
more frosting-y.

909
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,800
Yeah.
Well, thank you, Maya.

910
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,700
Thank you.
Thanks, Maya.

911
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,733
Okay, Jason, what did
you make for us today?

912
00:37:50,733 --> 00:37:52,833
I made a tie-dyed cupcake

913
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,200
with the traditional colors
of the fair.

914
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:59,100
And I had cotton candy
as the twist.

915
00:38:00,567 --> 00:38:02,733
I like your cupcakes.
They look like little aliens.

916
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,867
Take me to your leader.

917
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,333
They're really cute.

918
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:10,433
But, you know, there's one thing
I think you're missing.

919
00:38:10,433 --> 00:38:12,833
I think I'm missing
the same thing.

920
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,900
Frosting.
I know.

921
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,133
I wanted to put frosting
on there.

922
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:21,367
But the frosting
makes cotton candy melt.

923
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,533
But cupcakes are all
about frosting.

924
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:25,333
I know.

925
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,633
Yeah,
I completely agree.

926
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,100
You need frosting.

927
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,667
You need frosting!

928
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:32,067
Are you trying
to use the force?

[ Laughs ]

930
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,333
I think I did pretty good
with the tie-dye part.

931
00:38:37,333 --> 00:38:40,100
Oh, look at that.
It is red, white, and blue.

932
00:38:41,367 --> 00:38:44,433
Mmm.
That's a really good cupcake.

933
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:47,867
But as moist as it is,
it tastes a little dry

934
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,967
because you don't have
the frosting to play with it.

935
00:38:49,967 --> 00:38:51,067
Yeah.
Jason,
thanks so much.

936
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,067

00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:54,433

want to go home

Bakers, most of you created
some incredible cupcakes.

945
00:39:17,933 --> 00:39:20,600
But three of you
in particular

946
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,567
delivered the excitement
and flavors of a carnival.

947
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:28,833
Reese, you chose to do
red velvet cupcakes

948
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:32,800
that went so well
with chocolate-covered bananas.

949
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,667
Justice, you made an awesome,
moist vanilla cupcake.

950

"caramel apple."

Kaniyah, your vanilla
kettle corn cupcakes

952
00:39:41,933 --> 00:39:43,367

to put dry ice and water in

I heat up the heavy cream,

73
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,733
then pour it
into the chocolate chips.

And once it's been sitting
for a few minutes, I mix it up.

Looks good.

00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:30,200
Normally, a volcano erupts
by its subduction zone,

81
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,467
where one plate is going
under the other plate.

82
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:36,167
Volcanoes have both
geology and weather.

83

of those things.

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:43,200
I'm making a raspberry sour

with a raspberry buttercream

86
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:47,700
because raspberry, of course,

87
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,833
definitely complements
raspberry.

88
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:53,600
And raspberry is one
of my favorite flavors.

-Good.
-Good.

92
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,067
I think it's really
smart to know

93
00:04:04,067 --> 00:04:05,600
what everyone else is baking

94
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,733
because you got to know
what you're up against.

95
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,400
What are you doing,

96
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,433

00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:15,633
Wow.

98
00:04:15,633 --> 00:04:17,933
It's only two hours.
You got to cook two cakes.

99
00:04:17,933 --> 00:04:19,367
And then
you have to shape it.

100
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:21,300
And then you have
to decorate it.

101
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,700
So you would think
it would be easy,

102
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:26,300
but really not so much.

103
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,067
I have never made
a volcano cake before.

104
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:30,367
But it can't be that hard.

105
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:33,733
How hard can it be to make
a Bundt cake and frost it

106
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,800
and make it look
exactly like a volcano?

107
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,600
I mean, really,
how hard can all of that be?

108
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,500
I've seen a volcano in,
uh, real life.

109
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,700
And I go to Hawaii
about once every year.

110
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:47,200
So I see it.
I've been to a volcano park.

111
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,800
And I've walked over volcanoes.

112

and a buttercream lava.

116
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:03,467
And it tastes pretty good
because it's, like, a dark,

117
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:08,167
rich flavor against
this tart flavor of lemon.

118
00:05:08,167 --> 00:05:09,800

And I made sure I covered it

with a towel because there was
a lot of stuff inside my bowl.

to go flying.

fully incorporated,

gonna give me moisture

286
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,633
Oh, my gosh.

287
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:05,400
Look at the size
of Reese's boulders!

288
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,833
DUFF:
They're bigger than him.

289
00:12:06,833 --> 00:12:10,633
I think he thought that
the boulder that I brought out,

290
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:12,333
he actually needed
to make them that size.

291
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,433
Yeah.

292
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:14,933
Mine are going to be
about this big.

293
00:12:14,933 --> 00:12:16,667
DYLIN: Whoa!

294
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:20,467
My boulders are going
to be way smaller than that.

295
00:12:20,467 --> 00:12:23,067
I checked the cakes.
And the cakes are done.

296
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,967
So for my boulders,
I start to use the cake.

297
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:28,133
And I roll it up
into a ball form.

298
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,067
And I start to mush it together.

299
00:12:30,067 --> 00:12:32,100
And then I wrap my nice,
thin fondant

300
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,367
around the cake balls

301
00:12:33,367 --> 00:12:36,300
to make sure that they're
nice and secure.

302
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,800
Justice, is that, uh...
What is that, igneous rock,

303
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,200
or sedimentary rock
or...

304
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,067
It's definitely not sedimentary

305
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,500
because sedimentary
is mostly in areas

306
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,300
that are flat.
-Okay.

307
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,800
It's probably volcanic ash.

308
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,467
If this is volcano eruption,

309
00:12:52,467 --> 00:12:54,967
it's, like, all these particles
go into the air.

310
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:56,733
And the wind just pushes it.

311
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:58,967
And then they, like,
rub against each other.

312
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:00,433
Like, in real thunderstorms,

313
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,433
the ice particles rub
against each other.

314
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:05,500
And the static electricity
makes lightning.

315
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,933
JASON: Time to melt
some more chocolate.

316
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:14,933
For my boulders...
Hot.

317
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:18,367
...I melt down some chocolate
on a double boiler

318
00:13:18,367 --> 00:13:20,500
and pour them into the molds

319
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,533
after I get them
out of the blast chiller...

320
00:13:22,533 --> 00:13:23,600
Ooh.

321
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,833
...and wrap the chocolate
in fondant.

322
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:28,067
When they bite into it,
they'll have a surprise,

323
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,967
a chocolaty surprise.

324
00:13:29,967 --> 00:13:31,767
Boulder.

325
00:13:31,767 --> 00:13:33,267
Oh, my God.

326
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,233
I'm deciding to make boulders
two different ways.

327
00:13:35,233 --> 00:13:37,067
For my first way,
it's gonna be black

328
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,733
and white fondant
mixed together.

329
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:42,267
And then for my second way, it's
gonna be chocolate in the molds.

330
00:13:42,267 --> 00:13:43,667
So this, I think,

331
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:45,933
will really help
my boulders stand out

332
00:13:45,933 --> 00:13:49,667
from the other bakers' boulders.

333
00:13:49,667 --> 00:13:51,567
KEILI: Holy moly!

334
00:13:51,567 --> 00:13:55,267
For my boulders,
I roll out my fondant.

335
00:13:55,267 --> 00:13:56,900
And I shape it
into little balls.

336
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,067
And I added chocolate chips
to give it that rough texture.

337
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:03,100
It totally looks
like a boulder.

338
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,700
Those are my boulders.

339
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,533
My hands are disgusting.

340
00:14:07,533 --> 00:14:11,233
To make my boulders,
I'm using black vanilla fondant

341
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:13,100
and chocolate flakes.

342
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,367
I'm dipping my boulders
inside the water

343
00:14:15,367 --> 00:14:17,300
so the flakes will stick.

344
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,600
And it looks nice.

345
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,300
Between you and me,
you already know this about me.

346
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,600
I am not happy
about boulders

347
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,133
being made purely
out of fondant.

348
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,433
DUFF:
Fondant's beautiful.

349
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,333
I can make really
awesome stuff with it.

350
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,833
But, like, I feel like pure
fondant's kind of a cop-out.

351
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:34,400
Yeah, I mean, if you're going
to put an edible boulder,

352
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,967
make it
a palatable boulder.

353
00:14:35,967 --> 00:14:38,767
-Mm-hmm.
-You know?

354
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:41,233
COLE: Boulders,
when I think boulders,

355
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,800
I immediately think truffles

356
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,400
because they're not perfect,
just like rocks.

357
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,433
I'm gonna make
my edible boulders

358
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:51,733
out of chopped pecans
and buttercream

359
00:14:51,733 --> 00:14:56,067
and top them off with
white chocolate and airbrush.

360
00:14:56,067 --> 00:14:57,433
I love using the airbrush

361
00:14:57,433 --> 00:15:00,467
because it adds
so much more detail.

362
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:02,133
And I'm pretty good at it.

363
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:04,500
There we go.

364
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,133
Cream-filled chocolate cookies.

365
00:15:07,133 --> 00:15:09,367
I grab the chocolate
sandwich cookies.

366
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:11,333
And I crush those up.

367
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,867
And I add some
heavy cream to them.

368
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:17,267
And then I separate it
into four different rocks

369
00:15:17,267 --> 00:15:19,300
and put them
in the blast chiller.

370
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:26,700
Almost everyone has
such good ideas for boulders.

371
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,967
And I'm still working
on my frosting.

372
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:32,300
My boulders, I don't want
to use fondant or gum paste

373
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,667
because I don't consider
those edible things.

374
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:37,433
I wouldn't eat them.

375
00:15:37,433 --> 00:15:41,767
Cream-filled cookie
boulders will have to work.

376
00:15:41,767 --> 00:15:44,500
And Audra's using cream-filled
cookies and something else.

377
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,067
So I think that I could make

378
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:47,933
some crushed up
cream-filled cookies

379
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:49,500
with some icing.

380
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,067
And those all go well
together in my opinion.

381
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:54,233
They smell really good.

382
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:56,400
20 minutes, guys!

383
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,533
Volcano cakes
and edible boulders.

384
00:16:02,433 --> 00:16:05,200
I really want my cake
to look like a volcano.

385
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,900
So I'm gonna take
some white chocolate ganache,

386
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,400
and dye it red,
orange and yellow

387
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,333
and drizzle it on top for lava.

388
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:14,767
And it looks, like, good.

389
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,767
Hashtag blessed.

390
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:22,067
This will be the cutest volcano.

391
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,467
I haven't seen a volcano before.

392
00:16:23,467 --> 00:16:25,467
But when my parents
were married,

393
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,500
they went on
a honeymoon to Hawaii.

394
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,633
And then they told me all
the different colors they saw.

395
00:16:29,633 --> 00:16:32,300
Purple and pink
were the big colors.

396
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,433
It's much happier.

397
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:38,333
For my boulders,
I have some extra buttercream

398
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,733
and some coconut flakes.

399
00:16:39,733 --> 00:16:42,433
And I rolled them up
into a ball together.

400
00:16:42,433 --> 00:16:44,767
Oh, my gosh.
It's working.

401
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:46,300
I covered 'em in gum paste

402
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,833
and used two chocolate-covered
blue candies

403
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:52,433
to make it look like ashes
just fell down on it.

404
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,933
And it's, like, really blue.

405
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:57,767
You got 15 minutes
left, bakers.

406
00:16:57,767 --> 00:16:59,467
Give us a volcano cake

407
00:16:59,467 --> 00:17:02,900
worthy of the "Kids
Baking Championship."

408
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,233
Oh, no.

409
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,467
I stacked my Bundt cakes.

410
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:08,300
* No, no, no, no, no, no, no *

411
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,133
And it starts falling apart.

412
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:14,100
It's raw.

413
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:17,100
I don't have enough time
to make another cake.

414
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,933
Ugh.

415
00:17:18,933 --> 00:17:21,167
No.

416
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,700
No-o-o-o-o.

417
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,633
It's raw.

418
00:17:30,633 --> 00:17:33,967
You got 15 minutes
left, bakers,

419
00:17:33,967 --> 00:17:36,600
volcano cakes
and edible boulders.

420
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,533
I don't have enough time
to make another cake.

421
00:17:40,533 --> 00:17:43,067
I'm going to throw this cake
back into the oven

422
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:46,533
and see if I can cook it
until it's done.

423
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:48,700
I'm just worried it
won't be cooked in time.

424
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,067
Ugh, has to be good enough.

425
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:57,733
I cannot keep those
in any longer.

426
00:17:57,733 --> 00:17:59,333
So I just take 'em out.

427
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:03,167
And it's broken.
It's broken.

428
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:05,500
It's not fully cooked.

429
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,700
My volcano has, like, imploded.

430
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,600
This is trash.

431
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,633
I have a second cake.
And I'm just wishing

432
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:19,400
that my second cake

433
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,167
doesn't crumble like the first

434
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:24,500
or else I will have
no cake to serve.

435
00:18:26,767 --> 00:18:28,633
Oh, God.
Oh, this is --

436
00:18:28,633 --> 00:18:32,667
this is falling a--
uh, it's broken.

437
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,400
All right, bakers, can I have
your attention for a sec?

438
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,400
I don't want your volcanoes
to look like Bundt cakes.

439
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,067
I want them to look
like volcanoes.

440
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:41,600
VALERIE:
Cake is very moldable.

441
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,167
So don't worry if your cake
didn't turn out perfectly.

442
00:18:44,167 --> 00:18:45,767
Mold it to the way
you want it.

443
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:48,067
And volcanoes come
in all different shapes

444
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,067
and sizes,
just like people.

445
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:51,667
Yep.

446
00:18:51,667 --> 00:18:53,567
Let's go with
the one-layer cake.

447
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,700
I'm running out of time.

448
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,100
And I decide to just
go with my small one.

449
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,800
I start pouring
the ganache over the cake

450
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:04,167
and then start decorating it
with some red fondant.

451
00:19:04,167 --> 00:19:07,067
A little circle around it.

452
00:19:09,067 --> 00:19:12,767
CHARLOTTE:
I decide to make cake balls
out of my crumbled cake

453
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,367
to help make up for the dent.

454
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:15,867
After that, I'm just,
like, frost it quickly.

455
00:19:15,867 --> 00:19:18,600
Make all my decorations
as quickly as possible.

456
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:23,900
At least I know it came out.

457
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,600
I get my cake out of the oven.
And it looks pretty good.

458
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,833
I would like to have
a tall volcano.

459
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:31,067
So I get the idea

460
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,133
to use my rice
marshmallow treats

461
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,067
to form them into a top layer.

462
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:37,700
I think it'll help me stand out.

463
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,767
It looks perfect.

464
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:40,433
For my decorations,

465
00:19:40,433 --> 00:19:43,800
I chose royal icing
to dye and use as lava,

466
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,433
which doesn't take too long

467
00:19:45,433 --> 00:19:48,867
except that it's super,
super, super thin.

468
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:52,067
Mine looks okay.
-Look at mine.

469
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:54,933
It's like the whole
entire cake erupted.

470
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:57,267
-On TV, it looks so easy.
-You know, and in real life,

471
00:19:57,267 --> 00:19:59,600
it's, like, ugh.

472
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,600
DUFF: 10 minutes, bakers,
you got 10 minutes,

473
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,767
volcano cakes
and edible boulders.

474
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:09,233
AIDAN: There's just one thing
I wanted to do.

475
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,500
But I don't know
if I'm gonna have enough time.

476
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,133
I wanted to make isomalt fire.

477
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:16,567
Isomalt is a special type
of sugar

478
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:19,833
that when you melt it down,
it does not turn brown.

479
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:21,967
And it can stand
against humidity.

480
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,433
I dye it red.

481
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:27,533
And I pour it over my ice
and let that cool.

482
00:20:27,533 --> 00:20:30,400
And when I come back to it,
I take it out.

483
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,233
And it looks so cool.

484
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:34,800
Oh, my gosh!

485
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,533
Whoa.
Aidan, that's awesome!

486
00:20:36,533 --> 00:20:40,033
It's gonna be my lava
exploding out of the cake.

487
00:20:41,433 --> 00:20:43,867
Okay, this looks the cutest.

488
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,200
My cake is going to be

489
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,167
the prettiest volcano
in the room.

490
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:51,833
The flowers will help it
look Hawaii-y.

491
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:54,367
I want to test that
my dry-ice container can fit.

492
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:55,667
So I just put it in there.

493
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:59,067
And it fits,
which I'm so happy about.

494
00:20:59,067 --> 00:21:02,133
Yay!
Okay.

495
00:21:02,133 --> 00:21:05,967
Bakers now have to
understand special effects.

496
00:21:05,967 --> 00:21:08,833
VALERIE: Well, then you've
ruined baking for everybody.

497
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,067
Literally my fault,
literally my fault.

498
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,500
It's all your fault.

499
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,167
You can't just bake
a three-tier cake anymore.

500
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:16,167
Like, "What?
It doesn't move?

501
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:18,767
It doesn't have
a laser in it?"

502
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:20,300
Five minutes left, bakers.

503
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,067
Make me a volcano.

504
00:21:22,067 --> 00:21:24,067
Make me some boulders.

505
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:27,433
And make it smoking!

506
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,733
I want to make
my volcano look realistic.

507
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:33,867
So I'm spray painting
it black and gray.

508
00:21:33,867 --> 00:21:36,300
It looks like a real volcano.

509
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,133
I'm doing the volcano dance.

510
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:42,067
* Da, da, da, da, da, da, da *

511
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,233
It's a volcano.

512
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:44,733
They're messy.
They're sloppy.

513
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:46,367
Things melt.
They're hot.

514
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,367
They all look different.

515
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,433
But what about
a volcano cake?

516
00:21:50,433 --> 00:21:52,333
I'm doing my finishing touches

517
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:55,567
by putting glitter
on top for lava.

518
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,333
It's Mount Colesaur.
It can have --

519
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,267
anything can happen.

520
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:03,367
In my mind, I want
a perfect volcano

521
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:06,100
on a perfect tropical island,

522
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
just for me.

523
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,067
Perfect.

524
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:10,300
Wow.

525
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:11,933
DUFF: One minute!

526
00:22:11,933 --> 00:22:13,267
Final touches, make sure

527
00:22:13,267 --> 00:22:16,233
your volcanoes look
like volcanoes,

528
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:17,767
which means melty
and sloppy.

529
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:20,067
AIDAN: You know, if Duff
wants a messy volcano,

530
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:23,533
he's gonna get a messy volcano.

531
00:22:23,533 --> 00:22:25,767
Man, you guys, I'm stoked
about these volcanoes,

532
00:22:25,767 --> 00:22:28,300
they look awesome.

533
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:31,200
AUDRA: Cream-filled
chocolate cookies.

534
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,133
Throwing stuff together
and hope it's good.

535
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:36,167
5...4...

536
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:39,533
-3...
-2...1...

537
00:22:39,533 --> 00:22:41,233
Hands up!

538
00:22:41,233 --> 00:22:43,867
My cake is really short.

539
00:22:43,867 --> 00:22:48,467
And it looked more like
a Bundt cake than a volcano.

540
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,467
Not the best cake.

541
00:22:49,467 --> 00:22:52,733
So we asked
for volcanoes,

542
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,300
smoking and boulders.

543
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:55,400
-Yep.
-Edible.

544
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:57,500
-Yes.
-Are you ready for this?

545
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,100
Audra!

546
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,933
Hello!

547
00:23:00,933 --> 00:23:03,400
This is our second time
facing the judges.

548
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,267
And you'd think it would
get a little bit easier.

549
00:23:06,267 --> 00:23:08,167
But it's just
nerve-wracking.

550
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:12,567
There's no really way
to react -- relax.

551
00:23:14,733 --> 00:23:17,433
To be honest,
it's not my best work.

552
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:21,300
But I feel like it's a big
step up from my cupcake.

553
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,800
Well, I want
to fire it up.

554
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,800
I want to see what it looks like
smoking like a volcano.

555
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,333
Yeah!
Let's see it.

556
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,233
Yeah!

557
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:34,800
Oh, that was awesome.

558
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,367
That volcano is angry.

559
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:39,800
Probably from me frosting it
with so much lava.

560
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,500
I want to taste this cake.
This is just too much fun.

561
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:48,300
It is a raspberry sour cream
Bundt cake

562
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,500
with a plain
vanilla frosting.

563
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,833
Here you go.

564
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:53,867
-Thank you very much, Audra.
-Thank you, Audra.

565
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,333
Uh-oh, Audra.

566
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,233
I think it's a little
underbaked.

567
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,467
-It is.
-A little raw right here.

568
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:01,067
Well, you got
an undercooked one.

569
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,833
And mine tastes
a little overcooked.

570
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,200
Right in the middle,
it's perfect.

571
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,067
Eat that middle then,
okay?

572
00:24:07,067 --> 00:24:08,967
Drill -- drill it
down the middle.

573
00:24:08,967 --> 00:24:11,067
Tell me
about your boulders.

574
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:15,767
I made them with cream-filled
chocolate sandwich cookies.

575
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:17,500
The boulder, I'm wondering

576
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:19,833
if it should have been
baked or something

577
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,733
because it just tastes
like raw cookie dough.

578
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:25,300
It's less like a boulder
and more like a mudslide.

579
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,533
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

580
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,900
Justice.

581
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,400
That's so fun!

582
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,767
Justice, how does a volcano
affect the weather?

583
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:40,633
If it erupts, like, all the ash
will go into the sky

584
00:24:40,633 --> 00:24:43,233
and block out the sun.
Like, it happened once.

585
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,500
"The year of no summer"
is what they called it

586
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:49,100
because it made
everything so cold.

587
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,667
-I love you, Justice.
-It's amazing.

588
00:24:50,667 --> 00:24:53,600
I love science.
What flavor cake is it?

589
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,633
I made a raspberry cake
with raspberry buttercream.

590
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:58,767
And for the boulders,
I took cake scraps.

591
00:24:58,767 --> 00:25:01,567
And I molded them together
and put fondant on top of it.

592
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,500
Justice,
I really like the fact

593
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,267
that you used cake pops
as your boulders.

594
00:25:06,267 --> 00:25:07,567
Smart thinking.
It doesn't look like you

595
00:25:07,567 --> 00:25:09,400
put too much fondant
on there.

596
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,633
Thank you.
So it's all the same cake, yeah?

597
00:25:11,633 --> 00:25:13,700
-Yeah.
-Taste the raspberry.

598
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,067
Yeah, you do.

599
00:25:15,067 --> 00:25:16,300
I got good raspberry
flavor in here.

600
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,633
I can really taste it.

601
00:25:17,633 --> 00:25:19,100
Um, but I think
you probably

602
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,933
could've pulled this out
about 10 minutes earlier.

603
00:25:20,933 --> 00:25:22,233
-Okay.
-Cake got a little bit dry

604
00:25:22,233 --> 00:25:24,267
and a little bit
torched on the bottom.

605
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:25,933
Other than that, man,
I really like your volcano.

606
00:25:25,933 --> 00:25:27,100
Thank you.

607
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,467
It's nice because
you went tropical.

608
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:30,233
You know, so you got
palm trees on there.

609
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,667
You got boulders.
And I think it's good

610
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:33,967
that you took the time
to do the yellow and the red.

611
00:25:33,967 --> 00:25:35,200
Great job.
-Thank you.

612
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,533
Thank you.

613
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:39,900
All right.
You ready to call in Charlotte?

614
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,267
-Yes.
-Charlotte!

615
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,933
CHARLOTTE: I'm really nervous
they're not gonna like my cake.

616
00:25:46,933 --> 00:25:51,200
I'm just like, ah, blegh.

617
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,067
Before we taste it,
I think we should make it smoke.

618
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:56,067
Okay.

619
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:58,633
All right.
Let's see it.

620
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,467
Yeah.
Look at that.

621
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,133
I've actually always
wanted to do that.

622
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:06,200
So I'm really excited.

623
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,767
Tell us all
about your volcano.

624
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:12,600
It's a ginger cake
with a chocolate frosting.

625
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:18,067
And the boulders are black
and white chocolate and fondant.

626
00:26:18,067 --> 00:26:19,267
Charlotte, look.

627
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:20,700
I dig your volcano.
I think it looks good.

628
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,267
You know, you got
some nice colors on there.

629
00:26:22,267 --> 00:26:24,067
You got yellow.
You got orange.

630
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:25,633
I think it's
a little short, though.

631
00:26:25,633 --> 00:26:28,567
It's a crumbling volcano
because it's a very old volcano.

632
00:26:28,567 --> 00:26:30,900
Gotcha. Now, did you
work on that story

633
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,467
after you made
the volcano?

634
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:35,533
Um, I worked on the story
after I made the cake.

635
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:37,500
So...

636
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,067
Ginger and chocolate,
I'm excited.

637
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:41,533
Mm-hmm.

638
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,567
I see raw bits.

639
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,533
Oh, my gosh.

640
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,067
Okay, I'm really nervous.

641
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:57,367
Hmm.

642
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:58,833
Oh, I wonder if it's done
all the way, Charlotte.

643
00:26:58,833 --> 00:27:02,400
Charlotte, you got --
your cake is very underbaked.

644
00:27:10,933 --> 00:27:13,367
So ginger chocolate.
Mm-hmm.

645
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:16,767
Mm.

646
00:27:16,767 --> 00:27:18,667
I don't think that's
a good look on your face.

647
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:20,067
I'm nervous.
-No, no.

648
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,333
Are you doing
the nervous hand dance?

649
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:23,433
Yeah.
I'm ah, ah!

650
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:27,067
Hmm.

651
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,133
Charlotte, your cake
is very underbaked.

652
00:27:30,133 --> 00:27:32,133
How long did
you bake it for?

653
00:27:32,133 --> 00:27:34,100
About 45 minutes.

654
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,567
This cake
is 90% raw.

655
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:39,067
Duff, no offense,

656
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:43,433
but that is at least
50% baked.

657
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:46,167
Chocolate's good, though.
I like your flavors.

658
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,667
I think the frosting
was really good.

659
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:50,833
But I would've liked the cake
baked a little bit longer.

660
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:52,067
Okay.

661
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,167
I don't taste
much ginger, either.

662
00:27:53,167 --> 00:27:54,800
I can taste
the chocolate.

663
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,333
Um, yeah, I'm really used
to not putting too much ginger.

664
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:57,967
But if you're going to make
a ginger cake...

665
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,300
Yeah.

666
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,133
...you got to have it
ginger flavor.

667
00:28:01,133 --> 00:28:03,267
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thanks, Charlotte.

668
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:08,867
Maya?

669
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:10,233
I didn't see her there
for a second.

670
00:28:10,233 --> 00:28:11,700
Yeah, where...
Maya, you can come on out.

671
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,600
Oh, there you are!
-Oh, there you are!

672
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,233
Yeah, she gets it
all the time.

673
00:28:15,233 --> 00:28:17,167
She's done.

674
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:19,067
I think we should see

675
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:21,367
what this volcano looks
like when it smokes.

676
00:28:23,567 --> 00:28:25,333
-Oh, it's so pretty!
-If I was going

677
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,933
to have to perish
in a lava accident,

678
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:29,200
I would much rather
have, like,

679
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:32,067
happy pink lava than,
like, angry red lava.

680
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:33,700
Thank you.

681
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,100
I have made, for you,

682
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:38,067
a vanilla sour cream
Bundt cake

683
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:40,633
with a vanilla
buttercream frosting.

684
00:28:40,633 --> 00:28:42,600
How did you make
your boulders?

685
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:46,067
I put coconut flakes
and buttercream

686
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:49,400
and then put gum
paste over there.

687
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,767
I taste the sour cream.

688
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:53,800
And I do like that
extra flavor in there.

689
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,367
It seems like it's
a little overcooked.

690
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,667
It's not as moist
as I would expect it to be.

691
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,267
-Okay.
-But it's good flavor.

692
00:28:59,267 --> 00:29:01,367
I can taste the vanilla.
I can taste it in your frosting.

693
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:02,967
I can taste it
in your cake.

694
00:29:02,967 --> 00:29:04,467
I love
the coconut boulders...

695
00:29:04,467 --> 00:29:06,100
-Yeah, look at that.
-...because I love coconut.

696
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,667
I like
the coconut in here.

697
00:29:07,667 --> 00:29:09,500
But I think you
could've toasted it.

698
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,700
Mm.

699
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,567
Give you a lot
more round flavor in there.

700
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:14,100
Maya, great job.
-Thank you.

701
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,567
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Maya.

702
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,633
Hello, Dylin.
Let's see if it smokes.

703
00:29:21,633 --> 00:29:22,667
Okay.

704
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,600
Yes, look at that.

705
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,233
-I love it!
-Yeah, it looks great.

706
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:32,100
I have a vanilla Bundt cake

707
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,933
with a rice-cereal
treat second layer.

708
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,333
And for boulders,

709
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,300
I have rice cereal treats
covered in fondant.

710
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:42,833
I don't know
if it was finished cooking.

711
00:29:42,833 --> 00:29:45,100
I could've left it
in the oven a little bit longer.

712
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,700
-Yeah, you could've.
-Maybe a lot longer.

713
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,867
All right. So Dylin,
you've got a couple problems.

714
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,367
Your cake was underbaked.

715
00:29:50,367 --> 00:29:52,433
And your royal icing
turned into liquid.

716
00:29:52,433 --> 00:29:54,333
You know, your ratio
was way off.

717
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:56,167
You know, this is,
like, translucent.

718
00:29:56,167 --> 00:29:58,067
You want royal icing
to be opaque.

719
00:29:58,067 --> 00:29:59,733
Your flavors are great,
you know, good job.

720
00:29:59,733 --> 00:30:01,700
I love your boulders.
I love the way they look.

721
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,000
Your cereal treats

722
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,333
could've used a little
bit more marshmallow

723
00:30:05,333 --> 00:30:07,100
and a little bit
more butter.

724
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
Yeah, just a few issues
with your baking.

725
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,933
Keili.

726
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:16,400
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

727
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,800
Uh, that looks
like a volcano!

728
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,033
That looks like
a craggy, gnarly volcano.

729
00:30:21,033 --> 00:30:23,100
Looks really good!

730
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,000
I made a lemon Bundt cake

731
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,133
with a chocolate ganache
frosting

732
00:30:27,133 --> 00:30:30,933
and a reddish-orangish
buttercream lava.

733
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:35,067
And my rocks are fondant
with chocolate chips in it.

734
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,533
And it's, like, sprinkled.

735
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:41,133
I'm not a big fan of fondant
being overly used.

736
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,000
Some people really like
lemon and chocolate.

737
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,233
I, personally, don't think

738
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,800
it really goes
that well together.

739
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:49,433
Lemons might be just a little
too acidic for chocolate.

740
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,633
-I like it.
-Of course you do.

741
00:30:52,633 --> 00:30:55,600
The edge is really
crispy and crunchy.

742
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,800
So it really tastes good.

743
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,267
But the cake is
definitely overcooked

744
00:30:58,267 --> 00:30:59,833
because it's a little
on the dry side.

745
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:03,300
I think you have a cake
that is really interesting.

746
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,067
And I think your frosting
is really, really good.

747
00:31:05,067 --> 00:31:06,233
Okay.

748
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:08,067
But the chocolate
with the lemon,

749
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:09,467
I think
it's a little weird.

750
00:31:09,467 --> 00:31:11,933
-I do not.
-My partner in crime here...

751
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:14,933
Thank you, Keili.

752
00:31:14,933 --> 00:31:17,467
Hi, Reese!
-Hello.

753
00:31:17,467 --> 00:31:21,800
More, more,
there you go.

754
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,133
-Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

755
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,467
That's so good!

756
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,533
I made a vanilla Bundt cake

757
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:30,433
with a American
chocolate buttercream.

758
00:31:30,433 --> 00:31:34,900
My boulders are rice-cereal
treats covered in black fondant.

759
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:38,267
I'm a little concerned
about the scale of the boulders

760
00:31:38,267 --> 00:31:40,367
to the volcano.
-Okay.

761
00:31:40,367 --> 00:31:42,567
The volcano doesn't look
as big and massive

762
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,500
because the boulders
are so big.

763
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:48,367
I'm sure I could change my mind
if it tastes really good.

764
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,167
Boulder is -- Ooh.
It exploded.

765
00:31:51,167 --> 00:31:54,133
Okay, this is
a very hard treat.

766
00:31:56,267 --> 00:31:57,633
Did you put any
butter in this?

767
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,867
-No.
-You didn't put any butter in?

768
00:32:00,867 --> 00:32:03,833
I forgot my butter.

769
00:32:03,833 --> 00:32:05,700
This is horrible.

770
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,500
ANNOUNCER:
Ordinary chocolate cakes melt

771
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,967
into molten lava Bundt cakes.

772
00:32:10,967 --> 00:32:12,200
Right after this.

773
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:22,067
ANNOUNCER: How to make mini
Bundt lava cakes.

774
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,633
Gather together mini Bundt pan,
chocolate cake batter,

775
00:32:25,633 --> 00:32:28,367
rock candy,
white chocolate chips

776
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:30,533
and red food coloring.

777
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:35,567
Fill your Bundt pan with batter
and bake off the cakes.

778
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,400
Use a mallet to crush
your rock candy.

779
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,667
Melt your chocolate chips
in the microwave.

780
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,067
And add food coloring
to make red lava.

781
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:47,300
Scoop the tops of the cake
out and let the lava flow.

782
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,900
Add the crushed rock
candy for texture.

783
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:52,100

00:32:54,733 --> 00:32:57,767
DUFF: That is...

786
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,667
Reese, when we asked you
to make boulders,

787
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:03,567
we didn't mean
an actual boulder.

788
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:05,533
Did you put any
butter in this?

789
00:33:05,533 --> 00:33:06,933
No, I forgot to.

790
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:08,433
The marshmallows
are just sugar.

791
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,233
You know how sugar
can get really hard?

792
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:11,600
-Yeah.
-Without any butter,

793
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,400
there's nothing
for it to play with.

794
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,567
Okay.

795
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:15,600
Reese, I think you made
a really good cake.

796
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,633
The flavor's awesome.

797
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:18,133
It's just a little
on the dry side.

798
00:33:18,133 --> 00:33:19,567
And, man, these boulders,

799
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:22,067
remember, next time,
you got to put butter in there.

800
00:33:22,067 --> 00:33:24,467
-Thank you, Reese.
-Thank you.

801
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:29,800
How's it going, Cole?

802
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,467
Good.

803
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:34,300
Nice.

804
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:38,100
That is the most sparkly
volcano I've ever seen.

805
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:40,167
It's a chocolate-cinnamon cake

806
00:33:40,167 --> 00:33:42,800
with chocolate-covered
strawberry buttercream.

807
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,733
And the lava is white
chocolate ganache.

808
00:33:45,733 --> 00:33:49,067
It looks like a really clean,
really beautiful cake

809
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:51,367
and not as much
of a volcano.

810
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:52,767
But you definitely
have some skills.

811
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,367
Thank you.

812
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:57,700
The cinnamon and the chocolate
together is so perfect.

813
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,267
It's such a moist cake.
-Thank you.

814
00:34:00,267 --> 00:34:02,700
Uh, for me, I think it's
a little bit too much cinnamon.

815
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:04,067
No!

816
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:05,500
It's okay to disagree
with me sometimes.

817
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,300
It's okay. Like, we have
difference of opinion.

818
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,300
-I trust you.
-All right.

819
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,933
Let me see about
this boulder here.

820
00:34:11,933 --> 00:34:13,867
A pecan truffle.

821
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,600
I love the idea

822
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,300
of the pecans covered
in the white chocolate.

823
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:19,667
It tastes so good.

824
00:34:19,667 --> 00:34:22,567
It's like a really
great piece of candy.

825
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:25,267
Cole, you are
an impressive baker, man.

826
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:28,533
Thanks a lot.
-Thank you.

827
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:30,900
Kaniyah.

828
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,167
Yeah!

829
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,900
How fun is that?

830
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,533
Mind-blowing!

831
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:41,200
I made a strawberry Bundt cake

832
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,133
with chocolate flake buttercream

833
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:45,067
to present the dirt and sand

834
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:48,400
and used red chocolate
for the lava.

835
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,300
Frosting is really good.
I can taste the chocolate.

836
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,467
It goes really, really nice
with the strawberries.

837
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,067
I love it!

838
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:56,467
I get that little bit of fruit
in there

839
00:34:56,467 --> 00:34:58,367
with the really
moist cake.

840
00:34:58,367 --> 00:35:00,267
What about your boulders?

841
00:35:00,267 --> 00:35:03,067
I used
black vanilla fondant

842
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:07,233
and covered it
in chocolate flakes.

843
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:08,700
Feels like a boulder.

844
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:11,200
Looks like a bowling ball
covered in sprinkles.

845
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,067
That's all fondant, huh?

846
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:14,400
Yeah.
I'm sorry.

847
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,767
Oh, don't ever apologize,
honey.

848
00:35:16,767 --> 00:35:18,467
I don't necessarily want
to taste one of your boulders.

849
00:35:18,467 --> 00:35:20,533
But it looks
really great.

850
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:22,500
Look. I think you made
a cool-looking volcano.

851
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,933
-Absolutely.
-It's dark.

852
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:25,600
It's got a lot
of boulders on it.

853
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,567
-Thank you very much.
-Thanks, Kaniyah, great job.

854
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,200
Thank you.

855
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,600
Aidan, I want
to see that thing smoke.

856
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:38,067
Nice.
-I love it!

857
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:40,633
I love how it's going
around all the sugar

858
00:35:40,633 --> 00:35:41,733
and the boulders.

859
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:42,933
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah.

860
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,467
Tell me
how you made the sugar.

861
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:47,400
AIDAN: I melted isomalt
and added some red dye.

862
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,500
Okay.

863
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,933
And then I poured it
over a tub of ice.

864
00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:53,267
I didn't learn how to do that
until I was about probably,

865
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:54,833
like, 25 or so.

866
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,267
Where did you learn
how to do that?

867
00:35:56,267 --> 00:36:00,067
Uh, I actually saw it
on a baking championship.

868
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:02,200
And I was like,
"Wow, that's cool!

869
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,833
I want to try that."
-Huh.

870
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:05,800
Good job, man.

871
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,867
It's a passion fruit cake.

872
00:36:07,867 --> 00:36:10,467
And it has a banana buttercream.

873
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,533
Mm!

874
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:17,267
Aidan, that is
such a moist cake!

875
00:36:17,267 --> 00:36:20,300
Tastes like it was
soaked in passion fruit.

876
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,733
The passion fruit's
awesome!

877
00:36:21,733 --> 00:36:23,100
The banana's awesome!

878
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,467
Everything really
goes together, man.

879
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:28,067
It really,
really tastes good.

880
00:36:28,067 --> 00:36:29,100
Tell me
about your boulders.

881
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,733
It's cream-filled cookies.

882
00:36:30,733 --> 00:36:34,233
And I crushed up the cookies
and mixed it with the frosting.

883
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,867
I hope that
there's a company

884
00:36:35,867 --> 00:36:38,433
that makes these sandwich
cookies watching right now

885
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:40,467
because these
sandwich cookies

886
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:42,567
with the
banana-flavored frosting

887
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,533
all crushed up
is amazing.

888
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:45,500
Mm-hmm, yeah.

889
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,200
Somebody needs to make
those ASAP.

890
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,567
-I agree.
-And then...

891
00:36:48,567 --> 00:36:50,167
-Wholeheartedly.
-...pay you for the idea.

892
00:36:50,167 --> 00:36:51,600
I wish the volcano was
a little taller,

893
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,467
looked a little bit
more like a volcano.

894
00:36:53,467 --> 00:36:55,867
But once you bite into
that cake, it doesn't matter.

895
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:57,733
That tastes so good!

896
00:36:57,733 --> 00:36:59,367
-Good job, Aidan.
-Well done, well done.

897
00:36:59,367 --> 00:37:02,567
-Bye.
-Bye.

898
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,467
Jason, I want to see
that thing smoke.

899
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:08,367
-Woo-hoo!
-That never gets old.

900
00:37:08,367 --> 00:37:09,833
That never gets old.
Look at me.

901
00:37:09,833 --> 00:37:13,267
I've been doing this for years.
And I still love it.

902
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:15,567
I'm looking at that
beautiful Bundt cake.

903
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,233
And I'm not feeling
volcano a lot.

904
00:37:18,233 --> 00:37:22,067
It's not very tall
because my first Bundt cake

905
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:24,400
came out raw.
-Hmm.

906
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,500
And I kept checking on it
and it wasn't cooking.

907
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,067
Maybe because you kept
checking on it.

908
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:29,500
Yeah, okay.

909
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,333
So tell us all
about your cake.

910
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:34,267
It's a chocolate Bundt cake.

911
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:37,733
And I have red fondant
for the lava.

912
00:37:37,733 --> 00:37:39,467
You're looking more
like a brownie.

913
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:41,133
There's a lot
of chocolate in there.

914
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,067
It is chocolaty!

915
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:46,667
Oh, boy.

916
00:37:46,667 --> 00:37:47,833
That's not good.

917
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,067
Wow.

918
00:37:49,067 --> 00:37:50,600
That's -- that's intense
chocolate flavor.

919
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,667
You wanted chocolate cake.
You gave us a chocolate cake.

920
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,067
And tell us all
about your boulders.

921
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,767
The boulders
are chocolate molded

922
00:38:02,767 --> 00:38:04,867
and gray fondant around it.

923
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,200
I'm gonna cut
into this boulder.

924
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,233
Okay, so the chocolate
is really chocolaty.

925
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:13,433
-Yeah.
-And I'm a little --

926
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:14,733
I'm...
Now here's the thing.

927
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:16,067
Oh, no.

928
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:18,267
After a mouthful
of chocolate like that,

929
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:21,433
I kind of feel like
a solid chocolate boulder

930
00:38:21,433 --> 00:38:23,567
might be
a little much.

931
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:26,500
What do you think?

932
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,700
Oh, my God.

933
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:30,133
When you've got chocolate
on chocolate

934
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,433
on chocolate
on chocolate,

935
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,100
it doesn't give
your palate any time

936
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,500
to enjoy
the actual chocolate

937
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,700
because your palate
is so overwhelmed.

938
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,500
So you want to be
able to release that

939
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,267
a little bit
with different flavors

940
00:38:40,267 --> 00:38:42,567
so your tongue just doesn't
become bored with chocolate,

941
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:45,467
if that's possible.
-Rah!

942
00:38:45,467 --> 00:38:50,533
I hope my volcano cake
doesn't blow it for me.

943
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:52,533
Chocolate!

944
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,300
Look at these guys.

945
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,600
Two celebrities are
just staring at us.

946
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,333
And smiling.

947
00:39:05,333 --> 00:39:09,533
Bakers, three of you
were on fire today.

948
00:39:11,233 --> 00:39:14,567
Cole, your chocolate-cinnamon
volcano cake

949
00:39:14,567 --> 00:39:18,067
is picture perfect,
almost too perfect.

950
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:21,967
And your cake and frosting
were really nicely executed.

951
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:24,067
REESE: Good job.

952
00:39:24,067 --> 00:39:26,967
Aidan, your
passion fruit cake

953
00:39:26,967 --> 00:39:31,300
with banana buttercream
was erupting with flavor.

954
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,700
Thanks.

955
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:36,567
And your lava sugar work,
that was really impressive.

956
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,200
Kaniyah, your airbrushed
strawberry cake

957
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,700
was moist and so tasty.

958
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:49,233
And it really looked
like a volcano.

959
00:39:49,233 --> 00:39:50,800
-Good job.
-Good job.

960
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,767
However, there was
one baker's volcano cake

961
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:59,100
that really blew the lid
off of this challenge.

962
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,667
And that baker is...

963
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,100
...Aidan.

964
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,533
AIDAN: When I first saw
this challenge, my thought was,

965
00:40:09,533 --> 00:40:12,833
"I can't make a volcano cake."

966
00:40:12,833 --> 00:40:14,567
And I won!

967
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:17,133
Now, the following bakers
had an uphill battle

968
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:18,433
but still gave us cakes

969
00:40:18,433 --> 00:40:20,467
that were good enough
to make the grade.

970
00:40:20,467 --> 00:40:23,167
And those bakers
are...

971
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,833
Keili...
-Yay.

972
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:27,567
-...Maya...
-Good job.

973
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,233
-...Justice...
-Oh, thank you.

974
00:40:31,233 --> 00:40:34,467
-...Audra...
-Oh, my God, yay!

975
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,700
...and Reese.

976
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,300
Yay!

977
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,600
Okay. So that leaves
Charlotte, Dylin, Jason.

978
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,300
Please step forward.

979
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:51,133
No!

980
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:53,200
VALERIE: Charlotte,
we couldn't taste

981
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,100
the ginger
in your ginger cake.

982
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,200
And it was extremely
underbaked.

00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,733
90 minutes.

157
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,333
Oh, don't close that.
Don't close that.

158
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:47,767
Comfort Food
Dessert Imposters.

159
00:06:47,767 --> 00:06:52,767
They have to be deceiving
but delicious.

160
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,433
Hope this works.

161
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:57,567
I'm making a chili made out
of chocolate ganache,

162
00:06:57,567 --> 00:07:01,700
pistachio and almonds,
and cake "chicken."

163
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,067
Almonds and pistachios

164
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:06,500
are gonna be
my beans in my chili.

165
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:10,100
When I eat chili, I usually have
tortilla strips in my chili.

166
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,467
For my tortilla strips,

167
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:15,367
I will be using phyllo dough.

168
00:07:15,367 --> 00:07:17,067
Of all the things to make today,

169
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:19,367
I had to make a hot dog
out of cake.

170
00:07:19,367 --> 00:07:21,800
-Oh, wow.
-For my diner comfort food,

171
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,200
I am making
a vanilla cake hot dog bun

172
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,667
with a buttercream hot dog.

173
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:30,333
I'm making a vanilla cake
for my hot dog bun

174
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,467
'cause it's kind of
a stiff batter,

175
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,767
and it doesn't crumble too much.

176
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,267
DUFF: All right.
How's it goin', Dylin?

177
00:07:37,267 --> 00:07:39,400
Going way better
than it normally has.

178
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,767
Okay. That's good.
That's good.

179
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,367
So, uh, what is
your Dessert Imposter?

180
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:45,100
-Mine is hot dogs.
-All right.

181
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,700
So how do you eat
your hot dogs?

182
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,067
I eat my hot dog with my hands
and with, like, two bites.

183
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,867
[ Laughing ]

184
00:07:52,867 --> 00:07:55,500
I meant, like, what do you --
What do you put on top of 'em?

185
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,533
Oh. I put on top
ketchup and mustard.

186
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:01,200
-Wait. Did you say ketchup?
-Yes.

187
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,300
I really feel
that ketchup on a hot dog

188
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,100
is just un-American.

189
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:09,167
-Why?
-I just -- Ugh.

190
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:11,100
Ketchup on fries.
Mustard on hot dogs.

191
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,767
But ketchup's awesome
on hot dogs.

192
00:08:12,767 --> 00:08:14,267
Is it? Ugh.

193
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:16,733
Hey, who in here puts ketchup
on their hot dog?

194
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,467
-Me!
-Me.

195
00:08:18,467 --> 00:08:20,733
-Ketchup!
-You're all wrong.

196
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:23,433
-No, we're not.
-Dude, that's totally gross.

197
00:08:23,433 --> 00:08:25,367
Awesome.
[ Both laugh ]

198
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,233
-All right, man. Good luck.
-Thank you.

199
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:30,400
-You're making a chocolate cake?
-I am.

200
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,567
Looks good.

201
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:34,633
On my diner ticket,
I got meatloaf.

202
00:08:34,633 --> 00:08:37,200
I have made
Dessert Imposters before.

203
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,200
I am gonna win this challenge.

204
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,267
I'm gonna make
a easy chocolate cake

205
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,300
with a strawberry coulis.

206
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,567
But I don't want it
to be boring.

207
00:08:44,567 --> 00:08:46,233
So I'm gonna infuse it
with coffee.

208
00:08:46,233 --> 00:08:48,100
-Coffee.
-Coffee.

209
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,567
Coffee really brings out
the flavor of cocoa,

210
00:08:50,567 --> 00:08:52,733
like, in the best way possible.

211
00:08:52,733 --> 00:08:54,833
And I'm pouring
the batter in my pan.

212
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:55,933
But I feel like I can add

213
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,633
a little more texture
on the top.

214
00:08:57,633 --> 00:09:02,067
So I chop up some pecans
and sprinkle them right on top.

215
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:05,067
One hour left, bakers!

216
00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:07,200
I don't know
if I have enough time.

217
00:09:10,533 --> 00:09:12,100
Hmm.

218
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,467
That's not good.

219
00:09:13,467 --> 00:09:16,467
The cake is oozing
out of the side

220
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:20,600
and dropping to the bottom
and burning.

221
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Ai-yai-yai.

222
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,200
COLE: This is not good.

223
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,200
The cake is oozing
out of the side.

224
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,933
I don't know
what I'm gonna do right now.

225
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:37,900
But I know I have to fix it.

226
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,467
Ai-yai-yai.

227
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:45,067
So I decided to put a layer
of aluminum foil over the cake.

228
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:49,067
It's gonna keep the batter
from continuing to spill out.

229
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,767
I hope this helps.

230
00:09:50,767 --> 00:09:52,400
Okay. This could work.

231
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,333
I grab a sheet pan,
unwrap my dough,

232
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:57,867
and start to cut it
to look like noodles.

233
00:09:57,867 --> 00:10:02,000
It's gonna take forever
to roll them all out.

234

235
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:08,400
VALERIE:
I love watchin' the kids bake.

236
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,567
I love tasting
all of their desserts.

237
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:12,700
But, you know, sometimes
I just want somethin' salty.

238
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,467
Yeah.
Me, too.

239
00:10:14,467 --> 00:10:17,700
I think they're just snacking.
I hope they're just snacking.

240
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,733
Bakers, can we have
your attention, please?

241
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,567
-Uh-oh.
-No.

242
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:26,000
We have decided
to spice up the big bake.

243
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,400
We want Dessert Imposter
chips and salsa.

244
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,233
-Chips and salsa?
-You guys get it?

245
00:10:31,233 --> 00:10:33,333
You got to make
chips and salsa.

246
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,200
But you can't use
chips or salsa.

247
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,033
Thank you so much.

248
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,833
Another Dessert Imposter.

249
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:41,667
Actually, that's gonna
go perfect with my burrito.

250
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:44,767
JASON: Duff and Valerie
want chips and salsa.

251
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,200
I got this.

252
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,667
I'm making a burrito

253
00:10:49,667 --> 00:10:52,167
with pound-cake chicken

254
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,367
and buttercream sour cream,

255
00:10:54,367 --> 00:10:57,833
using crepes for my tortilla.

256
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,233
Crepe time.

257
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,467
I want to be
the kids baking champion

258
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,800
because I want to start
my own crepe business.

259
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,900
I am amazing at crepes.

260
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:13,233
I'm using eggs, salt,
sugar, butter, and flour.

261
00:11:13,233 --> 00:11:16,133
Ah, that's some
nice crepe batter.

262
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,100
So I wait for the crepe
to start bubbling,

263
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,467
little small bubbles at the top,

264
00:11:22,467 --> 00:11:25,067
kind of like when
you're cooking a pancake.

265
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,533
That's how you know
when to flip it.

266
00:11:26,533 --> 00:11:28,333
Wait 30 seconds.

267
00:11:28,333 --> 00:11:30,333
And then my crepe is done.

268
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,267
For my chips and salsa,

269
00:11:32,267 --> 00:11:34,500
I'm gonna make my chips
out of crepes.

270
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,233
I'm gonna cut it into triangles,

271
00:11:37,233 --> 00:11:39,100
fry them until they're crispy.

272
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,500
This is crispy.
And for my salsa,

273
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,600
I'm gonna be using two
different colors

274
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,567
of milk chocolate

275
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:48,600
and some leftover buttercream
from my burritos.

276
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,233
I'm doin' okay.

277
00:11:50,233 --> 00:11:52,433
I'm crying on the inside.

278
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:56,067
I have to stop what I'm doing
and make chips and salsa.

279
00:11:56,067 --> 00:11:58,067
Right now is not the right time,

280
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,700
when I'm still
mixing this batter.

281
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,533
Then I'm making
a white cake sandwich bread,

282
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,067
a peanut butter chip
buttercream,

283
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:10,533
and a grape buttercream filling.

284
00:12:10,533 --> 00:12:11,800
Gonna make the white cake

285
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,300
because most peanut butter
and jelly bread is white.

286
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,667
I need to get these in right now

287
00:12:18,667 --> 00:12:21,600
so I can get started
on my chips and salsa.

288
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,333
For my chips,
I have leftover cake batter.

289
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,267
I'm gonna make it thin.
I'm gonna bake it for a bit.

290
00:12:27,267 --> 00:12:29,533
Then I'm gonna throw it
in the fryer and fry it,

291
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:31,833
then toss it
in cinnamon and sugar.

292
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,067
I guess, for my salsa,
I'm just gonna throw together

293
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,967
chocolate malt coconut flakes

294
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:39,267

I should use as my salsa.

I'm not gonna worry
about that right now

'cause I've got
other things to do.

Delicious butter and chocolate.

00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:56,867
My trick to making
really fudgy brownies

302
00:12:56,867 --> 00:13:01,700
is adding more butter
and chocolate to them.

303
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:05,667
[ Laughing ] I'm getting
emotional about these brownies.

304

They're gonna live happily
ever after in the oven

00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:09,067
until I take them out.

306
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:12,500
For my chips, I'm going
to make sugar-cookie chips...

307
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,167
That's just gonna
cream together.

308
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:17,900
...with triangle shapes.

309
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,967
And for my salsa, I'm thinking

310
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:23,767
of just pureeing some fruit.

311
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:27,567
REESE: I'm pretty lucky
that I already have chips done.

312

All I have to do is just make
a raspberry compote.

313
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,500
About a teaspoon.

314
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,833

get a thicker consistency.

into triangles

AUDRA: To make my chips,

513
00:21:32,967 --> 00:21:35,867
I fry up some pie dough.

514
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,567
And for my salsa,

515
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,567
I take some passion-fruit puree

516
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:43,200
and add some red
food dye to it.

517
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,400
Super red. Nice.

518
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,467
Then I add
some mini marshmallows

519
00:21:48,467 --> 00:21:52,300
to act as kind of, like, onions.

520
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,233
As my water's boiling
with my beans inside,

521
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:58,133
I'm going to start
on my chocolate ganache.

522
00:21:58,133 --> 00:21:59,400
I heat up my heavy cream

523
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,167
and then pour it
right over the chocolate

524
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:02,500
and start to stir.

525
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:05,433

I want to make this Dessert
Imposter extra special.

528
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:11,400
So I decided to put a side dish.

529
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,833
For my mashed potatoes,
I make a buttercream

530
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,433
with seeds from a vanilla bean
and a half a banana.

531
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:20,200
I'm adding sea-salt flakes
to this

532
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,567
because it's a really
sweet frosting.

533
00:22:22,567 --> 00:22:25,633
So it'll give a nice
sweet-and-salty taste.

534
00:22:25,633 --> 00:22:28,433
I'm also gonna add
some green beans.

535
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:30,900
Okay.
I grab green candy melts

536
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,167
and glucose syrup.

537
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,733

in a food processor

I roll out some brownie
into the shape of meatballs,

Boy, it's really good.
It's not too sweet.

676
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:27,833
-Yeah.
-It just really looks

677
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:29,233
like a meatball sub.

678
00:28:29,233 --> 00:28:31,567
And it tastes
really good, too.

679
00:28:31,567 --> 00:28:33,067
-Yeah.
-Thank you, Aidan. Good job.

680
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:34,567
-Bye.
-Great job.

681
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:36,600
Dude, that looks
like a sandwich.

682
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,633
Best looking so far.

683
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,800
Hi, Reese!

684
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,933
My chili is made out
of a chocolate ganache

685
00:28:42,933 --> 00:28:47,067
with boiled almonds and cake.

686
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:49,833
The salsa is
a raspberry compote

687
00:28:49,833 --> 00:28:51,067
with phyllo chips.

688
00:28:51,067 --> 00:28:53,433
Your raspberry salsa,

689
00:28:53,433 --> 00:28:56,600
it's tangy in the right places,
sweet in the right places.

690
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,133
-Well done.
-Thank you.

691
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,700
But you would have made
a much more convincing chip

692
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,500
if the phyllo dough was thicker.
Okay.

693
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,367
-You know what I love?
-What do you love, Duff?

694
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:07,433
I love that as soon
as I saw this plate,

695
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,200
I was just like,
"I don't know who made that.

696
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,100
But whoever it was,
they got chili."

697
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,067
Good job.

698
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:17,067
Not a big fan
of the nuts being boiled.

699
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,700
-Okay.
-I think using the nuts

700
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,467
was a really good idea visually.
Okay.

701
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,733
I don't know if it was
a good idea taste-wise.

702
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:25,467
All right, Reese.
Thank you so much.

703
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:27,900

Keili.

705
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,067
So, it's a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

706
00:29:32,067 --> 00:29:34,833
The bread is white cake.

707
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:38,400
The jelly is purple buttercream.

708
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,333
The salsa is chocolate melt.

709
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:45,233
And the chips are cake
coated in cinnamon and sugar.

710
00:29:45,233 --> 00:29:47,167
Keili, uh, you basically
made a doughnut.

711
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:48,667
There's, like,
the cinnamon, the sugar.

712
00:29:48,667 --> 00:29:49,867
It's fried. It's greasy.

713
00:29:49,867 --> 00:29:51,533
-Okay.
-It's delicious.

714
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:54,633
I would have hoped that you did
a little bit more with the salsa

715
00:29:54,633 --> 00:29:56,100
'cause when
I think of salsa,

716
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,667
I think it's got
some liquid in there

717
00:29:57,667 --> 00:30:00,500
to put your tortilla
chip in there and soften it.

718
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:04,533
Okay. I got some issues.
I mean, you never make

719
00:30:04,533 --> 00:30:07,167
a peanut butter and jelly
sandwich with the heel.

720
00:30:07,167 --> 00:30:08,833
Here's the deal.

721
00:30:08,833 --> 00:30:11,633
The weird thing about this
is it doesn't really look like

722
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:13,233
a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich.

723
00:30:13,233 --> 00:30:16,033
-But it tastes like one.
-Is that good or bad?

It's always good
to confuse people.

-Thank you.

Hey, Cole.

728
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:27,567
I'm really hoping
that this meatloaf imposter

729
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:30,300
will bring me
to the top, if not win.

730
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,333
So, for the meatloaf part,

731
00:30:32,333 --> 00:30:35,133
it's chocolate cake
infused with coffee

732
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:38,800
with a pecan topping
for, like, meat texture.

733
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,633
And the mashed potatoes
are a banana buttercream

734
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:45,500
with a candy melt
butter square.

735
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,100
Tell me about
your chips and salsa.

736
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,033
For the chips,
it's deep-fried puff pastry

737
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:51,800
tossed in cinnamon sugar.

738
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:56,400
And the salsa is mango
and pineapple and lime.

739
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,033
I got to tell you,
that's --

740

It's incredibly
impressive looking.

00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:03,833
I have one little
question, though.

-Mm-hmm.
-Why is it sparkling?

744
00:31:06,233 --> 00:31:07,767

everything better.

takes me away from it.

-Okay.
-But, like,

is amazing looking.

-Thank you.
-This is amazing.

751
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,300
-It really looks like meatloaf.
-Your mashed potatoes

-Mmm.
-The cake's real nice.

I mean, it's getting
a good, deep chocolate flavor.

756
00:31:29,567 --> 00:31:31,833
I think you used
the coffee right.

757
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,600
Now, this is interesting.
It is like a fruit salad.

758
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,400
But, yet, this looks a little
bit more like salsa...

-Mm-hmm.
-...except for the glitter.

of glitter in there.

I have made
a grilled cheese sandwich.

The bread is a almond cake.

767

The cheese is a almond paste
dyed yellow.

768
00:31:58,233 --> 00:32:03,667
The salsa, I have
blood-orange puree with coconut

769

and a little bit
of cake crumbs on top.

770

-Phyllo dough...

it looks like salsa.

just like a grilled cheese.

thick one, too.

850
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,067
Dude, this chicken
looks amazing.

851
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,700
It is.
It looks like a chicken leg.

852
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,200
Let's slice into this.

853
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,133
[ Laughing ]
What are you doing?

854
00:35:37,133 --> 00:35:38,900
Got a chicken leg.

855
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,900
I'm excited about it.

856
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:44,300
-Mmm!
-Mmm.

857
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,333
This cake is so moist.

858
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,933
The lemon
is not overpowering.

859
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:49,933
It's a very subtle
lemon flavor.

860
00:35:49,933 --> 00:35:51,233
With the jam on top

861
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:52,800
and then
the graham crackers,

862
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,867
it all kind of goes together
and looks like a chicken leg.

863
00:35:55,867 --> 00:35:58,967
-Spot on, man.
-Thank you.

864
00:35:58,967 --> 00:36:00,300
Hey, Dylin.

865
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,867
My Dessert Imposter
was a hot dog.

866
00:36:02,867 --> 00:36:04,700
I made a classic vanilla cake.

867
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,867
And I made that
into the hot dog bun.

868
00:36:06,867 --> 00:36:09,933
And for my hot dog,
I put pink buttercream.

869
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:11,467
And I know Duff hates it,

870
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:14,467
but ketchup is red buttercream.

871
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:17,600
I like ketchup on my hot dog,
ketchup and mustard.

872
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,767
-Ketchup and mustard.
-We used to be friends.

873
00:36:19,767 --> 00:36:22,100
-[ Laughs ]
-Tell me about your salsa.

874
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:26,467
My salsa is diced
sweet cherries, apples,

875
00:36:26,467 --> 00:36:28,100
and then I added
a little bit of red dye

876
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,333
so it would be a dark red.

877
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:31,800
And that is my chipotle sauce.

878
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,167
And then for my chips,

879
00:36:33,167 --> 00:36:36,633
they are triangular-shaped
phyllo dough.

880
00:36:36,633 --> 00:36:39,300
Huh. Okay.

881
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,500
Mmm.
I like the cherries.

882
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,967
I think
we could've backed off

883
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:44,133
on the red dye
just a little bit.

884
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:45,833
I think if this color
would have been

885
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:49,133
a little bit different
and the chips a little firmer,

886
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:50,667
you would've knocked it
out of the park.

887
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:52,633
All right. Well,
let's get into your hot dog.

888
00:36:52,633 --> 00:36:54,767
I've been watching you bake
for a couple of weeks now.

889
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:57,767
And I think that you're a lot
more creative than this.

890
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,867
I think that you could've done
a little bit more,

891
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:02,600
because, right now,
I got cake and buttercream.

892
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,667
And that's it.

893
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:05,667
Your bun kind of looks like

894
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,400
you just sort of
tore it off the cake

895
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,067
and relatively quickly
kind of mashed it into shape.

896
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,500
I'm wondering how long you
left your cake in the oven.

897
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:17,433
It could've used a good
extra 10 minutes.

898
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:19,367
Yeah.
It's a little under-baked.

899
00:37:19,367 --> 00:37:23,067
Although...that's some
tasty buttercream.

900
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,233
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Dylin.

901
00:37:24,233 --> 00:37:26,300
-Thank you so much, man.
-Thank you.

902
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,067
I just wanted
a little more.

903
00:37:33,833 --> 00:37:37,133
Hmm, roast-beef sandwich.
Want to bring in Maya?

904
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:39,667
-Yes, please.
-Hey, Maya.

905
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:42,567
MAYA: Walking into judging,
I'm, like, shivering.

906
00:37:42,567 --> 00:37:44,900
I have butterflies
in my stomach,

907
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,733
a lot of things wrong with me.

908
00:37:46,733 --> 00:37:49,333
**

909
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,833
-Hi, Maya.
-Hi.

910
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:53,800
All right. So, Maya, you got
roast beef sandwich?

911
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,633
-Yes.
-Tell me about it.

912
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:58,067
The bread is white cake.

913
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:00,433
The beef is brownies.

914
00:38:00,433 --> 00:38:04,100
And the lettuce
is coconut flakes dyed green.

915
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,300
And then the tomatoes
are raspberries.

916
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,200
And then for my salsa and chips,

917
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,767
you have crepes

918
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,733
sprinkled in cinnamon sugar,
deep fried.

919
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:15,567
And then for the salsa
you have, um,

920
00:38:15,567 --> 00:38:18,600
coconut flakes dyed
green with cherries.

921
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,667
-The chips are good.
-I think the chips are good.

922
00:38:20,667 --> 00:38:23,833
But they do look like ridged
potato chips, though.

923
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,433
Okay.
So this is your salsa?

924
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:28,067
-Yeah.
-Now, your salsa

925
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,433
looks suspiciously like
the lettuce...

926
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,933
-Mm-hmm.
-...on your sandwich.

927
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:33,933
Did you use the same stuff?

928
00:38:33,933 --> 00:38:35,967
-Yes.
-Why?

929
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:38,067
I didn't really
have enough time.

930
00:38:38,067 --> 00:38:40,700
I'm not real crazy
about the salsa.

931
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,967
Yeah. I think this might be
the weakest part of your plate.

932
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:44,267
Yeah.

933
00:38:44,267 --> 00:38:48,067
This looks
roast beef sandwich-ish.

934
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:49,333
But it looks more like

935
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:50,867
a piece of cake
cut into a pie shape.

936
00:38:50,867 --> 00:38:52,167
Mm-hmm.

937
00:38:52,167 --> 00:38:55,167
This cake is so moist,

938
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:57,333
so yummy,
cooked perfectly.

939
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:58,900
I'm wondering why
you didn't put more brownie in

940
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,867
so you see the roast beef.

941
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:03,967
If I get a roast beef sandwich
like this at the deli,

942
00:39:03,967 --> 00:39:06,067
I'm -- I'm givin' it back,

943
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:08,600
'cause, like, there's not enough
roast beef on here, you know?

944
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,667
Yeah. When you get a roast beef,
it's like 2/3 roast beef,

945
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,500
-1/3 bread.
-Mm-hmm.

946
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,767
Thanks, Maya.

947
00:39:14,767 --> 00:39:17,733
**

948
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,933
Bakers,
today we asked you

949
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:24,167
to create
Dessert Imposters

950
00:39:24,167 --> 00:39:25,767
that looked like
comfort foods

951
00:39:25,767 --> 00:39:27,600
but tasted like dessert.

952
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,500
And there were
three imposters

953
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,067
that were really,
really great.

954
00:39:34,133 --> 00:39:37,967
Aidan, you made
an incredible meatball sub.

955
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:39,233
Not only did it look good,

956
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:41,200
you filled it
with wicked-good brownies.

957
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,967
Thank you.

958
00:39:42,967 --> 00:39:44,500
-Cole.
-Yes!

959
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,867
Your meatloaf and mashed
potatoes were amazing.

960
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:49,533
You hit every detail.

961
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,567
-Excellent work.
-Thank you.

962
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:56,200
Jason, you served
your burrito in aluminum foil

963
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,767
just like
a real burrito.

964
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,533
You actually balanced
the chocolate very well.

965
00:40:00,533 --> 00:40:02,933
-Chocolate.
-[ Laughs ]

966
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:06,433
And your crepe was a really
smart tortilla imposter.

968
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:13,667
Now, one baker's dish
earned a five-star review.

969
00:40:13,667 --> 00:40:16,033
And that baker is...

970
00:40:16,033 --> 00:40:19,133
Please be me.

971
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,967
-...Jason.
-Yay!

972
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,433
Good job, Jason.

973
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:24,667
-You did it.
-Good job, Jason.

974
00:40:24,667 --> 00:40:26,633
Oh, my gosh.

975
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,333
Monster comeback, my man.

976
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:32,100
That is a big leap
from bottom three

977
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:34,033
to the winner
of the challenge.

978
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:35,400
Thank you.

979
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,500
Now, there were
some bakers

980
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:40,133
whose Dessert Imposters
had a few flaws

981
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:43,367
but were good enough
to fool us at first glance.

982
00:40:43,367 --> 00:40:46,433
Those bakers are Justice,

983
00:40:46,433 --> 00:40:48,500
-Kaniyah...
-Yes.

984
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,933
Keili, and...

985
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:53,767
Reese.

986
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:58,133
Unfortunately, that leaves
Audra, Dylin, and Maya.

987
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:01,333
Please step forward.

988
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,733
AUDRA:
No. Not Maya.

989
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:06,467
Audra, your deconstructed
lemon pie

990
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:09,133
macaroni and cheese
was overly sweet

991
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,133
and bitter
at the same time.

992
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:15,333
Made it a little
hard to eat.

993
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:17,967
Dylin,
your hot dog approach

994
00:41:17,967 --> 00:41:20,567
wasn't super creative.

995
00:41:20,567 --> 00:41:22,367
You used buttercream
for the hot dog

996
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,533
and all the condiments.

997
00:41:24,533 --> 00:41:28,467
And your cake bun
was really under-baked.

998
00:41:28,467 --> 00:41:30,300
Maya,
your roast-beef sandwich

999
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,900
didn't really
fool anyone,

1000
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:36,567
especially since it hardly had
any brownie roast beef.

1001
00:41:36,567 --> 00:41:39,067
The baker that will be
going home is...

1002

00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,500

Sorry, man.

1005
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:47,567
You were awesome to watch.

1006
00:41:47,567 --> 00:41:49,533
-Great job.
-We're really gonna miss you.

1007
00:41:49,533 --> 00:41:50,800
Sorry, Dylin.

1008
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,067
DYLIN: There's one thing
I've learned in the kitchen.

1009
00:41:53,067 --> 00:41:55,067
And that's I'm not just any kid.

1010
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:58,133
I'm also a talented
and amazing baker.

00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:33,633
The baker that will be
going home is Dylan.

16
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,700
Wow.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,933
Oh.

18
00:00:43,933 --> 00:00:45,500
Oh, my gosh!

19
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,833
KANIYAH: We are walking
into the kitchen.

20
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:51,033
And we see this '80s stuff.

21
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:53,933
I'm 10 years old.
I was born in 2006.

22
00:00:53,933 --> 00:00:57,333
What is the '80s to me?

23
00:00:57,333 --> 00:01:00,700
Oh! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

24
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,467
'60s clothes!

25
00:01:02,467 --> 00:01:03,733
Hi, bakers.

26
00:01:03,733 --> 00:01:05,700
ALL: Hi!

27
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,600
You're lookin' groovy.

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,967
Groovy.

29
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,567
Bakers,
you're probably wondering

30
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,933
why we're wearing
tie-dye.

31
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,433
Pretty much.

32
00:01:15,433 --> 00:01:19,100
Fact is, colorful cakes
are incredible popular...

33
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,333
Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,900
Especially tie-dye cakes.

35
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:25,233
ALL: Yay!

36
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:27,500
I've made tie-dye
cakes before.

37
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,200
And they look pretty swagger.

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,333
For your big bake,
bakers,

39
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:38,367
you have two hours
to make a tie-dye cake

40
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,300
bursting with color
and...

41
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,567
-Flavor!
-...flavor.

42
00:01:42,567 --> 00:01:44,367
-Flavor!
-Flavor.

43
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:48,067
All right.
And your baking time starts...

44
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:49,167
-now!
-Now!

45
00:01:52,133 --> 00:01:54,467
Glitter,
rainbow glitter.

46
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:58,733
4 ounces is one stick.
6 ounces of butter.

47
00:01:58,733 --> 00:02:00,333
Oh, no.

48
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:02,633
I was one
of the last ones here.

49
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,633
I know the '60s were all
about peace and love.

50
00:02:05,633 --> 00:02:07,267
But right now,
all I'm feeling

51
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:09,833
is the pressure to get
this cake done perfectly.

52
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:11,300
Orange.

53
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,967
I'm making an orange-flavored
tie-dye cake

54
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,633
with an orange buttercream.

55
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:20,400
Audra's got a big bottle
of orange extract over there.

56
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,733
Extract is intense,
only to be used sparingly.

57
00:02:26,867 --> 00:02:30,067
First, I cream together
my butter and shortening.

58
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:36,767
Then I add in my sugar, eggs,
buttermilk, and my whole milk

59
00:02:36,767 --> 00:02:40,600
and combine it
with my orange extract.

60
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,300
Orange extract.

61
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,467
-Wow.
-Eeh!

62
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:45,833
Perfect.

63
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,700
Then I add my flour...

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,233
A little flour mixture

65
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:53,867
...and my milk mixture
to my other wet ingredients.

66
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:55,867
Audra,
how are you doing?

67
00:02:55,867 --> 00:02:57,733
Um, fine.

68
00:02:57,733 --> 00:02:59,433
For today's bake,

69
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,800
I'm gonna make
an apple-cinnamon cake.

70
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,167
There we go.

71
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:06,067
I had never added apples
into my cake before.

72
00:03:06,067 --> 00:03:09,233
I'm not sure if that's gonna
affect the baking time.

73
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,833
But I'm pretty sure
it'll turn out fine

74
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,900
because it'll give it
that flavor that I need.

75
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,233
-Jason.
-Yeah?

76
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:18,200
What type of cake
are you gonna make?

77
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,533
I'm just making, like,
a vanilla cake recipe.

78
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,233
And then for the flavor,
I'm probably gonna make,

79
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,633
like, um, puree
or something.

80
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,200
Oh, cool!

81
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,133
JASON: Last week built
my confidence quite a bit

82
00:03:29,133 --> 00:03:31,967
because I got first place!
Yeah!

83
00:03:31,967 --> 00:03:34,267
Now it's nice and smooth.

84
00:03:34,267 --> 00:03:35,733
Duff and Valerie said

85
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,333
that we have to have
both color and flavor.

86
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,933
I have a good plan for that.

87
00:03:39,933 --> 00:03:42,367
I'm gonna make
a strawberry puree

88
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:45,600
and add that into my batter.

89
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,367
Mmm.
This is gonna be delicious.

90
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:50,333
Baking a tie-dyed cake

91
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:54,067
is pretty much the same thing
as baking a regular cake.

92
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:57,500
I divide the batter
into three bowls.

93
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,167
I dye the first one red
with the strawberry puree,

94
00:04:01,167 --> 00:04:04,267
the middle one blue,
and the last one green

95
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:07,100
and layer the different colors
on top of each other.

96
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,300
I get a toothpick
and start spreading

97
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,667
out the colors
just a little bit

98
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:15,533
and just bake it
like a normal cake.

99
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,700
-Hi, Kaniyah!
-Hello.

100
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,500
I see you're separating
your batters already.
Yeah.

101
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,433
What flavor of cake
are you making?

102
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,133
I am making
a vanilla cake.

103
00:04:24,133 --> 00:04:26,600
Have you made
a tie-dyed cake before?

104
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,733
I have not.
But I know what they look like.

105
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:30,333
I have seen many people

106
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,700
make tie-dye cakes
on the Internet.

107
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,400
So let's see
how this turns out.

108
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,733
Have at it.
Have fun.

109
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,067
Thank you.

110
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:43,467
I like me cake.
And I like me colors.

111
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:49,900
Roy G. Biv,
which means red, orange, yellow,

112
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:54,733
green, blue, indigo, and violet.

113
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,267
VALERIE: We're looking
for a tie-dye cake

114
00:04:59,267 --> 00:05:01,267
bursting with color

115
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:04,767
sort of like Duff's shirt,
lots of color.

116
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:06,267
That it is.

117
00:05:06,267 --> 00:05:08,867
I do like Duff's shirt.
It's really, really neon.

118
00:05:08,867 --> 00:05:10,567
I don't know what happened
to all the hippies.

119
00:05:10,567 --> 00:05:15,067
But I'm pretty sure it just,
like, it got outta style.

120
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,600
Does anybody have
the cake flour?

121
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,167
AIDAN: I have cake flour.
I just got it.

122
00:05:20,167 --> 00:05:21,300
Can I use it?

123
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,267
Yes. Yeah.
Take it.

124
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:26,533
REESE: I am making a tie-dye
yellow-and-white cake

125
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:28,467
with an American buttercream.

126
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:32,267
My inspiration
comes from a tie-dye shirt

127
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:36,100
that I made
for my fourth-grade graduation.

128
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,700
Reese,
what you making?

129
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:41,967
I'm making a white cake
right now.

130
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,600
You haven't made
your cake batter yet?

131
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,867
I have.
I made a yellow cake.

132
00:05:46,867 --> 00:05:50,100
Oh, okay. So you're making
two different kinds of batter?
Yeah.

133
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,500
Okay. All right.
All right.

134
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,267
I'm making two
different batters

135
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:56,533
because I think that'll
impress the judges.

136
00:05:56,533 --> 00:05:57,733
Is anything
in the oven yet?

137
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:58,900
Not yet.

138
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,700
Okay.
Are you worried about that?

139
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:01,867
No.

140
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:04,367
No? I am.

141
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:05,867
Good luck, man.
[ Chuckles ]

142
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,333
Thank you.

143
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,467
This looks really good.
I'm, like, so excited.

144
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:13,067
I am making a vanilla
tie-dye cake

145
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,267
with a vanilla buttercream.

146
00:06:14,267 --> 00:06:15,467
In the first challenge,

147
00:06:15,467 --> 00:06:17,567
the judges loved
my tie-dye cakes.

148
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,067
So I'm just gonna stick
with the same recipe.

149
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:22,467
Love this color.

150
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:24,133
When the judges
eat this cake,

151
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,233
I want them to feel like
they're on a unicorn

152
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:29,500
jumping over a rainbow.

153
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,967
I'm using one cake pan
instead of two

154
00:06:31,967 --> 00:06:34,633
because I don't have enough.

155
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,100
I'm a little nervous.

156
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,633
But I'm just gonna go with it.

157
00:06:38,633 --> 00:06:41,067
Please bake.

158
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,300
Does anybody have
food coloring I can use?

159
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,400
Oh, food coloring?
Yeah.

160
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,633
I'm about to get
to the coloring stage.

161
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:50,800
I like to bake
with a lot of colors at home,

162
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,233
just, like, with my signature
"crayon-melt cake."

163
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:56,567
I took a fondant cake

164
00:06:56,567 --> 00:06:59,200
and dripped food coloring
down the sides.

165
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,367
That's good.

166
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,733
I'm making a tie-dye cake

167
00:07:03,733 --> 00:07:05,200
Mm, delicious.

168
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:12,233
...with strawberry,
orange, lemon, and lime.

169
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,867
When they take a bite,
with each flavor,

170
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:16,600
I think it's gonna really pop.

171
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,767
Gosh, I need to get these
in the oven stat.

172
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:22,067
Blue.

173
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,867
Today, I'm making
tie-dye white cakes

174
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,933
with some airbrush fondant.

175
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,467
This is the perfect
challenge for me

176
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:31,067
because I love
making cakes.

177
00:07:31,067 --> 00:07:32,767
Groovy, man.

178
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,700
I'm making
a vanilla-strawberry cake

179
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:40,667
because I think those flavors
go really good with tie-dye.

180
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,767
I've never used
strawberry powder in a cake.

181
00:07:42,767 --> 00:07:45,067
And I've never used it
at all in baking.

182
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,967
But I hope that this will work.

183
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,333
I'm looking around,

184
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,267
and everyone else has
their cakes in the oven.

185
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:53,933
I'm thinking,
"Why am I so slow?"

186
00:07:53,933 --> 00:07:56,067
Can we have
your attention, bakers?

187
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,067
Oh, no.

188
00:07:58,067 --> 00:08:00,267
What is going on?

189
00:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,300
You guys in the mood
for a little twist?

190
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,333
-No.
-No!

191
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,900
Tie-dye is so colorful

Whoa.
What are you doing?

368
00:16:09,267 --> 00:16:10,867
-Fondant.
-Oh, fondant.

369
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:12,233
I'm using fondant because

370
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:16,333
I wanna airbrush
on a smooth, clean surface.

371
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,667
When you're working
with fondant,

372
00:16:17,667 --> 00:16:19,433
you have to brush it
with powdered sugar,

373
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,633
otherwise it'll stick
to your surface.

374
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,333
Now, I'm gonna roll it up
on a French rolling pin

375
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:27,700
and drape it over the cake.

376
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:32,367
I've never airbrushed
a tie-dye design before,

377
00:16:32,367 --> 00:16:34,067
so I'm gonna take a toothpick

378
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:36,233
and indent the spiral design

379
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:40,833
and go beside those lines
with the airbrush.

380
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,067
That looks spectacular.

381
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,867
Thank you.

382
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:46,833
All right.
Time to check.

383
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:50,533
I take my cakes out,
and I can really smell the lime

384
00:16:50,533 --> 00:16:53,133
and the strawberry
and orange and the lemon,

385
00:16:53,133 --> 00:16:55,767
which is great
because I know Duff

386
00:16:55,767 --> 00:16:57,633
and Valerie will love it.

387
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:59,400
I get it on a turntable.

388
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,167
And I apply a frosting.

389
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,900
All right.
Making a ganache.

390
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,600
I separate the ganache
into individual deli cups,

391
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,167
so I can dye them.

392
00:17:09,167 --> 00:17:10,467
That's good.

393
00:17:10,467 --> 00:17:12,700
I start pouring it on my cake.

394
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:14,933
It doesn't completely
cover the whole thing.

395
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:19,067
But it's still fun and messy,
just like real tie-dye.

398
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,500
Okay.
I just hope, like,

399
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,533
the clock doesn't
get me this time.

400
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,333
Yeah.

401
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,567
To decorate my cake,

402
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,100
I'm gonna put
a layer of fondant.

403
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:35,167
And then I'm gonna
use the airbrush

404
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:36,867
and put some colors on there.

405
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:40,900
You need to be super colorful
for this challenge.

406
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,900
I put my fondant in the sheeter,

407
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,967
which will basically
flatten it out in even layer.

408
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:48,767
So there won't be
any inconsistencies

409
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:49,867
with my cake.

Look, Jason's using
the sheeter for his fondant.

412
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,667
I think he's the first
one so far.
Mm-hmm.

413
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:59,800
Can I use that to make
giant lasagna noodles?

414

For my buttercream,

430
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,600
I start by mixing
together powdered sugar,

431
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:54,133
softened butter,
milk, and vanilla.

432
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,300
I whip it until
it's nice and creamy

433
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,833
to make the cake
have an extra pop

434
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:01,633
of nice tie-dye color.

435
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,067
So I color part
of the buttercream yellow

436
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:05,967
and the other part pink.

437
00:19:05,967 --> 00:19:10,233
It's ugly right now,
but it'll look better soon.

438
00:19:10,233 --> 00:19:12,067
I put the pink buttercream on,

439
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,767

It was still warm

on warm toast.

You're like, "Oh,
that's kind of pleasant."

in to high gear

-I do, too.

718
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,367
Let's taste it.

719
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,067
It's a little bit raw
in the middle.

720
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:51,867
The edges
got a little dry.

721
00:30:51,867 --> 00:30:53,100
The flavors
are really good.

722
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,533
It's not terrible at all.

723
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,833
Mnh-mnh.

724
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:58,033
Beautiful colors.

725
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,200
Gorgeous colors.

726
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,567
I think you got
a good ice cream.

727
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:03,900
It's delicious.
There's a swirl on top.

728
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,767
I can see it.
I can't really taste it.

729
00:31:05,767 --> 00:31:07,300
Overall, not a bad job.

730
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:09,333
-Thank you.
-Thanks, Kaniyah.

731
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:13,067
Puppy-dog eyes.
Don't send me home.

732
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,300
Justice, tell me
what you made.

733
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:21,333
I made a strawberry-vanilla
tie-dye cake.

734
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:24,167
My ice cream is
a vanilla ice cream

735
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:26,667
with a raspberry swirl.

736
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:30,600
I really love the way
you gave your cake a fade.

737
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,667
It goes from pink,
salmon-y to the orange.

738
00:31:33,667 --> 00:31:35,167
Yeah, it's kind of ombre.

739
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,467
-Ombre, yeah, yeah.

740
00:31:36,467 --> 00:31:38,300
-A fade is a haircut.
-Oh, sorry.

741
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:41,900
'Cause I know so much
about haircuts, obviously.

742
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,167
[ Both laugh ]

743
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,433
Well, I wanna see
the inside of it.

744
00:31:44,433 --> 00:31:47,967
-Let's cut her open.
-Let's see it.

745
00:31:47,967 --> 00:31:49,500
All right.
Thanks, man.

746
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,600
Will you look at all those
fabulous colors in there.

747
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,600
Yeah.

748
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,333
Mm! Super moist!

749
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,467
Definitely getting strawberry,
like you said.

750
00:31:57,467 --> 00:32:00,100
-That is so moist.
-So yummy.

751
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,067
-Perfect.
-Thank you.

752
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:03,300
I got -- That's a --

753
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,533
I got some swirls!

754
00:32:04,533 --> 00:32:07,067
You got a nice swirl.
Look at yours.

755
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,067
The ice cream's
really good, creamy...

756
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,800
-Thank you.
-...not overly spun.

757
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,567
I don't get a lot of flavor
in the swirl.

758
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:15,200
It's delicious.
It's really good.

759
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,267
But I'm not --
I'm not tasting that raspberry.

760
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:20,500
And I really want to.
Thanks, man.

761
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,067
I think it's time
to call in Maya.

762
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:23,133
-What do you think?
-Let's do it.

763
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:25,400
Hey, Maya.

764
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,567
MAYA: I'm afraid that my cake
is a little short.

765
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:31,800
But I think it looks
like Duff's shirt.

766
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,300
So hopefully, I get
some points for that.

767
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,133
-How's it goin', Maya?
-Good.

768
00:32:36,133 --> 00:32:38,367
Right on.
Tell me about your cake.

769
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:42,267
It is a vanilla cake
with a vanilla buttercream.

770
00:32:42,267 --> 00:32:43,867
And then for the ice cream,

771
00:32:43,867 --> 00:32:48,733
it's vanilla ice cream
with a raspberry puree.

772
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:51,733
Your cake is too short.
We need a little more cake.

773
00:32:51,733 --> 00:32:52,933
You know what?

774
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:54,933
It's short and cute,
just like you.

775
00:32:54,933 --> 00:32:57,567
[ Both laugh ]

776
00:32:57,567 --> 00:33:00,133
I love the sprinkles.

777
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,300
I love how colorful it is.

778
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,067
Thank you, Maya.

779
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:06,733
I do see that there's
some different colors in there.

780
00:33:07,933 --> 00:33:10,933
But I'm loving the cake.

781
00:33:10,933 --> 00:33:13,067
It's really
perfectly moist.

782
00:33:13,067 --> 00:33:15,167
There's just not
enough of it.

783
00:33:15,167 --> 00:33:16,433
Lots of crunching.

784
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:19,067
I think I'm gonna be
crunching on sprinkles

785
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,200
for at least like
six hours.

786
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,667
Because there's that
many sprinkles on it,

787
00:33:23,667 --> 00:33:24,967
it's really sweet.

788
00:33:24,967 --> 00:33:26,100
It's like
a sugar overload.

789
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,400
Okay.

790
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,833
Your ice cream
is really creamy,

791
00:33:30,833 --> 00:33:32,300
not too sweet.

792
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,467
And its got this big bold
burst of raspberry, man.

793
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,400
-Well done.
-Really nice.

794
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,267
That's the best-tasting
swirl so far.

795
00:33:40,267 --> 00:33:41,300
Yep.

796
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:45,867
That's, like,
a huge compliment.

797
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,767
-Hello.
-What's up, Reese?

798
00:33:47,767 --> 00:33:48,967
Nothing.

799
00:33:48,967 --> 00:33:50,667
I'm kind of nervous.

800
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:53,300
As I'm looking at my cake,
I'm like, "Seriously?

801
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:57,333
I could've done
a way better job."

802
00:33:57,333 --> 00:34:00,067
Yeah, looks like you had
kind of a rough day today.

803
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:02,100
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

804
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,667
Please tell me
about your cake.

805
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:07,400
Well, my cake
is a white-and-yellow cake

806
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,600
dyed different colors.

807
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,267
How about your ice cream?
What'd you make?

808
00:34:11,267 --> 00:34:15,600
I did a vanilla ice cream
with a blackberry swirl.

809
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,200
One thing I will say
for your cake --

810
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,667
It's nice and straight.

811
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,200
Your cakes are stacked
up really evenly.

812
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:20,967
And it's sitting flat.

813
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:22,833
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

814
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:26,300
I kind of wanna taste it.
What do you think?
I really wanna taste it.

815
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,467
I cut into the cake,
and I see the inside.

816
00:34:29,467 --> 00:34:33,333
It's a burst of colors,
like a rainbow and Duff's shirt.

817
00:34:33,333 --> 00:34:35,600
Oh, Reese,
this is beautiful.

818
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,567
Look at that cake.

819
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:39,867
-Thank you.
-It's so bright and cheerful.

820
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:41,467
The cakes are really warm.

821
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,400
So the frosting
melted into the cake.

822
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,567
It's good.
It's got a little dense.

823
00:34:46,567 --> 00:34:48,533
You know what?
It needed to be frosted too

824
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:51,233
because the cake
is almost too dry.

825
00:34:51,233 --> 00:34:53,067
I love your buttercream.

826
00:34:53,067 --> 00:34:55,233
Your buttercream
is really tasty.

827
00:34:55,233 --> 00:34:59,067
It's not too, too sweet,
real buttery.

828
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:02,133
It's very good.

829
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:04,100
Ice cream's very tasty,
though.

830
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Again, not overly sweet.

831
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,067
I wish I tasted
more blackberry.

832
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,467
If you're gonna
put a swirl in there,

833
00:35:10,467 --> 00:35:11,767
you wanna be able
to taste the swirl

834
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:13,800
and then taste the ice cream
along with it.

835
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,233
Okay.

836
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:18,067
My cake didn't turn out
as I hoped it to be.

837
00:35:18,067 --> 00:35:20,567
But I hope I do not go home.

838
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,967
Hey, Jason!

839
00:35:24,967 --> 00:35:26,067
Hello!

840
00:35:26,067 --> 00:35:27,533
Hi, Jason.

841
00:35:27,533 --> 00:35:29,967
I see that you're still
in your tie-dyed shirt.

842
00:35:29,967 --> 00:35:32,733
I'm still
in my tie-dye shirt.

843
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:34,300
Tell us what you made today.

844
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,300
I made a tie-dyed cake.

845
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,133
The red part of it
is strawberry.

846
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:43,333
And for my ice cream,

847
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:48,200
the swirl part of it
is a raspberry jelly.

848
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,733
Looking at your cake,

849
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,300
your fondant job
is actually not that bad.

850
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,433
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

851
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:54,633
Thanks, Duff.

852
00:35:54,633 --> 00:35:57,500
That's a real compliment
from a cake expert.

853
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:00,067
I say we cut into it
and let's taste that puppy.

854
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:03,433
Let's eat that thing.

855
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:04,400
Thank you.

856
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,533
Got some interesting
flavors.

857
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:12,200
It's a moist cake
that is falling apart.

858
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
I don't know why
it's falling apart.

859
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,433
The cake is falling apart?

860
00:36:16,433 --> 00:36:18,333
What are you talking about?

861
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:20,233
How did you cool
your cakes?

862
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:21,600
In the blast chiller.

863
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,367
Did you take 'em
out of the pan?

864
00:36:23,367 --> 00:36:26,067
I put the pan
in the blast chiller.

865
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,200
You got to let it cool
a little bit.

866
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,700
Don't take it straight
from the hot oven

867
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,300
and put it straight
into the blast chiller.

868
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:33,133
I think that's why
it's falling apart.

869
00:36:33,133 --> 00:36:36,767
Let's dive into
your ice cream.

870
00:36:36,767 --> 00:36:40,200
Their faces go kind of sour.

871
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,500
Oh, whoo!

872
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
That's a really odd
flavor.

873
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,700
Jason, what --
What is goin' on with you?

874
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,067
I don't know.

875
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:54,833
But a starch-thickened jelly
inside of an ice cream is weird.

876
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:57,267
I thought it tasted fine.

877
00:36:57,267 --> 00:36:59,633
Your ice cream
is delicious.

878
00:36:59,633 --> 00:37:03,767
But lumps of starch
frozen in ice cream...

879
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,067
That makes sense,
scientifically.

880
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,633
I never considered that.

881
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:11,167
Feel like you know
what you're doing.

882
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:13,767
You're just a little
heavy-handed with stuff.

883
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,400
-Thanks.
-Okay.

884
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,733
I didn't do
too well on my cake.

885
00:37:17,733 --> 00:37:18,667
I hate cake.

886
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:21,067
I'm really worried now.

But I don't know.

79
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,667
My ingredients are
whipped cream,

80
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,367
chocolate and cherries.

81
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:18,200
But I'm actually
kind of glad I have that

82
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,100
'cause I can make
something out of that.

83
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,233
But first, I start
my pâte à choux.

84
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:26,267
I quickly add my 2 cups
of bread flour.

85
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:28,167
And I stir that really hard,

86
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,967
really vigorously
and really quick.

87
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:31,667
And the mass forms a ball.

88
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,100
Then I transfer my pâte à choux
to a mixing bowl

89
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,933
because that helps
to get all the steam out.

90
00:03:36,933 --> 00:03:39,633
Put your eggs in when it's hot.
And it cooks the eggs.

91
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:42,700
And you do not want
scrambled pâte à choux.

92
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,567
I add each of my eight eggs
one at a time.

93
00:03:46,567 --> 00:03:50,767
I want my pâte à choux
to be in-between runny and firm.

94
00:03:50,767 --> 00:03:52,633
I first learned
how to make eclairs

95
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:53,933
from a baking book

96
00:03:53,933 --> 00:03:56,067
that I've used
since I was 2.

97
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,667
When I make my eclairs at home,

98
00:03:57,667 --> 00:03:59,733
they normally always
turn out perfectly.

99
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:01,767
And I want them
to turn out like that.

100
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,700
I'm baking to stay
in the competition.

101
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,333
And there's a ton of pressure
riding on my eclairs.

102
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:09,200
Pâte à choux.
Pâte à choux, choux.

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,600
I love pâte à choux.

104
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,333
I'm super excited
because we have 2 hours

105
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:16,467
to take three key components
from old desserts

106
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:18,833
and make them into super new

107
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,900
and creative eclairs.

108
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:23,200
Mix, mix, mix, mix, mix.

109
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,667
I'm making a banana cream
pie eclair.

110
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:28,300
And the three key
components I'm required

111
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,267
to have are bananas,
vanilla custard

112
00:04:31,267 --> 00:04:33,467
and graham-cracker crumbs.

113
00:04:33,467 --> 00:04:35,933
All right, that will ensure
my parchment paper

114
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:38,333
doesn't try to fly anywhere.

115
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,067
I'm so excited
that it's eclairs

116
00:04:40,067 --> 00:04:42,533
because I can do eclairs.
They're easy.

117
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:44,667
And I think it'll be
a lot of fun

118
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,067
to make 'em modernized.

119
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,933
-Wah! Sorry.
-Sorry.

120
00:04:48,933 --> 00:04:51,367
I get German chocolate cake.

121
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,433
That's not my thing.

122
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,967
Ugh.
But I'll try my best.

123
00:04:56,967 --> 00:05:00,267
And the three ingredients
I have to showcase is chocolate,

124
00:05:00,267 --> 00:05:02,267
coconut and pecans.

125
00:05:02,267 --> 00:05:05,067
I'm gonna add just
one egg to my batter.

126
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:08,367
It starts, like,
becoming really liquidy.

127
00:05:08,367 --> 00:05:11,133
I'm just gonna start over
'cause I don't have time to

128
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:12,833
doubt this one.

129
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,667
This is not gonna bake up.
And it's not gonna puff.

130
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,400
So I have to start again.

131
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,533
Maybe I put in too much butter.

132
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:20,933
The most important thing
about pâte à choux

133
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:22,467
is that your measurements
are accurate.

134
00:05:22,467 --> 00:05:25,533
-Correct. Have to be exact.
-They have to be exact.

135
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,200
Now, when you're
adding the eggs...

136
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,433
Say you have a recipe
that calls for eight eggs.

137
00:05:29,433 --> 00:05:31,267
Sometimes, it might
take seven eggs.

138
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:32,967
Because you don't know
the size of the eggs.

139
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,100
Eggs are so many
different sizes.

140
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,367
Eggs are different sizes.

141
00:05:35,367 --> 00:05:37,867
But also just how much
humidity is in the air.

142
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:40,567
-What elevation you live at.
-What elevation you live at.

143
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,300
Uh-oh.

144
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,200
We squashed an egg.

145
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,067
For my throwback dessert,
I got cherry cheesecake.

146
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:52,267
My three elements
are graham-cracker crumbs,

147
00:05:52,267 --> 00:05:56,300
cherries and cream cheese.
I love cheesecake.

148
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,500
So I'm gonna make the best
cheesecake eclair ever.

149
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,567
Last week, I was in the bottom.

150
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,533
Never again.

151
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:06,600
KANIYAH: I am making a regular
pâte à choux dough,

152
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,167
a cherry puree
to put on top of it

153
00:06:09,167 --> 00:06:12,100
and a cherry cream-cheese
filling

154
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,467
with the graham-cracker crumbs
on top.

155
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,633
For my cream-cheese filling,

156
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:21,767
I am using cream cheese,
cherries and that's it.

157
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:25,667
I think the cherries
gave it enough sweetness.

158
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:28,300
I didn't add
any powdered sugar.

159
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,500
VALERIE:
90 minutes left, bakers.

160
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,267
90 minutes.
-Gosh, no.

161
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:35,167
DUFF:
Throwback Dessert Eclairs.

162
00:06:35,167 --> 00:06:38,100
We want perfectly
baked eclairs

163
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,433
if you want to be
stayin' alive.

164
00:06:44,167 --> 00:06:46,400
This is gonna be
my time to shine.

165
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,133
AUDRA:
For my throwback dessert,

166
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:49,900
I have chocolate pecan pie.

167
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:53,233
And I am so happy.

168
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,100
The three key ingredients

169
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,900
I have to use are chocolate,

170
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,633
pecans and brown sugar.

171
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:04,233
I'm making a regular
pâte à choux dough filled

172
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:07,433
with a pecan chocolate mousse

173
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:12,400
and topped
with a brown-sugar pecan glaze.

174
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,533
Egg wash. It's to make them
shiny and pretty.

175
00:07:16,533 --> 00:07:18,867
I've been baking
since I was 5.

176
00:07:18,867 --> 00:07:22,667
And if I win, I'm gonna buy
my cat a ton of cat toys.

177
00:07:22,667 --> 00:07:25,800
That's in the oven.

178
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,967
How are your eclairs doing?

179
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:29,100
AUDRA: Good.

180
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,233
I'm making
a throwback apple-pie eclair

181
00:07:32,233 --> 00:07:36,067
with cinnamon,
apples and nutmeg.

182
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:38,767
I'm just making
cinnamon filling

183
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:42,533
and maybe bake some apples
and kind of lay those on top.

184
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:46,633
Time to start working
on my pastry cream.

185
00:07:46,633 --> 00:07:50,633
I put milk and heavy cream
into the pan and warm it up.

186
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,700
Just cinnamon alone
won't add enough flavor.

187
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,067
So I add some vanilla extract
to my pastry cream.

188
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,267
Okay.

189
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:58,733
That's nice and warm.

190
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,900
I grab my eggs and sugar,

191
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,333
mix those up in a pan

192
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:05,267
and pour the milk into the eggs.

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,367
Come on.

194
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,867
Get out of there.
There you go.

195
00:08:10,867 --> 00:08:13,833
My throwback dessert
is coconut cream pie.

196
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:16,433
And the key ingredients
are vanilla custard,

197
00:08:16,433 --> 00:08:18,800
coconut, and whipped cream.

198
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
Okay.
Last week, I won.

199
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,567
And I feel really great.

200
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:24,200
So coming into this week,
I want to win again.

201
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,500
But I'm not really excited
about this challenge

202
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,567
because I don't like eclairs.

203
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:31,333
It's not working.

204
00:08:34,267 --> 00:08:38,400
My batter is way too liquidy.
I know it's not right.

205
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:42,500
And I have to start over.
-What's going on with Cole?

206
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,333
-He just threw out
his pâte à choux.

207
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:47,167
Hopefully, it'll work this time.

208
00:08:47,167 --> 00:08:49,067
I'm freaking out.

209
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,067
Most time, this thing's
thickened up in a --

210
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,567
in an instant.
But...

211
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,300
JASON: I've been whisking
for a long time.

212
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,700
But this pastry cream
is not thickening up.

213
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,567
How thick?

214
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:05,300
How thick? How thick?
How thick?

215
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,667
I get my pastry cream
into a glass bowl.

216
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:09,467
Cinnamon pastry cream.

217
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:11,467
I throw that into
the blast chiller.

218
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,233
I really hope it'll be okay.

219
00:09:13,233 --> 00:09:15,200
What were your
favorite '70s shows?

220
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,967
Do not say,
"One Day at a Time."

221
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:19,233
Uh, I've -- I --

222
00:09:19,233 --> 00:09:20,767
I'm telling --
I was a huge fan.

223
00:09:20,767 --> 00:09:22,200
You know, it's weird.

224
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,800
We're leaning on a TV
talking about TV on TV.

225
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,800
[ Laughs ]

226
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,567
Kind of looks like there's
a blizzard on the TV.

227
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:34,733
What's that?

228
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,700
It's pretty cool how I got
pineapple upside-down cake

229
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:43,133
'cause my sister actually made
a pineapple upside-down cake

230
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,467
about a month ago.

231
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:49,533
I think I'm gonna use
the cherries and the pineapple

232
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:52,067
and probably the brown sugar
in my pastry cream.

233
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:53,633
I've never cut
a pineapple before.

234
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:56,733
But I've seen my grandma
cut many pineapples before.

235
00:09:56,733 --> 00:09:58,333
I'm chopping up
my pineapple first,

236
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,467
so I don't have
to worry about it later.

237
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,433
This is not working.

238
00:10:04,433 --> 00:10:06,567
Maya, are yours
in the oven yet?

239
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:07,900
No.

240
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,833
My second pâte à choux dough
turns into,

241
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:10,967
like, potato soup.

242
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:13,533
What the heck?

243
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:16,333
I'm really worried.
This is terrible.

244
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,733
I don't have time for this.
[ Sighs ]

245
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,733
[ Crying ] I put my flour.
And it -- it melted.

246
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,233
VALERIE: What's up?
What's up? What's up?

247
00:10:35,233 --> 00:10:37,767
My pâte à choux
is not working.

248
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:40,600
Look at me. Take a deep breath.
Okay. You can do this.

249
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:44,467
When you add your flour,
turn the heat off.

250
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:46,567
And look at those ingredients.
And make sure they're exact.

251
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:47,767
Okay.

252
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:50,667
I need magical unicorn powers
or something

253
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,367
for this German
chocolate cake eclair.

254
00:10:53,367 --> 00:10:55,533
-Okay.
-Hey, bakers.

255
00:10:55,533 --> 00:10:57,533
Can we have
your attention, please?

256
00:10:57,533 --> 00:10:59,000
Oh. Hi.

257
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,967
Hi.

258
00:11:01,967 --> 00:11:03,400
What do you
want me to do now?

259
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,733
What do they have now?

260
00:11:04,733 --> 00:11:06,733
Back in the '70s,
we didn't have as many

261
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,600
healthy lunch snack options.

262
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,400
The only healthy treats
in our lunch boxes

263
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,300
was stuff like raisins,
dried apricots.

264
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:21,100
And if your grandma
made your lunch, prunes.

265
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,067
You guys are so mean.

266
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:26,300
Come on up.
Grab a lunch box.

267
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,133
And then incorporate
the dried fruit inside

268
00:11:29,133 --> 00:11:31,667
into your eclairs.

269
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,067
-What would my cat pick?
-You guys are so nice.

270
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,600
Aren't we?

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,100
I've already gone
through two pâte à chouxs.

272
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,300
Don't need whatever's
in that lunch box.

273
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,067
One hour left, bakers.

274
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:47,067
Throwback dessert eclairs
with dried fruit.

275
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:50,333
Come on.
Please, be nice.

276
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:53,700
COLE: In my lunch box,
I got dried cranberries.

277
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:56,200
Ew.

278
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,433
-Oh, no.
-Raisins. Dang it.

279
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:02,467
Thank you for the apricots!

280
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:06,267
-You're welcome!
-Cranberry!

281
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,967
Aidan. What'd you get
in your lunch box?

282
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:09,200
I got dates.

283
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,733
Aidan.
I got dates too.

284
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:13,067
Aw. Aren't they so bad?

285
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,133
What'd you got?
-I got raisins.

286
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:17,167
-Aw.
-So I might do raisin eclairs!

287
00:12:17,167 --> 00:12:19,367
Since I haven't
finished my batter,

288
00:12:19,367 --> 00:12:21,667
I can add my twist
to my batter

289
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,400
for my pineapple
upside-down eclairs.

290
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,600
Perfect.

291
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,133
I got dried apricots.
I'm so happy.

292
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,400
I go-- I got dates.
They're horrible.

293
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:32,133
JUSTICE:
Now that I have my apricots,

294
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:34,167
I'm going to rehydrate 'em,

295
00:12:34,167 --> 00:12:35,367
put 'em in a food processor

296
00:12:35,367 --> 00:12:36,600
until they're like a paste

297
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,733
and then put that
into my ganache.

298
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:43,167
Do apricots go
with Black Forest cake?

299
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:44,800
I don't know.

300
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,100
Do they?
-Mm.

301
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,767
Did you have a
"One Day at a Time" lunch box?

302
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:51,700
I did not have a
"One Day at a Time" lunch box.

303
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,400
-That's just wrong.
-That's -- that's just wrong.

304
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,067
If anybody out there has a
"One Day at a Time" lunch box,

305
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,467
please send...
-Please send me one.

306
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,433
Send it to Valerie Bertinelli
care of Food Network.

307
00:12:59,433 --> 00:13:03,100
This is like the only way
I can do dates.

308
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,333
No.

309
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,400
I decide to get
something a bit tart

310
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,067
to help balance it out.

311
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,633
Strawberry.

312
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:14,867
Dates are equal
combo of sweet

313
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:19,400
and complete nastiness.

314
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,500
Just throw my bananas
in there too.

315
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,767
If I didn't have to use
these darn dates,

316
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:25,900
then I wouldn't have
to use strawberry.

317
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:30,167
And it would be a delicious,
sweet banana-y vanilla custard.

318
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:32,433
But, no. We can't have that!

319
00:13:32,433 --> 00:13:35,800
Oh, gross.

320
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:40,233
I got some dried apricots.

321
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:43,467
And I'm turning them
into a compote.

322
00:13:43,467 --> 00:13:45,333
And this is gonna be
kind of like a drizzle.

323
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,267
To make my apricot compote

324
00:13:47,267 --> 00:13:49,733
for my apple-pie
throwback eclair,

325
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:52,367
I'm going to grind up
my apricots...

326
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,567
1/3 cup.

327
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,233
And then add a little bit
of apple pectin.

328
00:13:56,233 --> 00:13:58,067
The apple pectin
will thicken it up.

329
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,100
So for when I put it
on the eclair,

330
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:03,467
it won't just fall apart
and fall off.

331
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,333
That is surprisingly good.

332
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:07,967
How's everyone doing?
-Good.

333
00:14:07,967 --> 00:14:11,833
A good eclair has to be
golden brown, has to be risen.

334
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,700
And it has to be hollow enough
for you to fill it.

335
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,067
It's raw.

336
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:17,700
So I put 'em back in the oven

337
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,867
and hope they do not burn.

338
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:22,133
I got raisins.

339
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,067
I'm going to put some
inside of the filling.

340
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:28,400
And I'm going to put a little
bit on top of the eclairs.

341
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,067
I strained the cherries
for the filling.

342
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:35,533
Hmm. I'm going
to use this juice.

343
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,333
And I add powdered sugar
to thicken it up

344
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,567
for like a sauce
to go on the top

345
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,433
for my
cherry cheesecake eclairs.

346
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:44,800
All planned out.

347
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,067
AUDRA: No idea how I'm
incorporating my cranberries.

348
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,067
Put it in the filling.

349
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:55,600
Actually, I think pecan pie
would go with cranberries.

350
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,167
To make my mousse,

351
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,967
I add my chocolate
and my cocoa powder

352
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,867
and mix that together.

353
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,800
I add pecans to my mousse

354
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,267
and take all of my whipped cream

355
00:15:06,267 --> 00:15:09,133
and fold my chocolate into that.

356
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:12,067
You will not fail.

357
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,133
What's going on
with Cole?

358
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,800
COLE:
I'm still making pâte à choux.

359
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,233
I need to hurry up.

360
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,167
DUFF:
Just waiting for that to boil?

361
00:15:21,167 --> 00:15:25,433
Uh, do you have all your
other elements done, filling?

362
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,300
Filling's trying to thicken.

363
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,600
What are you making?

364
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,767
Coconut vanilla filling,
like a pie filling.

365
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:33,233
Okay.

366
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,800
There's a lot
of pressure in this challenge

367
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,433
because if I don't make a good
coconut cream pie eclair,

368
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:43,067
$25,000 just, like, goes away.

369
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,800
45 minutes, bakers.

370
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:47,667
45 minutes.

371
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:49,800
Wow. Cole just gave us
the stink eye.

372
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:53,867
Mm-hmm. He is not
a happy camper today.

373
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,567
Cole, how do you
really feel?

374
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,533
[ Laughter ]

375
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:00,900
Really liquidy.

376
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,533
I'm really frustrated
right now

377
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,967
because my pâte à choux dough
is not coming together.

378
00:16:05,967 --> 00:16:08,933
This is not good.

And I'm on my third
pâte à choux dough.

381
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,700
I just have to go with it
'cause I have no time.

382
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,300
Okay, Maya Jindal,
you better get this together.

383
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,300
Hopefully this works out.

in the oven yet?

-Yeah.
-Nice. My egg wash.

VALERIE: Reese is having
a little trouble

387
00:16:30,933 --> 00:16:32,600
with time management again.

388
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,567
He has time management
problems every week.

And every week, he pulls it out.
-He does.

Okay.
I'll give him that.

391

pâte à choux dough.

I am so lucky this worked.

393
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:46,700
Now that my eclairs
are in the oven,

00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,133
I'm going to start
on my pastry cream.

-Reese, what you up to?
-Pastry cream.

396
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,433
Pastry cream.

397
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:53,667
-Reese.
-Yeah?

398
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,733
-Can I use your cherries?
-Cherries, yes, yes.

Don't take all of them
-All right. Thank you.

-You're welcome.

401
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,667
For my whipped cream,
I have some cream,

402
00:17:00,667 --> 00:17:03,600
some chocolate
and some powdered sugar

403
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,167
and some cherries
that I combined all together

404
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:09,633
to make a nice chocolate-cherry
whipped cream.

405
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:10,767
I pull my eclairs out.

406
00:17:10,767 --> 00:17:12,567
And I poke each of them
with a toothpick,

407
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,300
so the steam gets out
of my eclairs.

408
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,067
And it's not all gooey.

409
00:17:16,067 --> 00:17:17,833
Your eclairs look so good.

410
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,200

00:25:32,767 --> 00:25:34,167
JUSTICE:
I'm feeling pretty excited

598
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,900
because my eclairs
turned out really well.

599
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,200
But I want to see what
the judges have to say.

600
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,100
Confident walk.
Feeling good?

601
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,400
So, Justice, tell me
about your eclair.

602
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,800
I had the Black Forest cake

603
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,400
which had whipped cream,
chocolate, and cherries.

604
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,633
So I decided I was gonna do a
chocolate-cherry whipped cream

605
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:52,867
for my filling.

606
00:25:52,867 --> 00:25:54,567
And I did a chocolate ganache.

607
00:25:54,567 --> 00:25:56,900
But because I had
to have dried apricots,

608
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,633
I blended them up.

609
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,933
And I put them in the ganache.
-You put them into the ganache?

610
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,333
-Yeah.
-Hmm.

611
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,200
Huh, cool. You ever had
a Black Forest cake?

612
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,733
No. When that little
video popped up,

613
00:26:06,733 --> 00:26:08,567
I'm like, "Oh, I definitely
don't want that.

614
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,600
There's no way
I'm gonna get that one."

615
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,633
[ Laughter ]

616
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,633
I love how you put
the flavors

617
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:17,733
that we're gonna find inside
our eclair on top.

618
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:20,133
-Mm.
-Mm.

619
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:22,433
Oh, wow.

620
00:26:22,433 --> 00:26:24,467
That blew up all over me.
That's a good sign.

621
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,167
[ Laughs ]

622
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,600
I love that it's not
overly sweet.

623
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:30,067
I don't taste
the apricot yet.

624
00:26:30,067 --> 00:26:31,533
Apricot is not
a really big flavor.

625
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,233
If you've ever
seen a Black Forest cake,

626
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,100
you'll also see that there
are maraschino cherries.

627
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,567
It's actually pretty cool

628
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:37,900
that you used fresh cherries
instead of maraschinos.

629
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,167
Thank you.

630
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:40,133
Other thing
I got to tell you,

631
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:42,067
this dough is perfect --

632
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:44,433
crispy on the outside,
eggy on the inside.

633
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:46,133
-Well done.
-Justice, I'm impressed, man.

634
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:47,067
Good job.
-Thank you, Justice.

635
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:48,067
Thank you.

636
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:50,667
I'm so happy right now. Yes!

637
00:26:54,067 --> 00:26:56,800
-Audra.
-I got chocolate pecan pie.

638
00:26:56,800 --> 00:27:00,633
The elements I had
to include were chocolate,

639
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:03,600
pecans, and brown sugar.

640
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:09,500
And I made eclairs filled with
chocolate-pecan mousse

641
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:13,700
topped with
a brown-sugar pecan glaze.

642
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,733
And for the twist, I just put
some cranberries on top,

643
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,500
which I know is
a little uncreative.

644
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,233
But just don't try
to notice that too much.

645
00:27:21,233 --> 00:27:21,967
Don't try to
notice it too much?

646
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:23,733
Yeah.

647
00:27:23,733 --> 00:27:25,367
Your pâte à choux dough
looks really beautifully done.

648
00:27:25,367 --> 00:27:26,933
They're
nice-looking eclairs.

649
00:27:26,933 --> 00:27:29,167
-Oh, no.
-They're just not the same size.

650
00:27:29,167 --> 00:27:31,567
This is
the Duff-size eclair.

651
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,800
And then this is
the Audra-size eclair.

652
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,267
Your glaze -- so good.

653
00:27:36,267 --> 00:27:38,467
Totally taste the cranberry.
-Thank you.

654
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:40,900
So I got one little piece of
chocolate in the middle there.

655
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,767
It didn't go all the way
to the edges.

656
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:45,900
-Just eat the other half.
-You call this mousse?

657
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,633
-I call it a ganache.
-Mousse is light and fluffy.

658
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:48,767
Yeah.

659
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:50,433
And that's probably
why you had trouble

660
00:27:50,433 --> 00:27:52,467
because it's so thick.

661
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,533
Uh, but, man, your flavors
are right on.

662
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,233
I taste that --
that pecan pie.

663
00:27:56,233 --> 00:27:57,400
-Thank you.
-Good job.

664
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,567
Thanks, Audra.
Toodle-oo.

AIDAN:
I don't feel pretty good

667
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,067
about my eclairs, walking in.

668
00:28:06,067 --> 00:28:08,067
I just hope they taste good.

669
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,700
I hope that you like them.

670
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,300
Do you like them?

671
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,967
Um, I'm not
too big on dates.

672
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:16,233
I bet in like three
or four years,

673
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:17,933
you're gonna be
really into dates.

674
00:28:17,933 --> 00:28:19,467
[ Laughter ]

675
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,567
Maybe a bit longer
than that.

676
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,967
What was your
throwback dessert?

677
00:28:23,967 --> 00:28:26,567
I got a banana cream pie.

678
00:28:26,567 --> 00:28:29,300
What were the three elements
of the banana cream pie?

679
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:33,233
Graham-cracker crumbs,
vanilla pudding, and bananas.

680
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:37,600
I have the vanilla custard in
with a lot of fruit.

681
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:41,733
I have the bananas on top
and inside the custard.

682
00:28:41,733 --> 00:28:43,600
And there are
graham-cracker crumbs

683
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,733
inside the eclair
for a nice crunch

684
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,667
and dried dates.

685
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:51,567
Could you say that
with any more disgust?

686
00:28:51,567 --> 00:28:53,400
I'm gonna take a little taste.
-What did I just taste?

687
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,200
What is that?
What's sticky?

688
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,467
Uh, probably
the caramel sauce.

689
00:28:57,467 --> 00:29:00,067
-The caramel? It's delicious.
-It really is delicious.

690
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:02,067
Yeah.
Your caramel's really good.

691
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,133
I'm not crazy
about the strawberry.

692
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:06,233
I wish you had
just left it be dates...

693
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,600
Okay.

694
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,800
...because I think the
strawberry takes away from it.

695
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,333
And you don't need it.

696
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,067
-I'm right there with you.
-And I feel like the --

697
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,467
the challenge was to make

698
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:16,533
a banana cream pie
into an eclair.

699
00:29:16,533 --> 00:29:18,167
And had you left
out the strawberries,

700
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:20,400
it would've screamed
"banana cream pie."

701
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,600
Okay.

702
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,467
So it's not the dates
that threw you for the loop.

703
00:29:24,467 --> 00:29:25,967
I think
it's the strawberries.

00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:27,300
-Okay.
-Thank you, Aidan.

added the strawberries.

totally torpedoed this.

So, Jason, what was
your throwback dessert?

733
00:30:39,367 --> 00:30:40,900
For my throwback dessert,

734
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,867
I got
the grandma's apple pie.

735
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:47,967
So I had to have apples,
cinnamon, and nutmeg.

736
00:30:47,967 --> 00:30:49,267
And on the inside of my eclair,

737
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:52,300
I have a cinnamon pastry cream.

738
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,133
For the little tasty treat
you put in my lunch,

739
00:30:56,133 --> 00:31:00,200
I made a dried apricot compote.

740
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,100
When I see an eclair, I usually
like to see some kind of...

741
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,867
-Glaze?
-...glaze over it.

742
00:31:05,867 --> 00:31:09,600
Pie usually has a nice golden
color, not a glaze on it.

743
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,367
-I almost buy that.
-I ain't buying it.

744
00:31:11,367 --> 00:31:14,067
Almo-- I said,
"I almost buy it."

745
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:16,200
You got a nice amount
of cream in there.

746
00:31:19,067 --> 00:31:21,433
This is a pretty
thin pastry cream.

747
00:31:21,433 --> 00:31:24,567
You probably cooked the pastry
cream a little too long

748
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:25,867
'cause it got
a little scrambled.

749
00:31:25,867 --> 00:31:27,233
That's what happens
with eggs.

750
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,700
I really taste
the cinnamon in there.

751
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,067
I tasted nutmeg.

752
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:31,100
I would've liked
a little bit more nutmeg

753
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:33,067
'cause I do love nutmeg.

754
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:34,700
I am definitely
getting the apricot.

755
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,567
Really good job
with the twist.

756
00:31:36,567 --> 00:31:38,967
You incorporated it
in a very natural way.

757
00:31:38,967 --> 00:31:41,167
You didn't force it,
and it totally worked.

758
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,833
-Bye.
-See you later.

759
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:43,767
Thanks, Jason.

760
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:48,833
Cole, tell me
about your day today.

761
00:31:48,833 --> 00:31:52,067
Well, I had to remake
my pâte à choux.

[ Groans ]
-Hmm.

763
00:31:53,433 --> 00:31:55,067

So it's an eclair filled

764
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:57,633
with coconut-cream pie filling

765
00:31:57,633 --> 00:32:00,633
and whipped cream
dipped in ganache

766
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:04,233
and graham crackers
with hickory-smoked coconut.

767
00:32:04,233 --> 00:32:06,800
And the key ingredients
are vanilla custard,

768
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,367
coconut, and whipped cream.

769
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:12,067
And in my lunch box,
I got dried cranberries.

770
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:15,567
So I chopped 'em up really tiny
and put them in the ganache.

771
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:17,233
-Nice.
-And they're on top, too.

772
00:32:17,233 --> 00:32:19,167
Your eclair is
a little blonde.

773
00:32:19,167 --> 00:32:20,433
Yeah.
I was in a rush.

774
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:22,433
But they're cooked,
like, enough.

775
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:24,433
It's not raw.
It's not as crunchy, either.

776
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,367
But I like it.
Love the chocolate.

777
00:32:26,367 --> 00:32:28,067
I think the chocolate
is the star.

778
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,267
Yeah.
The cranberry --

779
00:32:29,267 --> 00:32:30,467
Love it
with the chocolate.

780
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:31,767
The coconut
is very subtle.

781
00:32:31,767 --> 00:32:34,300
I don't really taste
the smoke on there.

782
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,633
But I don't mind
that I don't taste it.

783
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:39,233
A lot of times, it just kind
of tastes like a campfire.

784
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,233
But great thinking.

785
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,300
I think that's awesome
that you pulled that smoker out.

786
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,467
You did a really good job.

787
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,900
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Cole.

788
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,067
-Thanks, Cole.
-Thank you.

-Man, that kid.
-He's so talented.

790
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,367
Hey, Maya.

791
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:55,900
I know that it
doesn't look good,

792
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,900
but I hope it tastes good.
-Did you have fun today?

793
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,433
-Yeah.
-That doesn't --

794
00:33:00,433 --> 00:33:01,733
-Wait.
-She said, "Yeah."

795
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:04,067
But I didn't --
It sounded like no.

796
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:07,367
No. Nothing
was really working today.

797
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:10,700
But at least I finished.

798
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,933
-Absolutely.
-You definitely finished.

799
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,133
What was your
throwback dessert

800
00:33:14,133 --> 00:33:15,367
that you had to turn
into an eclair?

801
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,500
-A German chocolate cake.
-Okay.

802
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,067
MAYA: Um, the three key
elements were chocolate,

803
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,933
pecans, and coconut.

804
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:24,067
So I made a regular eclair

805
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:27,200
with chocolate filling topped
with coconuts and pecans.

806
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,433
And my twist was dates.

807
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:32,100
I'm looking
at your pâte à choux.

808
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,500
Uh, it's a little flat.

809
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,767
Yeah.

810
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,200
I know what happened.

811
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,933
I think you put one
too many eggs in your dough.

812
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,633
Mm. I can taste it.

813
00:33:40,633 --> 00:33:42,100
Yeah, it's
a little eggy.

814
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,500
I think the dates
taste terrific on this.

815
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:48,067
Your chocolate is
quite delicious.

816
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,333
It's actually turned
into some sort of,

817
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:50,833
kind of fudge...
-Mm-hmm.

818
00:33:50,833 --> 00:33:51,967
-...which is really delicious.
-Delicious.

819
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,267
It's really nice.

820
00:33:53,267 --> 00:33:56,867
I'm not sure if it works
as an eclair filling.

821
00:33:56,867 --> 00:33:58,500
Mm-hmm.

822
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:00,133
But whatever it is, is awesome
and I want to eat more of it.

823
00:34:00,133 --> 00:34:01,367
I have all the flavors
in there

824
00:34:01,367 --> 00:34:03,167
that a German chocolate cake
should have.

825
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,967
And for that, I'm happy.
-And way to stick it out.

826
00:34:04,967 --> 00:34:06,233
-Thank you.
-Good job, Maya.

827
00:34:11,167 --> 00:34:12,700
Kaniyah, tell us
what you made today.

828
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:16,600
I made a cherry cheesecake
eclair.

829
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,367
I had to use cream cheese.
I had to use cherries.

830
00:34:19,367 --> 00:34:20,900
I had to use
graham-cracker crumbs.

831
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:23,333
And then what was
the dried fruit that you got?

832
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:26,267
I got raisins.
I put some inside the filling.

833
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:27,900
And I put some on top.

834
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,733
Hmm.
What is the filling?

835
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:32,167
It's a cherry
cream cheese filling.

836
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,233
I think you like it,
don't you?

837
00:34:33,233 --> 00:34:34,667
It was good.

838
00:34:34,667 --> 00:34:37,567
I used cream cheese
and cherries.

839
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:38,867
Just cream cheese
and cherries?

840
00:34:38,867 --> 00:34:40,167
Yeah.
-Sugar?

841
00:34:40,167 --> 00:34:42,167
No. It's enough sugar
in the cherries.

842
00:34:42,167 --> 00:34:44,333
-Huh, okay.
-What is the sticky stuff?

843
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,967
KANIYAH: It's cherry puree.

844
00:34:45,967 --> 00:34:47,467
It's supposed
to be the topping.

845
00:34:47,467 --> 00:34:48,933
Whoa.
That is nice and full.

846
00:34:48,933 --> 00:34:50,600
Mm-hmm.

847
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,700
So y-- you think that the
cherries were sweet enough

848
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,067
to make that filling sweet
enough for this eclair?

849
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:58,600
I don't think you think so.

850
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,900
Well, I think so, too.

851
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,633
I think that filling
is perfect.

cream-cheese filling.

think of cheesecake.

My '70s throwback dessert

865
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,167
was a pineapple
upside-down cake.

866
00:35:39,167 --> 00:35:41,100
My elements were cherries,

pineapple, and brown sugar.
-All right.

868
00:35:43,333 --> 00:35:45,567

that we threw at you?

869

Raisins.

870
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:47,867
Raisins.

871
00:35:47,867 --> 00:35:49,300
I used my raisins

872
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,133
by putting them
in my pâte à choux dough.

873
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:53,200

their own little personality.

That's for sure.

A little crazy
with the powdered sugar.

I'm -- I'm hoping it's powdered
sugar and not flour.

Yeah. They're a little --
they're a little rustic.

I think they're
a little rustic, you know?

888

with chocolate

889
00:36:22,633 --> 00:36:25,067
for pineapple
upside-down cake?

890
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:26,400
It's not bad 'cause
when you think

891
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,900
of an eclair,
you think of chocolate.

892
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,100
However, I don't have
any cream in my eclair.

I got pastry cream on this side,
not on this side.

895
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,633
I think your eclairs
are a little wonky,

just a little bit
more pastry cream.

For me, these pancake cakes,

85
00:03:32,367 --> 00:03:33,933
it's definitely difficult

86
00:03:33,933 --> 00:03:36,633
because this cake
breaks easily.

87
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,067
* Ahh! *

88
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:40,233
Nailed it!

89
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,067
Tastes delicious.

90
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:43,933
How are my pancake
peeps doing?

91
00:03:43,933 --> 00:03:45,633
-Good!
-Good!

92
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:48,767
I hate waffles.

93
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:50,100
[ Gasps ]
How dare you?

94
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,200
Last week,
I was in the bottom.

95
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,700
And it was horrible.

96
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,167
So this week,

97
00:03:55,167 --> 00:03:57,233
I just need to get back
in the competition

98
00:03:57,233 --> 00:03:58,800
and do what I do best.

99
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,567
And that is bake.

100
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:05,067
I'm making a cinnamon
roll stack of waffles

101
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:08,600
with a basic
vanilla cake recipe.

102
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
And then I'm gonna have cream
cheese frosting on it.

103
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,267
It's gonna be delicious.

104
00:04:12,267 --> 00:04:14,400
This idea comes
from breakfast.

105
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,233
I mean, cinnamon rolls,

106
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:19,767
mm, waffles,
yummy, yummy.

107
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:22,567
My lovely waffle batter.

108
00:04:22,567 --> 00:04:25,300
In anticipation
of my victory,

109
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:28,067
I got some
custom jewelry made.

110
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,867
There it is.
-Very impressive.

111
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:37,233
What do you got?

112
00:04:37,233 --> 00:04:40,567
A pat of butter,
as every pancake

113
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:43,233
should have
a pat of butter.

114
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:45,533
Oh!
So many strawberries.

115
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:49,333
I like my waffles soft,
not soggy, though.

116
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:50,933
That's just gross.

117
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,367
I'm planning on making

118
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:55,433
a strawberry cheesecake
stacked waffle cake,

119
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,067
then putting
cream cheese frosting

120
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:58,733
in the middle of each layer.

121
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:02,367
I'm starting off with my white
cake batter for my waffles.

122
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,333
Mm, smells like strawberries.

123
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,167
I love strawberries,

124
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,067
favorite fruit
in the whole entire world.

125
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,733
Let's give this thing a taste.

126
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,400
Oh, that's really good.

127
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,500
This first one is just
to see how much time

128
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,400
to cook it for

129
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,633
and how should I take it out.

130
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:26,067
Oh, my God.
It's just ripping.

131
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,167
Oh, my God.

132
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:32,067
Figuring out how to cook
these waffles

133
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,067
made of cake batter.

134
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:35,967
It's really not the same.

135
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:38,467
No. It's crumbling.

136
00:05:38,467 --> 00:05:41,267
And it's actually pretty soft.

137
00:05:41,267 --> 00:05:44,233
This test is a fail.

138
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,400
Guess I'll try another one.

139
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,200
Pancake batter cake.
Pancake batter cake.

140
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,067
I have been making pancakes
since I was 7.

141
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:53,900
So this should be pretty easy.

142
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,933
I'm gonna kind of do
a rainbow effect on my pancake.

143
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,300
It's going to be a lemon cake.

144
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,600
Filling is going to be
maybe raspberry or blueberry.

145
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,767
I'm doing lemon and rainbow
because I want it to stand out.

146
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:09,067
I think that's enough.

147
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,233
I'm separating my batter

148
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:12,733
to make it three
different colors.

149
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,667
I like these colors.

150
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:15,967
Check out Kaniyah, man.

151
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:18,067
Those are some
bright pancakes.

152
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,233
Think I'll add
more lemon juice.

153
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:21,133
I'm adding more lemon juice

154
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,900
because it wasn't lemon enough.

155
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,533
I want to get this just right
for the queen of pancakes

156
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:31,067
that's sitting on a pile
of butter and plastic syrup.

157
00:06:31,067 --> 00:06:32,733
There's that lemon taste.

158
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,300
My dad gave me this tip.

159
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,200
When the pancake bubbles

160
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,567
in the middle
and around the edges,

161
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,700
that means it's ready
to be flipped.

162
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,167
Come on. Come on.
I taste my test pancake.

163
00:06:42,167 --> 00:06:44,467
And it tastes good.

164
00:06:44,467 --> 00:06:45,867
It's lemon.

165
00:06:45,867 --> 00:06:47,367
It's great.

166
00:06:47,367 --> 00:06:49,767
Aidan, do you still
have the cinnamon?

167
00:06:49,767 --> 00:06:51,067
-Yeah.
-Can I use it?

168
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,667
-Yeah. I'm all done.
-Thanks.

169
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:55,667
Valerie, I'll be
your loyal subject.

170
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,833
I think pancakes
are better because

171
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:01,667
that's what I cook for my family
about every week.

172
00:07:01,667 --> 00:07:04,700
My cake that I'll be making
to transform into a pancake

173
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,433
will be a carrot cake.

174
00:07:06,433 --> 00:07:10,833
The filling will be
a cream cheese buttercream.

175
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,700
I grab cinnamon and carrots.

176
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,100
And I start to make
a classic white cake.

177
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,333
Justice, look at this carrot.

178
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,767
Duff, I'm shaving carrots.

179
00:07:20,767 --> 00:07:24,100
If you ever need me
to cut your hair, call me.

180
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,833
I want a carrot in every bite.

181
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:29,100
Cinnamon and nutmeg,
I'm just measuring by look.

182
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,900
And I think using more spices

183
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:35,867
will bring a nice darker color
to my pancake cake.

184
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:38,433
I want more nutmeg.

185
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,267
I'm ready to start
making my pancake.

186
00:07:40,267 --> 00:07:44,100
I have never used a cake batter
to make pancakes.

187
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,067
So they keep breaking.

188
00:07:46,067 --> 00:07:50,067
And I hope that I can figure out
a way so that it can work.

189
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:52,633
Gosh, my pancakes
are not flipping.

190
00:07:52,633 --> 00:07:55,067
All my pancakes
are breaking apart.

191
00:07:55,067 --> 00:07:57,500
It fell apart.

192
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,633
All right.

193
00:07:59,633 --> 00:08:02,400
Reese's batter
is kind of thin.

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,800
VALERIE: Oh, it really looks
like he's struggling

195
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,600
to flip his pancakes
without breaking them.

196
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,100
I'm probably gonna have
to build my cake

197
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:12,533
out of the broken pancake.

198
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:13,467
Oh.

199
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:14,633
I have a joke.

200
00:08:14,633 --> 00:08:17,967
So the griddle says
to the waffle iron,

201
00:08:17,967 --> 00:08:19,467
"You're pretty cute."

202
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:23,933
And the waffle iron says
[Laughing]

203
00:08:23,933 --> 00:08:26,100
"Stop buttering me up."

204
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,600
I got the waffle coin.

205
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,267
And I'm gonna make a chocolate
hazelnut spread waffle

206
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:37,167
with chocolate-covered
strawberry

207
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:38,367
cream cheese buttercream.

208
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:39,900
And hopefully, if I have time,

209
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,233
I'm gonna put some bacon strips
in between each layer.

210
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:44,767
I get to making
my cake batter.

211
00:08:44,767 --> 00:08:48,067
I chose to use my favorite
chocolate cake recipe

212
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,167
'cause it goes
with strawberries,

213
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:52,567
goes with hazelnut spread.

214
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:55,733
And I wanted it to taste
like chocolate-dipped bacon.

215
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,833
And I put it in the waffle iron.

216
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:02,067
And it smells so good.

217
00:09:02,067 --> 00:09:04,100
Is this a perfect waffle to you?

218
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,767
Is it
a chocolate waffle?

219
00:09:05,767 --> 00:09:08,500
Okay. 'Cause if it
was not a chocolate waffle,

220
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,467
I'd say
it's pretty burnt.

221
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:13,067
You should get
a waffle tattoo.

222
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:14,767
I should get
a waffle tattoo.

223
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:17,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see who wins.

224
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,800
All right. Hey.
Here's the thing.

225
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,067
Team Waffles.
-Yeah?

226
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,467
If you guys
bring home the gold,

227
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:28,367
I will go out
and get a waffle tattoo.

228
00:09:28,367 --> 00:09:29,867
-Will you actually?
-Yeah.

229
00:09:29,867 --> 00:09:31,233
That's extra motivation.

230
00:09:31,233 --> 00:09:33,333
And guess what,
Team Pancakes?

231
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,700
I won't.
-Lame.

232
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,733
I'm lame.

233
00:09:37,733 --> 00:09:39,067
Butter, butter, butter,
butter, butter,

234
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:40,467
butter, butter,
butter, butter.

235
00:09:40,467 --> 00:09:43,067
I pledge of allegiance
to the waffle

236
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:46,067
of the United Waffles
of Wafflelandia.

237
00:09:46,067 --> 00:09:48,600
I am going to make
an orange cake.

238
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,367
And I'll do, like, maybe
an orange curd in the middle.

239
00:09:52,367 --> 00:09:54,400
And I might do
a strawberry buttercream.

240
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,233
And then I'll decorate it
with, like,

241
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,933
orange slices
and strawberries.

242
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,367
For my waffle cake batter,

243
00:09:59,367 --> 00:10:03,867
I add some vanilla
and some orange extract.

244
00:10:03,867 --> 00:10:05,300
I put the orange in there

245
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,667
'cause it's a complete
balanced breakfast.

246
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,733
I'm adding orange sprinkles
because orange sprinkles

247
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:12,700
will be like
confetti orange cake.

248
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:15,300
And I think that'll
look cool in my waffles.

249
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:19,633
I'm not a breakfast guy.
I really like to sleep.

250
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:22,067
When your waffle's done,
you want a crispy outside shell

251
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:25,533
and a nice warm inside.

252
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,000
Yes.

253
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,667
I'm surveying my kingdom.

254
00:10:30,033 --> 00:10:31,200
Hot.

255
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,367
Waffle time.

256
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:37,767
The thing that will make
this waffle stack special

257
00:10:37,767 --> 00:10:41,300
is my cinnamon brown sugar
butter swirl mixture.

258
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:45,967
It will be a nice, thick,
almost kind of a sludge,

259
00:10:45,967 --> 00:10:48,333
but the best possible sludge.

260
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,700
Okay.
It's too chunky.

261
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,300
My cinnamon mixture
is a lot thicker

262
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,900
than I thought it would be.

263
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:00,067
There's, like, big chunks,
and they get stuck.

264
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:02,067
By the time I get it all in,

265
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,700
the bottoms of my waffles

266
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:07,433
are probably a lot more cooked
than the top is gonna be.

267
00:11:07,433 --> 00:11:09,400
I'm just hoping that
this turns out right.

268
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,067
So I just close up
the waffle iron and let it cook.

269
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,467
But I definitely
overfilled them.

270
00:11:14,467 --> 00:11:16,800
This isn't going
as fun as I thought.

271
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,133
When I make waffles at home,

272
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:20,067
I just don't usually
go over the top.

273
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:22,267
And this is more complicated.

274
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:24,933
Okay. Darn swirl.

275
00:11:24,933 --> 00:11:27,900
Um...It's stuck.

276
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,167
They're all sticking.

277
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,833
And I try to get the tongs.

278
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,233
And by the time I get them out,
they're just all mangled up.

279
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:37,667
And they're gross.
It's just falling apart.

280
00:11:37,667 --> 00:11:39,667
I can't use this.

281
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,600
This is gonna have
to be pitched.

282
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,467
These are
the worst waffles ever.

283
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:59,100
Duff, my waffles
turned out horrible.

284
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,600
I cannot use these
mangled-up waffles.

285
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,267
Come on, Aidan.
Pull it together, man.

286
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:05,600
In the garbage.

287
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,533
I have to completely
recook my waffles.

288
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:11,367
Thankfully, I have
lots of batter left.

289
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:14,067
I am not gonna
overfill these again.

290
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,267
Bakers, may we have
your attention?

291
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:17,833
-Oh!
-Uh-oh.

292
00:12:17,833 --> 00:12:19,833
I just don't want to know.

293
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:24,200
We are taking this challenge
to the next level.

294
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:28,133
In order to make the ultimate
breakfast desserts,

295
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:31,833
you also have to use
one breakfast cereal

296
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,267
to decorate your cake.

297
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,767
-Yes, yes, yes!
-Whoa.

298
00:12:34,767 --> 00:12:36,333
-No.
-What?

299
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:38,533
We are providing you
with all kinds of cereal

300
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:39,800
to choose from.

301
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,933
Must choose wisely.

302
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:43,233
AIDAN: All right.
This is perfect.

303
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:45,333
I see a delicious
cinnamon cereal

304
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:48,367
that will pair perfectly
with everything else.

305
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,567

306

-Pancakes.
-I will -- I will -- I will...

What's it gonna be,
Audra?

308
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,067
No idea because
none of this stuff

309
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:57,933
goes with what
I'm making.

310
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,333
Wait. Wait. Okay.

-Trust your instincts.
-Trust your instincts.

312
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,200
But you better get moving.

313
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,300
AUDRA:
I decide to choose corn cereal

314
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,333
because it seems like kind
of a vanilla flavor.

315
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:10,900
And I think it might go
with my cake a little bit.

316
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,200
I'm only using it
in the decoration

317
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,433
and maybe in between
some layers.

318
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:19,900
Perfect. This time
when I cook my waffles,

319
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,100
they come out
pretty darn good.

320
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,400
Well, I guess I'll
prepare my frosting.

321
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,267
To make my cream cheese
frosting,

322
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:30,233
I cream together
my powdered sugar

323
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:32,600
and my cream cheese and butter

324
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,600
until that is ooey,
gooey and delicious.

325
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:38,767
Icing.

326
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:42,567
So Waffle Kingdom
is known for stability.

327
00:13:42,567 --> 00:13:44,167
But you're a little crusty
on the outside.

328
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,467
We are a little crusty
on the outside.

329
00:13:45,467 --> 00:13:48,067
That's what gives us
our backbone, our spine.

330
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:49,700
I'm light and fluffy.

331
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,333
I don't know
if you want to be fluffy.

332
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,067
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

333
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:58,600
Fruit rice cereal,
substitute for sprinkles.

334
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,933
And that's gonna look good
on top of my cake.

This is going great.
Great.

Boom.
This is awesome.

340
00:14:16,067 --> 00:14:18,800
So I'm gonna
start my buttercream.

341
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,633
For my buttercream, it's just
butter and powdered sugar.

342
00:14:22,633 --> 00:14:24,800
Ah. And I think
it's gonna go really well

343
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,400
with the lemon cake.

344
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,500
We're all friends.
But waffles suck.

345
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,533
I know it's ready to go
when it looks like buttercream.

00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:34,133
Raspberries.

347
00:14:34,133 --> 00:14:37,367
Then I start
on my raspberry puree.

348
00:14:37,367 --> 00:14:40,400
And I need sugar
to make it sweet.

349
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:43,333
I'm straining my puree to make
sure there are no seeds

350
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:45,867
because that would be nasty.

351
00:14:45,867 --> 00:14:48,067
Okay. Got this.

352
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:50,200
This is the moment of truth

353
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,433
because if my waffles
don't turn out, it's over.

354
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,200
This is my second attempt.

355
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:59,067
And I don't have enough batter
to do a third one.

356
00:15:00,067 --> 00:15:02,067
Wow.

357
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,367
Now, that is a waffle.
Whoo.

358
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,800
So I get those
in the blast chiller

359
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,733
and start my frosting.

360
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:10,767
What's everyone
think of the twist?

361
00:15:10,767 --> 00:15:13,133
I'm just gonna sprinkle it
wherever I can.

362
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,533
I got corn flakes

363
00:15:14,533 --> 00:15:16,667
because they're just nice
and, like, simple.

364
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,333
I plan on using my cereal

365
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,933
on top of my orange curd
in each layer

366
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:23,233
and then on top of my cake.

367
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,733
Audra, are you gonna use
all those strawberries?

368
00:15:24,733 --> 00:15:27,067
No. Actually, I'm done
with the strawberries.

369
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,700
Oh. Yeah.
I need strawberries

370
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,133
to make
my strawberry buttercream.

371
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:31,667
I put them through
the strainer.

372
00:15:31,667 --> 00:15:34,200
And I get all the nice
strawberry juices out.

373
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,933
And I start to whip up
my buttercream.

374
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,433

pretty good about time.

to get this done

So I put 'em in the oven,
just to get 'em a little toasty.

386
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:03,800
When you roast any nut,

00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,300
it really brings out their oils.

For the twist today,

400

I'm using
a cinnamon crunch cereal

401
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,233
because it's a cinnamon
chocolate cake.

402
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:38,167

00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,333
Gather together a donut pan,
cake batter,

438
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,200
chocolate glaze
and candy sprinkles.

439
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,967
Pour the batter
into donut molds

440
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,533
and bake off your donuts.

441
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,567
Dip donuts into glaze.

442
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:47,400
Stack them up and add
some festive sprinkles.

443
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,300
Make a stacked donut party.

444
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,067

446
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:59,200
Dang it. You got to be
kidding me. I forgot my butter.

447
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,567
I hope this will
help my pancakes

448
00:19:02,567 --> 00:19:04,333
stay together now.

449
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,467
Yay.
My pancakes are working.

450
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,733
Whew. I'm ready
to start my frosting.

451
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:12,667
So I get my cream cheese,
butter, and cream that.

452
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:15,533
I have to have it
all the way mixed.

453
00:19:15,533 --> 00:19:18,067
And I'm gonna be putting
my fruity cereal in my butter.

454
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,967
That's exactly
what I did.

455
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:23,767
Oh, wow. You get, like,
a crunch with your frosting.

456
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:26,533
It looks pretty cool,
like a rainbow.

457
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:29,300
DUFF: You guys need to start
stacking your cakes.

458
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,600
You got, like,
3 minutes left.

459
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,067
No, I'm kidding.

460
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:35,200
-JK.
-Kidding.

461
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,433
You do have
20 minutes left.

462
00:19:37,433 --> 00:19:39,067
Team Waffles,
you've got to win.

463
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:41,133
I want this tattoo.

464
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:42,467
JUSTICE:
He's not gonna get, like,

465
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:45,367
"Waffle Team"
tattooed on his arm.

466
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,600
Why would he do that?

467
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,133
Where? Where?
Where? Where?

468
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,433
I'm ready to start
building my cake.

469
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,100
Before I started
putting my curd in,

470
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,367
I tasted it to make sure
it tastes like orange.

471
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,400
And it doesn't taste
a lot like orange.

472
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,500
So I decided to get
some orange extract

473
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,067
and put that in there as well.

474
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:03,333
And now it tastes
more orange-y.

475
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,633
Justice is the only
baker using curd.

476
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,600
VALERIE: I love curd.

477
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,400
Let them eat curd.

478
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,300
So I start by making
a dam around each waffle,

479
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:18,267
putting some curd
in between that, cereal in.

480
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:20,667
-That looks amazing.
-Do you really think so?

481
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:21,933
It's pretty good.

482
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:25,667
And then I cover the top
with the strawberry buttercream.

483
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,267
And I pipe a little border
around my cake.

484
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:31,100
That is
professional piping.

485
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,767
-Waffles.
-Pancakes.

486
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:35,033
-Waffles.
-Pancakes.

487
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:37,567
-Waffles.
-Pancakes.

488
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,533
I need to get started
on stacking.

489
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:41,700
So I put a little bit
of hazelnut spread down,

490
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:45,167
stick the waffle on,
spread my buttercream,

491
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:47,800
put a ring of hazelnut
spread around,

492
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,967
fresh strawberries,

493
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:50,267
toasted hazelnuts,

494
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,100
cinnamon crunch cereal, stacked.

495
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,667
Forgot the bacon.

496
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,633
This big bake
is so important

497
00:20:56,633 --> 00:20:59,300
because I want to be
the first boy

498
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,067
"Kids Baking" champion.

499
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,367
And I want that $25,000.

500
00:21:03,367 --> 00:21:05,600
Snowing in Waffletown.

501
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,133
Oh, my God.
It's looking, uh, boo-tiful.

502
00:21:09,133 --> 00:21:13,300
Wafflelites,
winner is coming.

503
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,800
-Really?
-In Waffletown?

504
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,167
Are there actual humans?

505
00:21:17,167 --> 00:21:18,533
Or are they, like,
walking waffles?

506
00:21:18,533 --> 00:21:20,133
-No. They're humans.
-Humans.

507
00:21:20,133 --> 00:21:21,767
Yeah.
Everybody's a human.

508
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:23,233
Oh, it smells like heaven.

509
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:26,700
Frosting, in my book,
is what really makes a cake.

510
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,233
When I was little,
I used to like the frosting

511
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:30,633
more than the cake.

512
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:34,400
And I might actually
like it a bit more now.

513
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,167
Come on, cream cheese.
Come on, cream cheese.

514
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:38,067
Come on...Mm.

515
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:41,700
I'm going to have cream cheese
frosting between each layer

516
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,367
and sprinkle on
pecans and cereal...

517
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:48,533
Nice little crunch.

518
00:21:48,533 --> 00:21:50,600
And then repeat that process.

519
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,067
Look at my stack.

520
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:54,400
Don't you think
it looks great?

521
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,467
I mean, it's a'ight.
No. It looks awesome.

522
00:21:57,467 --> 00:21:59,867
My waffle stack is gonna be

523
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,067
a more rustic stack of waffles.

524
00:22:02,067 --> 00:22:03,533
I grab some cinnamon sticks

525
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,567
and put those on in a nice
little cross fashion.

526
00:22:06,567 --> 00:22:08,167
I love cinnamon.

527
00:22:08,167 --> 00:22:09,633
Face it, Val.

528
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:12,100
Waffles are just more
exciting than pancakes.

529
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,167
Think of the royal
Belgian waffle.

530
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:18,300
No idea what's in that.

531
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:21,567
Pancakes are literally
a cake made in a pan.

532
00:22:21,567 --> 00:22:22,900
Semantics, Val.

533
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,133
Semantics.

534
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:27,133
JASON:
It's time to start stacking.

535
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:29,700
Spread the buttercream,
lay a pancake.

536
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,600
Spread buttercream,
lay pancake.

537
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,233
Spread buttercream,
lay pancake.

538
00:22:33,233 --> 00:22:35,700
It's not the prettiest thing,
but...

539
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,333
The cherry on top

540
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:40,200
will make this thing
look awesome.

541
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,167
I grab my "raspberry syrup"...

542
00:22:43,167 --> 00:22:45,200
It's more of a spread now.

543
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:50,333
Spread that on top
of my pancake stack.

544
00:22:51,833 --> 00:22:53,667
I'm liking this challenge.

545
00:22:53,667 --> 00:22:56,300
For my topping,
I mix cream cheese,

546
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,400
milk and powdered sugar.

547
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,700
Yummy.

548
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,633
Perfect.

549
00:23:01,633 --> 00:23:03,333
I'm gonna get
stacking my cakes.

550
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:04,267
Stack 'em.
Stack 'em. Stack 'em.

551
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,067
Stack 'em.
Stack 'em.

552
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:09,400
I pipe a ring of icing around
on the edge of the pancake.

553
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,700
And then I fill it
with the raspberry filling.

554
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,633
The buttercream ring
is gonna help

555
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:17,467
keep the raspberry
filling kept inside

556
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:20,567
and not have it go, "Phbt!"

557
00:23:20,567 --> 00:23:23,333
Somebody's going home
on the waffles team.

558
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,933
10 minutes left!

559
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:27,900
Okay. I'm doing good.

560
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,400
So hurry up!

561
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,767
'Kay!

562
00:23:30,767 --> 00:23:32,833
REESE: Wonder if any of these
pancakes will work.

563
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:34,967
They're all messed up.

564
00:23:34,967 --> 00:23:37,167
I'm starting
to assemble my cake.

565
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:39,167
And I build my cake by, like,

566
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,367
getting pieces
from broken pancakes

567
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,800
and put that together.

568
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,267
No. I'm, like,
making a puzzle right now,

569
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,267
but with pancakes.

570
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,567
It's leaning!

571
00:23:49,567 --> 00:23:51,700
It might not look
like a perfect cake.

572
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,600
But it does look like
a decent plate of pancakes.

573
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,067
Yay. 10 layers.

574
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:59,067
I want to put chocolate
and a cherry on top of my cake

575
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:02,067
because I think that would be
pretty nice for presentation.

576
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:06,133
There's a lot of pressure
to make this cake really well.

577
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,100
The clock is my enemy.

578
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,633
Three minutes!

579
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:11,167
Waffle Team rocks!

580
00:24:11,167 --> 00:24:13,600
-How are you doing?
-Good.

581
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,400
-My stack's all done.
-Oh, great.

582
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,267
To assemble my cake,
first add the waffle.

583
00:24:19,267 --> 00:24:22,900
Then I add some cream cheese,
add some puree.

584
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:27,400
Not the best presentation,
but it'll taste delicious.

585
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,300
Sprinkle some of
the corn cereal on,

586
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,067
put some more cream
cheese and waffle.

587
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:36,467
And I just keep
repeating that

588
00:24:36,467 --> 00:24:39,133
until my cake is all assembled.

589
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:41,633
I just need a little
more frosting.

590
00:24:41,633 --> 00:24:45,533
It's really messy,
which I'm worried about.

591
00:24:45,533 --> 00:24:47,200
[ Gasps ] Oh, no.

592
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,567
-Oh, no.
-Oh, man.

593
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:50,967
Audra, honey.

594
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:52,733
Waffle tectonics.

595
00:24:52,733 --> 00:24:54,467
Oh, no.

596
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:59,067
It looks like
a giant cream cheese monster

597
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,500
is getting hacked to pieces.

598
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,933
[ Gasps ] Oh, no.
This is terrible.

599
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:12,067
Oh, no. Okay.

600
00:25:12,067 --> 00:25:13,633
A big chunk
of my cake falls out.

601
00:25:13,633 --> 00:25:15,200
And I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

602
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,700
Oh. Oh, no.

603
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,333
There's no recovering
from this avalanche.

604
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:24,100
Audra's waffle stack
has just collapsed.

605
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,767
And this does not
look good for my side.

606
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:29,367
-Dang it!
-Two minutes.

607
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:33,300
We want to see a waffle
cake and a pancake.

608
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,333
Cake.

609
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,733
Pancake...
Right.

610
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,267
Fruit cereal.

611
00:25:37,267 --> 00:25:38,800
It looks awesome.

612
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,533
I'll pipe a "P" for pancake.

613
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,100
There.

614
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,800
This brings me so much joy.

615
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,267
Oh, look at that.

616
00:25:46,267 --> 00:25:49,600
Aidan is making ice cream,
little extra credit.

617
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,867
Waffles
and ice cream, man.

618
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,067
Yum.

619
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:55,200
A waffle stack a la mode.

620
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,667
Cinnamon crunch
cereal ice cream.

621
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:02,167
I have my bowl of milk
and cereal with my ice cream.

622
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:03,700
I don't care if it gets soggy.

623
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,567
I just want it to have
a little cinnamon.

624
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,433
Oh. Delicious.

625
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:11,600
I just want
to straight eat this.

626
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,800
What's stopping me?

627
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,100
My dignity.

628
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,900
30 seconds, guys.

629
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,500
Go, go, go, bakers!

630
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,400
Reese, please get
your cake made.

631
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,900
We're running
out of time.

632
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,833
-I'm trying.
-Do you need help?

633
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,400
Well, can you
get me a cherry?

634
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,100
-Uh, sure.
-Even though Justice

635
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,267
is on the waffle side,
he still helped me.

636
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:31,200
And I'm really
thankful for that.

637
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,233
Hurry, hurry, hurry.
Just put -- scoop some on.

638
00:26:33,233 --> 00:26:35,400
Now if I could
just stop the clock...

639
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,867
Cherry on top now?
Or...

640
00:26:36,867 --> 00:26:38,600
Yeah. Sure.

641
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:44,133
DUFF AND VALERIE:
10...9...8...7...6...

642
00:26:44,133 --> 00:26:49,067
5...4...3...2...1!

643
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:52,133
DUFF: Hands up!

644
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:53,467
All righty.

645
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:56,500
It is the great
breakfast bake-off.

646
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,500
-Yes. Yes.
-We asked for pancake cakes...

647
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,200
-Mm-hmm.
-...and waffle cakes.

648
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,067
Bring on the breakfast!

649
00:27:02,067 --> 00:27:03,933
Shall we call in Audra?

650
00:27:03,933 --> 00:27:05,333
I think we should.

651
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,933
-Audra?
-Hi.

652
00:27:06,933 --> 00:27:08,467
Tell us about
your waffle cake.

653
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:11,833
For my waffle cake,
I made a strawberry cheesecake.

654
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:15,133
And the cream cheese
frosting is the cheesecake.

655
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,700
For my cereal,
I got corn cereal.

656
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:23,167
And I kind of just sprinkled
those everywhere.

657
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:25,067
It's a little messy,
only a little.

658
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,467
Where's the waffle?

659
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:27,833
Oh.

660
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:31,900
Um, under the frosting?

661
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,600
Well, it definitely
looks like

662
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,500
that fell apart
a little bit.

663
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,267
I want
to taste that thing.

664
00:27:37,267 --> 00:27:39,167
I really don't want to go home.

665
00:27:39,167 --> 00:27:41,900
I've already told my cat,
Rory, that if I win,

666
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,133
she's gonna get
a bunch of toys.

667
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:46,067
So I can't let her down.

668
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,333
Nice. Nice crispy
waffle right here.

669
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,500
Mm-hmm.

670
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,367
That's exactly what
you want in a waffle.

671
00:27:54,367 --> 00:27:56,267
I'm loving the flavor.

672
00:27:56,267 --> 00:27:58,233
Seems like the frosting's
a little sweet.

673
00:27:58,233 --> 00:28:01,067
I don't really taste
the cream cheese

674
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:03,133
as much as
I taste the sugar.

675
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:05,167
The cereal's not working
like I thought it would.

676
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,267
When it's in the layers,

677
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:10,067
It just kind of gets chewy.
-But listen.

678
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,667
You got great waffles here.
-Mm-hmm.

679
00:28:11,667 --> 00:28:13,067
I could really taste
the strawberries.

680
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,900
It's nice.
Thanks.

681
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,833
-Bye.
-Why is she so sad?

682
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,067
She was hanging
her head.

683
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,500
I don't want to
hurt her feelings.

684
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,067
She knows
she didn't do a good job.

685
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,333
Justice.

686
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,800
That looks spectacular.

687
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,267
Thank you.

688
00:28:30,267 --> 00:28:31,900
This is what you
should be doing in life.

689
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,633
So for my waffle cake,

690
00:28:34,633 --> 00:28:36,633
I made an orange cake

691
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,867
and then orange curd to go
in between each layer.

692
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:42,400
And I sprinkled corn flakes
on top of the cake.

693
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,767
I also piped
strawberry buttercream

694
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:48,067
around each one
and then did it on top, too.

695
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,300
That's amazing.

696
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,900
I love your color palette.
-Mm-hmm.

697
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,167
I mean,
everything goes together.

698
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,733
It's absolutely beautiful.

699
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,267
Let's taste it.

700
00:28:56,267 --> 00:29:00,100
Well, Duff, I can be a worker
at Charm City Cakes.

701
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,167
Delicious waffles.

702
00:29:05,167 --> 00:29:06,600
Thank you.

703
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,067
They're moist where
they should be moist.

704
00:29:08,067 --> 00:29:09,300
They're crispy where
they should be crispy.

705
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,067
I mean, your buttercream
is really good.

706
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,300
I love the use
of the cereal.

707
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,133
You got a little
tiny crunch in there.

708
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,967
The one thing I can say
is I think you used

709
00:29:15,967 --> 00:29:18,433
a tiny bit too much
of the zest.

710
00:29:18,433 --> 00:29:19,833
Yeah.

711
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:22,400
The curd
is almost too sweet.

712
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,100
And it's almost
too bitter.

713
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,133
It really needs
to be evened out.

714
00:29:26,133 --> 00:29:27,567
But you're really coming
into your own

715
00:29:27,567 --> 00:29:28,700
late in this contest.

716
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,667
And you're just shooting
for it, aren't you?

717
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:31,667
[ Laughter ]

718
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,367
Thank you, Justice.
-Thank you.

719
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,600
-Thanks, man.
-This is not a good curd.

720
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,633
He could have left
the curd out.

721
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,233
And it would have been
a perfect waffle cake.

722
00:29:39,233 --> 00:29:40,500
Yeah. Yeah.

723
00:29:42,467 --> 00:29:43,500
Hi, Aidan.

724
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,167
Tell me about
your waffle cake.

725
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:49,567
It's a vanilla cake
with a cinnamon swirl.

726
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,667
And I have
a cream cheese frosting

727
00:29:51,667 --> 00:29:55,200
with a little bit of pecans
and cinnamon crunch cereal.

728
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,700
Now, what's going
on in here?

729
00:29:56,700 --> 00:30:00,200
That is a cinnamon crunch
cereal ice cream.

730
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,800
It's kind of like
a bowl of cereal.

731
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,267
I love it. I think
it's a nice-looking cake.

732
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,933
It's a little bit messy.

733
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:08,367
But it's a good messy.
-Okay.

734
00:30:08,367 --> 00:30:10,300
I think you thought
about how you were

735
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:12,567
gonna incorporate the cereal
into your waffles.

736
00:30:12,567 --> 00:30:15,233
It's absolutely beautiful.
-I think we should taste it.

737
00:30:15,233 --> 00:30:16,700
Am I gonna bite into
something delicious?

738
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,267
Yes, you are.

739
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:19,233
I just don't want
to bite into one

740
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,833
of those cinnamon sticks.

741
00:30:20,833 --> 00:30:22,667
Yeah.
Oops.

742
00:30:22,667 --> 00:30:24,967
I wish that I could
eat these waffle slices.

743
00:30:24,967 --> 00:30:26,167
You guys are so lucky.

744
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:29,267
You get to eat
all of this stuff.

745
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:30,967
Thank you, Aidan.

746
00:30:30,967 --> 00:30:32,733
I'm excited about
this ice cream.

747
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:38,167
Mmm.

748
00:30:38,167 --> 00:30:40,167
Texture's amazing.

749
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:43,000
It tastes like I'm eating
a heightened version

750
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,733
of a bowl of cinnamon
crunch cereal.

751
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:46,700
Oh, man.

752
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Cinnamon waffles.

753
00:31:00,533 --> 00:31:03,067
Dang.

754
00:31:03,067 --> 00:31:05,367
That's awesome.

755
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:06,833
That cream cheese frosting
is perfectly balanced,

756
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:09,533
just sweet enough,
taste the cream cheese.

757
00:31:09,533 --> 00:31:12,633
All the flavors are going
so perfectly together.

758
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:13,700
I would've just pulled back
on the sugar a little bit.

759
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,200
Okay.

760
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,133
So I could have tasted
the cream cheese more.

761
00:31:17,133 --> 00:31:20,733
Thank you, Aidan.
-Thank you. Bye.

762
00:31:20,733 --> 00:31:22,433
-Dang.
-Dang.

763
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:24,700
Dang.

764
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,467
Breakfast desserts,

765
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:33,633
we are brilliant
for thinking this up, man.

766
00:31:33,633 --> 00:31:35,400
This is a good one.
-Yep. My idea.

767
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:38,633
-Let's bring in Cole.
-Yes.

768
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:39,733
Hey, Cole.

769
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,067
Tell me what kind
of waffle cake you made.

770
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:44,067
It's a chocolate waffle.

771
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,433
And then in each layer,

772
00:31:45,433 --> 00:31:49,300
it's chocolate strawberry
cream cheese buttercream

773
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,533
and then a ring
of hazelnut spread.

774
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:55,333
And then there's strawberries,
toasted hazelnuts,

775
00:31:55,333 --> 00:31:58,900
bacon and cinnamon
crunch cereal.

776
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,967
Where's
the kitchen sink?

777
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:03,200
What?

778
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,633
She's just
pulling your leg.

779
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:07,800
Just teasing. Just teasing.
It looks gorgeous.

780
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,067
Thank you.

781
00:32:09,067 --> 00:32:10,933
Like, it looks
professionally made.

782
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:12,233
I love the way
that the chocolate's

783
00:32:12,233 --> 00:32:13,933
coming out
between each layer.

784
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:15,333
And I know Duff
was hoping, "Please,

785
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:17,067
somebody make me
some bacon today."

786
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,500
Let's taste it.

787
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,467
Here. Valerie gets
the pretty piece.

788
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:22,700
-Oh. Thank you, Cole.
-Looking good.

789
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,733
Oh, isn't that pretty?

790
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:30,500
I'm loving
the bacon in there.

791
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,200
It adds that saltiness,
that smokiness in there.

792
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,633
The cake
is cooked perfectly.

793
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:36,600
-Mm-hmm.
-It's really yummy and moist.

794
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,100
And I didn't get much
of the hazelnut.

795
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,800
Hazelnuts happen to be
my favorite nut.

796
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:43,833
I do wish that you had cooked
the bacon a little longer.

797
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,200
Right? You want that bacon
really crispy, right?

798
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,767
But, you know,
I think you got really,

799
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:49,467
really good flavors there.

800
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,633
You made a beautiful cake.
-Thank you.

801
00:32:54,967 --> 00:32:56,233
-Hi, Reese.
-Hi.

802
00:32:56,233 --> 00:32:59,233
I made a carrot cake pancake

803
00:32:59,233 --> 00:33:02,167
with a cream cheese frosting

804
00:33:02,167 --> 00:33:05,267
with my fruit cereal inside.

805
00:33:05,267 --> 00:33:07,367
You got, like,
frosting sticking out.

806
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:09,333
And you got cereal
coming out of there.

807
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:10,600
And there's chocolate
all over.

808
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,467
I mean, it looks like
it's gonna taste good.

809
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:16,333
But it just looks like you
didn't put a lot of effort

810
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,800
into sort of
putting it together.

811
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,533
-Let's taste it.
-Okay.

812
00:33:19,533 --> 00:33:21,600
REESE: Duff, you shouldn't
be able to eat this

813
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,067
'cause you're
the king of waffles.

814
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,167
There you go.
-Why don't I get any?

815
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:29,267
Go play with your waffle team.

816
00:33:33,667 --> 00:33:34,867
It's a lot of nutmeg.

817
00:33:34,867 --> 00:33:36,367
-Oh.
-I do love nutmeg.

818
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,800
But you just went over the edge,
just a little bit.

819
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,900
I added more 'cause
I wanted a good color.

820
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,500
Nutmeg is not
a food coloring.

821
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,933
Whoa.

822
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:50,733
And I tell you, this chocolate
is doing you no favors.

823
00:33:50,733 --> 00:33:52,233
It just doesn't belong.

824
00:33:52,233 --> 00:33:54,967
But your cream cheese
frosting's really good.

825
00:33:54,967 --> 00:33:56,167
Now I like the color

826
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,100
that the fruit cereal
has added here.

827
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,633
-Mm-hmm.
-I don't taste it.

828
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,233
I don't taste the flavor
of the fruit cereal.

829
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:03,367
I just get that extra
little bit of crunch.

830
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:06,067
That is really good
cream cheese frosting.

831
00:34:06,067 --> 00:34:07,467
-Okay.
-Thank you, Reese.

832
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,900
-Thanks, Reese.
-Thank you.

833
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,333
Pancake queen actually gets me.

834
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,200
-How's it going, Kaniyah?
-Good.

835
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,067
That is one
beautiful pancake cake.

836
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,633
I made a rainbow lemon

837
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:25,067
and raspberry pancake cake
with buttercream

838
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:30,767
and raspberry puree
in the middle and fruit cereal.

839
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:34,100
You know what I love?
It looks like Dr. Seuss made it.

840
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,767
-Yes.
-Doesn't it?

841
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:37,500
Yes.
My favorite author.

842
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,067
You know,
really colorful,

843
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:40,467
really kind of wonky
a little bit.

844
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:41,900
But meant to be that way.

845
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:44,167
Thank you. Yay.

846
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:45,933
-Kaniyah, you smiling?
-Yeah.

847
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:47,300
You should be.
This is really cool.

848
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,800
-It's really beautiful.
-Really.

849
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,633
* And they liked
all the colors *

850
00:34:50,633 --> 00:34:53,500
* They liked all the colors,
they liked all the colors *

851
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,067
Proof is
in the pudding.

852
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:56,267
Let's see.

853
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:01,133
You like it?

854
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,533
Duff, do you like it?

855
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:04,267
I do.

856
00:35:04,267 --> 00:35:06,067
I like it a lot.

857
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,400
-Yeah.
-You know what I like?

858
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,100
Your buttercream
is very buttery.

859
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,600
So the butter on top
of a pancake

860
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,833
really makes me think
of breakfast, you know?

861
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:15,467
That's good.

862
00:35:15,467 --> 00:35:17,767
I think you got
too much lemon in here.

863
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,167
I don't.

864
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:20,500
Not at all
'cause you got

865
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,167
all that sweetness
with the raspberry

866
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:24,600
in there and the tartness
with the lemon,

867
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,067
all flavors that are going
really well together.

868
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,800
-Thank you, Val.
-Thank you.

869
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,367
KANIYAH: I'm feeling like
I'm gonna be safe,

870
00:35:31,367 --> 00:35:32,800
even though it was
too much lemon.

871
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,767
But I'm gonna be safe.

872
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,633
Jason!

873
00:35:37,633 --> 00:35:41,733
So for my pancake,
I had just vanilla.

874
00:35:41,733 --> 00:35:43,233
And my buttercream,

875
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:47,833
I have little pieces
of rainbow cereal.

876
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:51,067
And I have a strawberry syrup.

877
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:53,367
I think your pancake
cake looks festive.

878
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,433
It looks
incredibly happy.

879
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:59,100
The joy that you had
in making that

880
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,500
is very evident.

881
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,167
You had a really good time
today, didn't you?

882
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:04,667
-Yeah.
-I mean, look at that face.

883
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:07,933
Why don't you cut into it
and give us a slice?

884
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:09,667
Please like it.
Please like it.

885
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,633
Please like it.
Please like it.

886
00:36:11,633 --> 00:36:12,967
Please like it.
Please like it.

887
00:36:12,967 --> 00:36:15,433
This looks so ridiculous.

888
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,167
-Thank you, Jason.
-You're welcome.

889
00:36:17,167 --> 00:36:21,100
Enjoy your, uh,
2,000 calories.

890
00:36:25,567 --> 00:36:28,867
Jason, the --
the frosting is too sweet.

891
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:30,867
I'm actually grateful that
there's not too much of it

892
00:36:30,867 --> 00:36:32,467
'cause
it's just too sweet.

893
00:36:32,467 --> 00:36:35,633
It's good. It's, like,
a really good vanilla cake.

894
00:36:35,633 --> 00:36:37,133
Okay.

895
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,933
I'm just --
I'm not blown over by it.

896
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,900
I feel you.
I feel you.

897
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,300
I think it's delicious.

898
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:44,933
But it's vanilla.

899
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:47,533
And your cake is dry.

900
00:36:47,533 --> 00:36:49,267
I feel like
your pancake cake

901
00:36:49,267 --> 00:36:50,967
has your spirit
on the outside.

902
00:36:50,967 --> 00:36:53,433
I just don't feel like you gave
it your spirit on the inside.

903
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,433
Darn it.

904
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:57,433
-That's what it's missing.
-Yeah.

905
00:36:57,433 --> 00:37:00,633
Thank you,
queen of pancakes.

906
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:03,067
And goodbye,
king of waffles.

907
00:37:03,067 --> 00:37:06,667
He's funny, man.

908
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,733
I love him.

909
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,767
ANNOUNCER: The winner of
the "Kids Baking Championship"

910
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,467
will receive a sweet
prize package

911
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:20,600
that includes a future story
in "Food Network Magazine"...

912
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,700
Hallelujah!

913
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:25,133
-And...
-$25,000.

914
00:37:29,067 --> 00:37:30,700
Winner is coming.

915
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,667
Okay.

916
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:37,300
It's waffles versus pancakes,
stacked cakes.

917
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,900
Let's go favorite.

918
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,367
Kaniyah.
That was so pretty,

919
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:44,067
that cake, all the colors.

920
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:45,700
She used the fruit
cereal perfectly.

921
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:47,667
It had a little too
much lemon in it, though.

922
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,967
No, no, no, no.
I beg to disagree.

923
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,267
I got to bring up Aidan.

924
00:37:51,267 --> 00:37:53,400
That was really tasty.

925
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,400
-Right? I mean, come on.
-Yeah.

926
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
But I know you weren't
really fond of using

927
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,600
the cinnamon sticks
as a garnish.

928
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,733
Yeah.

929
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:05,333
The waffle cake
that Justice made us

930
00:38:05,333 --> 00:38:08,733
with the orange
was amazing.

931
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:12,067
But I was a little disappointed
in the orange curd.

932
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,200
Audra.

933
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,333
Now Audra had
some problems.

934
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:21,733
It was a mess,
but it tasted good.

935
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,067
It did taste good.

936
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,933
Let's talk about Reese
and his nutmeg.

937
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:29,067
Way too much nutmeg.

938
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,500
I think there's a hole.

939
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,833
I think I can still
taste it on my tongue.

940
00:38:32,833 --> 00:38:35,967
Reese also gave us chocolate
on top of a carrot cake.

941
00:38:35,967 --> 00:38:39,767
He really gave us a good
cream cheese frosting, though.

942
00:38:39,767 --> 00:38:41,067
Ahh!

943
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:44,200
Once we figure out
which side won this,

944
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,667
we have to figure out
who we're sending home

945
00:38:46,667 --> 00:38:48,433
from the losing side.

946
00:38:48,433 --> 00:38:49,600
Oh.

947
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,067
You ready to make
your decision, Valerie?

948
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,200
No! I'm not ready
to make my decision!

949
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,533
Well, I am.
Hurry up, lady!

950
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:57,067
Oh!

951
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,500
The waffle side
should definitely win

952
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,500
because the boys rocked it.

953
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,967
Bakers, only one side

954
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:12,767
of the great
breakfast dessert divide,

955
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,400
waffles or pancakes...

956
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,333
-Pancakes!
-Waffles!

957
00:39:16,333 --> 00:39:19,533
...will be safe
from elimination today.

958
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:20,433
Uh-oh.

959
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:23,800
And the winning
side is...

960
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,833
* Waffles *

961
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:29,300
AUDRA: I don't know
if my teammates can save me.

962
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:32,067
My heart is pounding.

963
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,233

the pancake side.

983
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,333
Now, Duff and I did agree
that there was one baker

984

whose stacked cake
was good enough

985

too much nutmeg

in your carrot cake
creation.

998
00:40:59,367 --> 00:41:01,500
Your stacked cake
was a little messy.

999
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:05,200
And the addition of chocolate
was an odd choice.

Jason, the pancakes
in your enormous

some lemon extract.

in the blast chiller

108

a little bit.

be mushy and sticky

because rose is a nice

00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,800

First, I add some butter
and some sugar and eggs.

122
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:43,267
And I cream that up
in a mixing bowl.

123
00:04:43,267 --> 00:04:45,867
And then I add
my rose-water extract.

124
00:04:45,867 --> 00:04:47,300
As I add my dry ingredients,

125
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,567
I start mixing it by hand,

126
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:50,067
so that it's not overmixed

127
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:52,567
'cause I have more control
over what I'm mixing with.

128
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,567
Ooh.

129
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:55,233
Hey, Valerie.
Did you order something

130
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,967
from twistazon.com?

131
00:04:56,967 --> 00:04:58,967
-I did.
-Huh.

132
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,067
Attention, bakers.

133
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:03,067
Your twist just arrived.

134
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:04,800
-Oh, my God.
-Already?

135
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,433
Oh, my gosh.
It's citrus.

136
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,400
You must
incorporate the flavor

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,433
of one of these
citrus fruits...

138
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:11,600
Ooh.

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,500
...orange, lemon or lime
into your app cookies.

140
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,900
I already have
rose water in there.

141
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,067
Ugh.

142
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,867
There's plenty
for everyone.

143
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:22,200
-There's plenty.
-There's plenty.

144
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,133
AUDRA:
I was already making lemon.

145
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,300
I was already
making it, duh.

146
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,933
-Well, duh.
-Orange.

147
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,533
This is not my station.

148
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:30,900
We can make it harder
for you if you want.

149
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,200
No, thank you.

150
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,267
Mm, I could really go
for a nice cup

151
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:36,667
of fresh-squeezed
orange juice right now.

152
00:05:36,667 --> 00:05:39,500
For my app cookies...

153
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,933
Sugar.

154
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:45,433
...I got Hangry Nerds,
Sugar Scoop and Tummy Rumble.

155
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:48,833
I'm making a vanilla-orange
sugar cookie.

156
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:54,167
I juiced the orange and poured
that into my batter.

157
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:55,600
And I think
that'll do the trick.

158
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,333
Smells like oranges.

159
00:05:57,333 --> 00:06:00,100
What else did we have
that is out now,

160
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,367
and they don't know of?

161
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,933
They'd have to go
see it in a museum.

162
00:06:02,933 --> 00:06:04,167
You know what, Val?

163
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:06,233
I'm gonna go
make you a mixtape.

164
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:08,200
I know.
That used to be, like,

165
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,567
the ultimate
in a romantic gesture...

166
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:12,800
-Oh, man.
-...getting a mixtape.

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,833
Oh, yeah, yeah.

168
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,067
-Hi, Cole.
-Hi.

169
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:16,467
-How's it going?
-Good.

170
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:18,600
Yeah? You got a smile
on your face.

171
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,267
So tell me what apps
you picked.

172
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:22,267
I got Spot-A-Fry,

173
00:06:22,267 --> 00:06:25,800
Noodle Maps
and Cakemaker 1000.

174
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,233
Oh, that sounds like an app
you could come up with.

175
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:30,067
-Yes.
-Have you come up

176
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:31,367
with a story
for each of your app,

177
00:06:31,367 --> 00:06:34,133
like, why you
invented them?

178
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,067
-Um, no, not yet. Nope.
-Not yet?

179
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:37,267
You picked lemons
for your twist?

180
00:06:37,267 --> 00:06:38,433
Yes.

181
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:39,733
Cool. Sounds to me
like the only thing

182
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:41,100
you have to work on
is your stories.

183
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,400
-Yes.
-You got it.

184
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,067
Have fun.
-Thank you.

185
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:47,933
I know that Valerie
loves lemon.

186
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,600
So why not impress her

187
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:52,600
and make her happy
so that I win?

188
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,767
So I'm gonna use lemon
zest and lemon juice.

189
00:06:55,767 --> 00:06:59,067
This lemon is really,
really juicy.

190
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,567
So I add a little extra flour.

191
00:07:01,567 --> 00:07:03,067
There we go.

192
00:07:03,067 --> 00:07:05,067
And it's perfect.

193
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:07,967
You know when you have
perfect sugar-cookie dough,

194
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:09,633
you can touch it.

195
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:13,167
And it won't stick
to your hands.

196
00:07:13,167 --> 00:07:15,600
Hour and 15 minutes
left, bakers.

197
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,100
What? It's already
been 15 minutes?

198
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,933
COLE: Go, bakers, go.

199
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:23,600
I got Pieterest,
Cheesecake Chess

200
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,867
and Fruitcake Ninja.

201
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:28,967
Still stumped on what
my flavoring's gonna be.

202
00:07:28,967 --> 00:07:31,800
I don't bake
sugar cookies that often.

203
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,167
But during the holidays,

204
00:07:33,167 --> 00:07:35,400
they're one of my
favorite treats of all time,

205
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,633
especially the super chewy ones.

206
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:42,400
Why don't I make
an orange sugar cookie?

207
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,367
You're making orange
sugar cookies?

208
00:07:44,367 --> 00:07:46,100
-Yeah.
-That's what I'm doing.

209
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,900
And the icons that
I have are Snackchat,

210
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,167
Buttercream Bingo and Crumbtown.

211
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:53,067
-Hi, Kaniyah.
-Hello.

212
00:07:53,067 --> 00:07:54,367
What you making?

213
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,600
I am making
a orange sugar cookie.

214
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,900
Or what are you making
besides a mess?

215
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,800
What is going on
back here?

216
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,167
I have no clue.

217
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:03,633
I'm the Cookie Monster.

218
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:05,733
Okay. So you're making
an orange sugar cookie.

219
00:08:05,733 --> 00:08:07,733
-Yeah.
-Cool, man.

220
00:08:07,733 --> 00:08:09,733
Jason, do you have
the orange extract?

221
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:10,900
Uh, yeah, right there.
You can have it.

222
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,300
Thank you.

223
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,767
JUSTICE: Forget rose.
Now I'm doing orange

224
00:08:14,767 --> 00:08:16,133
because I want it to taste

225
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:19,333
like the oranges off
of my orange tree.

226
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,200
I don't want to have a lot
of water in my dough.

227
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,267
So I just put a dash
of juice in there.

228
00:08:23,267 --> 00:08:25,400
But mostly,
I'll put orange extract.

229
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,533
And then I make
an orange buttercream

230
00:08:27,533 --> 00:08:30,100
so that it'll mask
the rose flavor

231
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,633
and let the orange shine.

232
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,467
How's your cookies
going, Justice?

233
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,433
-Good. How 'bout you?
-Pretty good.

234
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:41,800
Are yours already
in the oven?

235
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,900
Nope. Are yours?

236
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,133
Uh, I'm going to put them
in the oven very shortly.

237
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:48,500
Did you put 'em
in the blast chiller

238
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,833
to cool off?

239
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,200
Before you put them
in the oven,

240
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,333
you have to put them
in the blast chiller.

241
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,067
I don't think so.

242
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:57,967
Okay.

243
00:08:57,967 --> 00:09:01,200
I've never done it
that way before.

244
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,867
JASON: Oh, boy. No.

245
00:09:04,867 --> 00:09:06,533
This doesn't feel right.

246
00:09:06,533 --> 00:09:07,467
Ah.

247
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,533
Check out Jason.

248
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:10,633
He is struggling
to get those cookies

249
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,767
off his cutting board.

250
00:09:11,767 --> 00:09:13,367
They're mis-shapened apps.

251
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:15,633
I mean, he could scrape
all those cookies off,

252
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:17,800
reform the dough
and reroll it.

253
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,933
But then they're gonna start
getting really tough.

254
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:22,300
It'll be okay.
It'll be fine.

255
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,633
I made a few extra cookies.

256
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:26,267
If I have a few duds,

257
00:09:26,267 --> 00:09:28,333
I'll have spare cookies
just in case.

258
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:31,067
I start my cookies in the oven.

259
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,467
Wait, who else is making orange?

260
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:34,567
Jason is also
making orange.

261
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,667
Okay.
I'm not doing orange.

262
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:38,333
Limes it is.

263
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,333
I want to be different
with my sugar cookies.

264
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:43,133
And no one else picked lime.

265
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,067
I'm just gonna
add zest and juice.

266
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:48,467
And I think that'll really pop.

267
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:51,067
Not enough.
I taste my dough.

268
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:53,767
And there's no lime flavor.

269
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,633
So I need to add more juice.

270
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:59,067
I, like, don't
taste any lime.

271
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:01,433
Okay. According
to my cookie timer,

272
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:03,933
you have
1 hour left, bakers.

273
00:10:03,933 --> 00:10:05,400
-Oh, boy.
-Oh, my gosh.

274
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,300
People are already
rolling out their dough.

275
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,833
I'm adding a final dash of lime.

276
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,200
Oh, gosh.

277
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,567
Oh, that's really,
really kind of wet.

278
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:18,133
If my dough's too wet,
it probably won't bake properly.

279
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,067
It'll probably look weird.

280
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:22,500
Oh, my gosh.
This is a disaster.

281
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,067
I don't have enough time
to start all over.

282
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:34,000
You have 1 hour left,
bakers.

283
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,400
-Oh, boy.
-For real?

284
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,433
Oh, my gosh.
This is a disaster.

285
00:10:38,433 --> 00:10:42,400
We are expecting amazing
mobile app cookies.

286
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,467
Ooh, that's really,
really kind of wet.

287
00:10:45,467 --> 00:10:48,367
The twist is we have
to incorporate a citrus flavor.

288
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:51,533
And I've splashed in maybe
about 1/2 cup,

289
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:53,433
at this point, of lime juice.

290
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,500
Gosh.
What am I gonna do?

291
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,167
Hey, remember what happens
when you add

292
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,133
too much liquid
to something,

293
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:01,067
and you throw off
the ratio.

294
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,600
Baking is science.

295
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:05,967
Oh. [ Gasps ]
Wait a second.

296
00:11:05,967 --> 00:11:07,367
Okay.

297
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,933
Just come together.

298
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:11,567
Please. Please.
Please, work.

299
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:14,167
So I add a little
extra flour

300
00:11:14,167 --> 00:11:15,833
to help balance
out all that juice.

301
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,367
You know what?
The flour's gonna help it.

302
00:11:18,367 --> 00:11:20,533
Finally, it looks okay enough.

303
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:23,233
And I need to get
this rolled out fast.

304
00:11:23,233 --> 00:11:24,700
I've had better days.

305
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,967
What am I doing?

306
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,400
-Rotary phone.
-Right.

307
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,700
They don't know
what a rotary phone is.

308
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,867
Oh, yeah.
They see one of these,

309
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,233
they're like, "Uh, I don't..."
-What do you do with that?

310
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:34,467
You always hated when
your numbers were,

311
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:35,800
like, nines
or zeroes in it

312
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,933
because it took longer.

313
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,367
Come on.

314
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,267
-How are you doing, Kaniyah?
-Good.

315
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:43,133
It's time to roll out
my sugar-cookie dough.

316
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,067
Okay. Just...

317
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:49,967
As I'm rolling,
I look down and...

318
00:11:49,967 --> 00:11:52,700
Oh, snap.
I have me an orange.

319
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,267
Oops.
No.

320
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:57,467
I didn't add my orange.

321
00:11:57,467 --> 00:12:00,067
I cannot believe
I forgot the orange.

322
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:03,733
Oopsies. So I'm squeezing
orange juice into the batter.

323
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:07,333
So then I have to put
more flour up there.

324
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:10,467
And I roll it out again.

325
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:12,167
Bro.

326
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,933
Kaniyah just keeps
rolling out her dough

327
00:12:13,933 --> 00:12:15,267
and rolling out her dough.

328
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:16,967
The thing about, like,
a sugar-cookie dough,

329
00:12:16,967 --> 00:12:18,233
you need to have
a light touch with it.

330
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,600
So it comes out
really tender.

331
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,267
Yeah. You want a light,
crispy sugar cookie.

332
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:25,600
Now, 40 decorations.

333
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,300
All right, bakers.
It sounded pretty easy

334
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,767
when we first told you
this challenge.

335
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,067
-No, it didn't.
-How's it going now?

336
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,333
Still good.
No pressure.

337
00:12:33,333 --> 00:12:35,133
I like your attitude,
Kaniyah.

338
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:37,433
You really have
to app-ply yourself

339
00:12:37,433 --> 00:12:39,367
if you want
to impress us.

340
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,667
Oh, God.

341
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:42,333
Is there an app
for going back in time,

342
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:44,700
so I didn't hear
that horrible joke?

343
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,700
Let's come up with one.

344
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,967
COLE: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

345
00:12:49,967 --> 00:12:51,833
When sugar cookies
are in the oven,

346
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,300
tend to spread.

347
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,400
A perfectionist
cannot have that.

348
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,533
So I'm only doing
six on each sheet,

349
00:12:59,533 --> 00:13:02,867
so that they're not
even close to touching.

350
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,133
What you making
over there?

351
00:13:04,133 --> 00:13:06,467
Lemon rose-water glaze.

352
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:09,467
-That sounds delicious.
-I hope.

353
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:12,833
I'm gonna make my glaze
by combining powdered sugar,

354
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,833
milk and lemon zest.

355
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,500
I want to use rose water

356
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,133
because I want to wow the judges
with unique flavors.

357
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,433
Is that rose water
at Cole's station?

358
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,267
It's a tricky little
ingredient to get right.

359
00:13:25,267 --> 00:13:28,167
-Yes, it is.
-Too much is too much.

360
00:13:28,167 --> 00:13:30,667
It's like drinking
perfume.

361
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:31,600
Hmm.

362
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,367
JUSTICE: While my cookies
are in the oven,

363
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:36,633
I really need to start
on my fondantwork for the apps.

364
00:13:36,633 --> 00:13:37,800
If you're using fondant,

365
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:40,233
you really always want
to make it really thin

366
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,733
'cause fondant's not
the best-tasting thing.

367
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:45,800
It's more of a decoration
not a flavor.

368
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,133
Okay. Perfect.

369
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,800
I finally get
my dough rolled out.

370
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,067
But when I cut them,
some were really thin

371
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,967
and then some are really thick.

372
00:13:54,967 --> 00:13:57,167
Oh, that's way too thick.

373
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:59,800
And a little messier
than I would like.

374
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,867
Ugh. That one's just a fail.

375
00:14:01,867 --> 00:14:04,100
Audra's been working
on her dough for a long time.

376
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:06,567
She has got to get
that in the oven.

377
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,867
I really wanted to give a pop
to my sugar cookies.

378
00:14:08,867 --> 00:14:11,233
So I'm adding extra salt.

379
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:14,200
And I just hope
it's not too salty.

380
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,567
45 minutes left, bakers.

381
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:19,400
-Ah.
-A lot of armwork, Mommy.

382
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:24,067
Make a cookie that will
whet our app-etites.

383
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,200
Again, with the puns.

384
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,933
-Don't stop the puns ever.
-Oh, I didn't hear it.

385
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:29,400
-Keep 'em coming.
-Tell me the pun.

386
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,500
Puns are a sign
of genius, Jason.

387
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,567
-Oh, my...
-Oh, boy.

388
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:41,267
I smell something burning.

389
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:43,067
-Oh, no. Wait.
-I do too.

390
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:44,200
I just put mine in.

391
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:49,067
Where's my...timer anyways?

392
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:51,833
Oh. I was so busy
on this glaze,

393
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,800
I forgot about my cookies.

394
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,633
Oh, no.

395
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:58,200
No. Please,
no burned cookies.

396
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,667
-You burnt your cookies?
-This is terrible.

397
00:15:00,667 --> 00:15:02,467
Some of them.
This is an absolute disaster.

398
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,233
JASON:
No, please, no burned cookies.

399
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:11,767
You burnt your cookies?

400
00:15:11,767 --> 00:15:14,400
JASON: Some of them.

401
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,333
Okay, good, they're soft.

402
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,400
30 minutes left, bakers.

403
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,300
Got to go. Got to go.
Got to go. Got to go. Got to go.

404
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,667
A dozen sugar
cookies with

405
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:26,067
three different app designs
with a citrus twist.

406
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,667
Smells like lime.

407
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:29,700
-This is so hard.
-They're soft still.

408
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,400
They're not, like,
completely burned.

409
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,200
Thankfully, my cookies
are nice and soft.

410
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,767
So I throw 'em
in the blast chiller,

411
00:15:35,767 --> 00:15:38,567
so they don't cook anymore.

412
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,067
Now I have to figure out
what I'm gonna do

413
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,967
with my app designs.

414
00:15:41,967 --> 00:15:44,700
Angry Nerds...

415
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,233
Rumble...

416
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:49,733
Sugar Scoop...

417
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:51,133
I knew it was gonna be hard.

418
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:55,067
But I didn't think
it would be this hard.

419
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,567
What am I even doing?

420
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,233
JUSTICE:
It's time to decorate.

421
00:15:59,233 --> 00:16:01,733
Each app has
its own different job.

422
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:05,233
And for each one, it's gonna
have its own unique design.

423
00:16:05,233 --> 00:16:08,133
For Graham Hacker,
I cut rectangles.

424
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,333
So it looks like
a graham cracker.

425
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,967
And I put little dots in it.

426
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:12,500
I get the edible marker.

427
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:17,633
And I draw on his sunglasses
like evil graham cracker.

428
00:16:17,633 --> 00:16:20,167
Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha.

429
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:24,433
Eclairiscope is a gossip news
app for eclairs.

430
00:16:24,433 --> 00:16:27,533
I think I'll just do
a eclair with a paper

431
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:30,200
running down it, kind of
like the eclair is a scroll.

432
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:34,067
And I'm doing a cheese house
for Parmville.

433
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:35,867
Decorate this cookie.

434
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,500
For my decorations,

435
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm going to use fondant
on fondant and on fondant.

436
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,567
Doesn't taste good,
but it looks pretty.

437
00:16:44,567 --> 00:16:46,367
I got this.

438
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:49,533
I'm gonna decorate Snackchat
by spray-painting it yellow

439
00:16:49,533 --> 00:16:51,367
and putting a fondant
cookie on top.

440
00:16:51,367 --> 00:16:54,367
Yes.
Now Buttercream Bingo.

441
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:57,433
For the Buttercream Bingo,
I'm gonna use white fondant.

442
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,400
And I'll draw on it
with edible markers

443
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,067
to make it look
like a bingo board.

444
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,667
Bingo, bingo, bingo.

445
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:06,167
Crumbtown, I'm gonna
spray-paint it blue

446
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,900
and crush up cookies
and put 'em on top.

447
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,133
Hallelujah.

448
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:10,833
24 minutes left.

449
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,667
For real?

450
00:17:12,667 --> 00:17:14,533
COLE: I have to make
a Spot-a-Fry app,

451
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:18,133
a Noodle Maps app
and a Cakemaker 1000 app.

452
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,733
That -- that's a lot.

453
00:17:19,733 --> 00:17:24,167
I'm dipping each cookie
in a lemon rose-water glaze.

454
00:17:24,167 --> 00:17:25,767
And then I'm just gonna airbrush

455
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:27,967
and then do decorations
on top of that.

456
00:17:27,967 --> 00:17:30,600
So I have to work quickly.

457
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:33,667
First, I'm gonna airbrush
four cookies red

458
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:38,067
and then four cookies purple
and then four cookies blue.

459
00:17:38,067 --> 00:17:41,900
Noodle Maps -- The streets
are gonna be, like, spaghetti.

460
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,267
I'm using a toothpick.

461
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,167
And I'm indenting
all the different streets

462
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:48,500
for the yellow to fall in.

463
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,200
JASON:
Cole, that is genius.

464
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,900
Cakemaker 1000 --
very self-explanatory.

465
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,733
It's just gonna be a cake
on top that I can decorate.

466
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:03,300
And then Spot-a-Fry is gonna
have fries on the front.

467
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,433
And I think that'd look really,
really slick.

468
00:18:07,433 --> 00:18:09,300
AUDRA: So my cookies
are out of the oven.

469
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,500
And I go to lift one off.

470
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,067
Oh, my God. Those are raw.
These are raw.

471
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:15,667
15 minutes left, bakers.

472
00:18:15,667 --> 00:18:17,367
You got 15 minutes.

473
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:19,167
So I have to get them
back in the oven.

474
00:18:19,167 --> 00:18:22,400
And I have no idea if I'm gonna
have enough time to bake them.

475
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,767
Oh, gosh.

476
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:25,633
Ooh, looking good.

477
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:27,533
My cookies don't need to bake
for that long

478
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:30,100
because I like my sugar
cookies really chewy

479
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,667
and super soft.

480
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:34,367
Aidan just pulled his cookies
out of the oven.

481
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,400
They look
pretty blond to me.

482
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,333
And that's a nice way
of saying,

483
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,633
"I don't think
they're done."

484
00:18:38,633 --> 00:18:41,067
Oh, the sugar cookies
look delicious.

485
00:18:41,067 --> 00:18:42,433
I don't really like fondant.

486
00:18:42,433 --> 00:18:45,367
But it will work
in this situation the best.

487
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:49,200
I don't want, like, too big
of a thick slab of fondant.

488
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,833
For my Cheesecake Chess,

489
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,533
I have to cut out each of
the little squares of fondant

490
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:54,600
for the chessboard

491
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,500
and just apply
a little bit of water

492
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,867
to each one to help it stick.

493
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:02,300
And I have little blueberries
and strawberries on each end.

494
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,400
Strawberries versus blueberries.

495
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,067
For my Fruitcake Ninja,

496
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:08,767
I'm going to have
a ninja standing there.

497
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:12,533
Awesome. And I'm gonna have
the evil fruitcakes next to him.

498
00:19:12,533 --> 00:19:14,700
Just keep drawing.
Just keep drawing.

499
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,333
And for my Pieterest,
I'm going to have a big pie

500
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,800
with some fruits on the edges --

501
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,067
some cherries, some lemons.

502
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,833
Kaniyah, yours looks so good.

503
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:27,167
KANIYAH: Thank you.

504
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,700
My Snackchat cookies
look really cool,

505
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,900
but it's too much fondant.

506
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,633
See what happens if I do this.

507
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:35,700
So why not make it
with a real cookie?

508
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,900
Quick.

509
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,133
10 minutes!

510
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:39,833
Okay.

511
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,500
Come on, cookies.
Come on. Come on, cookies.

512
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,200
Ugh, just don't want to cook.

513
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,767
I need to start decorating.

514
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:48,567
JASON: Ugh!

515
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,767
I'm gonna have, like,
a white background.

516
00:19:50,767 --> 00:19:53,733
I'm just using
a regular vanilla glaze

517
00:19:53,733 --> 00:19:56,367
and making different colors
for my artwork.

518
00:19:56,367 --> 00:19:58,067
Usually, most apps
just have, like,

519
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,567
a picture or a symbol on it.

520
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:01,133
Hangry Herd.
Hangry Nerds.

521
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,833
Hangry Nerds.

522
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:05,100
This glaze is thick.

523
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:12,067
There we go.

524
00:20:12,067 --> 00:20:14,767
I'm trying to decorate
with this glaze.

525
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,600
But it's way too sloppy.

526
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,967
What! I don't even
know what that is.

527
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:22,667
Nerd lump things.

528
00:20:22,667 --> 00:20:23,900
Uh, Sugar Scoop.

529
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,633
Silver Scoop.

530
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,367
Maybe just, like,
a scoop with sugar in it.

531
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:31,333
Much better, kind of.

532
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,467
My Tummy Rumble app,

533
00:20:33,467 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm having a sandwich
on the top.

534
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,967
Only eat bread...

535
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:42,233
Want tomatoes in my sandwich.

536
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,700
Oh, my gosh.

537
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,800
This is an absolute mess.

538
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,167
My sandwich looks kind
of like a sandwich.

539
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,133
Well...

540
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,333
But not really.

541
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,467
All right, bakers.
Five minutes left.

542
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:00,567
So hurry app.

543
00:21:00,567 --> 00:21:01,833
I have to get
these out and cooling.

544
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:05,100
Oh, no.

545
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,500
God, I left them
in too long.

546
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,533
Some of my cookies
are different sizes.

547
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:14,400
The thin ones
are brown and ugly.

548
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,433
This really upsets me.

549
00:21:16,433 --> 00:21:17,800
No.

550
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:21,433
I have to get started on
some decorations for my cookies.

551
00:21:21,433 --> 00:21:23,133
Gonna make the most
of these ones

552
00:21:23,133 --> 00:21:24,467
that, you know, aren't burnt.

553
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:28,167
I'm going to start
with my Dessert Craft.

554
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,533
I grab some vanilla fondant.

555
00:21:30,533 --> 00:21:33,067
I'm going to try
and cut out some people.

556
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:37,567
And I see a flower
cookie cutter.

557
00:21:37,567 --> 00:21:40,700
Stretch out the legs
a little bit.

558
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,100
Boom, person.

559
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,967
kind of looks like
a human with really,

560
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:47,333
really fat hands and really,
really fat legs but, you know.

561
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,867
I'm gonna put something
in his hand.

562
00:21:49,867 --> 00:21:51,767
I draw a cake on there.

563
00:21:51,767 --> 00:21:56,700
And I grab a ton of sprinkles
to decorate my cake.

564
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
For my Clash of Carbs,

565
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,467
it's basically
a food-fight game.

566
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,467
I pipe a little person on it.

567
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,400
And I'm just, like,
sticking candy on it.

568
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
And it looks like food.

569
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,533
Oh, no. I still have to do
my Pastry Chef Go.

570
00:22:12,533 --> 00:22:14,167
One minute.

571
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:17,533
No. I'm not gonna finish.

572
00:22:17,533 --> 00:22:19,067
Audra,
are you gonna finish?

573
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:21,333
-Probably not.
-Go, go, go.

574
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,600
JASON: This is terrible.

575
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,800
30 seconds, bakers.
30 seconds.

576
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,167
Get 'em on the plate.

577
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:27,767
Hustle, hustle,
hustle, hustle.

578
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,900
BOTH: 10...9...8...

579
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,833
7...6...5...4...3...2...1.

580
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,067
-Oh, my God.
-Hands up.

581
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,667
Audra, you about gave me
a heart attack.

582
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,733
Wait for it.
Wait for it.

583
00:22:43,733 --> 00:22:46,633
App-plause.

584
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:49,200
I look down
at my three app cookies.

585
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,733
And they look so messy.

586
00:22:53,467 --> 00:22:55,700
ANNOUNCER: Ordinary sugar
cookies, hit the send button.

587
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,500
A sweet mobile text
right after this.

588
00:23:06,233 --> 00:23:08,833
ANNOUNCER: How to make
text-message cookies.

589
00:23:08,833 --> 00:23:11,467
Gather together flour,
sugar-cookie dough,

590
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:14,067
a rolling pin,
a pizza cutter

591
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:16,667
and an assortment
of colored frostings.

592
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,067
Flour your surface.

593
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:21,633
Roll out your dough.

594
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,233
Cut the cookies
into rectangles and bake.

595
00:23:25,233 --> 00:23:28,133
Frost them with a background
color and let dry.

596
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:30,167
Then pipe on text boxes

597
00:23:30,167 --> 00:23:32,133
and a whole colorful
conversation.

598
00:23:32,133 --> 00:23:34,333
Emoticons never tasted so sweet.

599
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:35,733
For more fun treats like this,

600
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:39,133
visit
foodnetwork.com/kidsbaking.

601
00:23:39,133 --> 00:23:41,333
Make-believe
food app cookies.

602
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,433
This was pretty cool,
right?

603
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,833
VALERIE: I love this one.

604
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,167
You want to bring in
Cole?

605
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:49,300
All right. Hey, Cole.
-Mm-hmm?

606
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,067
Cole, so what
were your apps?

607
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,100
I had Spot-A-Fry,

608
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,867
Noodle Maps and Cakemaker 1000.

609
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:00,767
What do each
of those apps do?

610
00:24:00,767 --> 00:24:04,667
Cakemaker 1000 --
The mean Duff walks in.

611
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:06,333
-Is that how I walk?
-And he tries to...

612
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:09,367
Yeah. He tries to, like,
smash your cake.

613
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,367
So you have to, like,
fight him off.

614
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,667
-So it's a game app.
-Yes.

615
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:15,133
-Okay.
-A game.

616
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:17,700
Yeah, I'm like
the old bad guy.

617
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,767
All righty, then.

618
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,533
Cole, I love the way
that these are decorated.

619
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,567
Absolutely.
But, you know, I got to say,

620
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,900
I could not tell
that that was a 1000.

621
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,233
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

622
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:29,133
You probably
would have done better

623
00:24:29,133 --> 00:24:31,767
if you used
a little bit thicker

624
00:24:31,767 --> 00:24:34,767
consistency of frosting
for the details.

625
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,567
And they wouldn't have
spread out as much.

626
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,367
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, what's the next one?

627
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:42,633
For Noodle Maps,
the noodles in Noodle Town

628
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:46,300
are all running as fast
as they can

629
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,467
to go in their broth.

630
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,200
If they don't get there in time,

631
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,667
they'll dry out and die.

632
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,067
He's got stories.

633
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,500
Awesome.

634
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,700
The Noodle Map app
is really cool-looking.

635
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,067
It looks like a map.
I like it, man.

636
00:25:04,067 --> 00:25:06,233
And in Spot-A-Fry,

637
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:10,767
the fries are fighting
to get to the ketchup.

638
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:15,700
But if, like, one of the fries
gets cut in half,

639
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,867
the mustard comes out.

640
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:18,100
And they die.

641
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,667
Okay.
I got to tell you.

642
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:21,867
I just -- I love
the different colors you chose.

643
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:24,633
That really looks like
a thing of fries to me.

644
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:25,833
Well done.

645
00:25:25,833 --> 00:25:28,933
Bon app-etite.

646
00:25:28,933 --> 00:25:30,500
Ha ha.

647
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,300
Well, they got
beautiful color on 'em.

648
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,567
So what kind of cookies
did you make and frosting?

649
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:38,700
A lemon sugar cookie
with a lemon rose-water glaze.

650
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:42,100
Hmm, Cole.

651
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,167
Have you ever
used rose water before?

652
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,500
When you use it right,
it's just, like, a hint.

653
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,633
When you use too much,
it gets very perfumy.

654
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,167
I think you got a little
too much in here.

655
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:55,167
The glaze has that
really nice lemon flavor,

656
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:58,167
but it's overshadowed
by rose water.

657
00:25:58,167 --> 00:26:00,133
Excellent
sugar cookie, though.

658
00:26:00,133 --> 00:26:02,467
The cookie is nice
and crunchy and crisp.

659
00:26:02,467 --> 00:26:05,067
[ Deep voice ]
Good job, Cole.

660
00:26:05,067 --> 00:26:06,700
[ Deep voice ]
Thank you.

661
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,100
-Thank you, Cole.
-[ Normal voice ] Thank you.

662
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,933
Not a favorite flavor
of mine.

663
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:13,533
Yeah, rose water,
it's tough.

664
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,400
How's it going, Audra?
-Good.

665
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,167
You want to tell us
what your cookies were today,

666
00:26:19,167 --> 00:26:21,133
what your apps were
and your stories?

667
00:26:21,133 --> 00:26:23,067
For Clash of Carbs,

668
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:25,567
it's kind of like
a food-fight game.

669
00:26:25,567 --> 00:26:30,333
So you just, like,
throw food at people.

670
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:31,667
I love food fights.

671
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,167
Oh, no. I'm thinking
that's the middle one.

672
00:26:34,167 --> 00:26:35,933
Is that Clash of Carbs?

673
00:26:35,933 --> 00:26:37,633
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

674
00:26:37,633 --> 00:26:39,433
Have you ever been
in a food fight?

675
00:26:39,433 --> 00:26:41,067
One time, I threw
a fry at someone.

676
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:43,133
But that doesn't really count.

677
00:26:43,133 --> 00:26:44,500
-A fry?
-Yeah.

678
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,533
So which ones
are these two?

679
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,967
The one with
the flower-looking thingy,

680
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,600
that's Dessert Craft.

681
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,533
That's supposed to be a human,
by the way.

682
00:26:53,533 --> 00:26:56,067
And then he's holding a little
birthday cake in his hand.

683
00:26:56,067 --> 00:26:59,333
It's abstract,
app-stract.

684
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,867
Okay. Well, what do you do
in this game?

685
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:05,700
You can bake anything you want,

686
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,467
but you have to find
the resources for it.

687
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:10,067
You have to find
your baking ingredients?

688
00:27:10,067 --> 00:27:11,267
-Yeah.
-Okay.

689
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:14,100
And this one is...
-Pastry Chef Go.

690
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:16,667
You are the culinary teacher.

691
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:20,333
And whoever is teaching
just runs away.

692
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:23,300
And you have to catch them.

693
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,067
Sounds like fun.

694
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,067
I guess
I'm having a hard time

695
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,567
figuring out
which app is which.

696
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,067
I mean, I just don't know
that these tell me

697
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,733
what I'm about
to click into.

698
00:27:30,733 --> 00:27:33,500
What happened with your
time management today?

699
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,667
I felt like I was moving fast.

700
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:38,067
But I guess I went slow.

701
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,600
[ Both laugh ]

702
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,233
Uh, what flavor cookies
did you pick?

703
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:44,633
A lemon cookie,

704
00:27:44,633 --> 00:27:47,633
and then I did
a vanilla frosting.

705
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:51,133
-Did you put salt in there?
-Depends. Is it too salty?

706
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:57,067
I'm tasting salt
with the sugar.

707
00:27:57,067 --> 00:27:59,100
It's very pleasing
to my palate.

708
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:01,567
Oh, well, yeah. I did.

709
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:03,233
Not the prettiest
cookies in the world,

710
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:04,733
but they're really delicious.
-Thank you.

711
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,633
Um, I could use
a little bit more lemon.

712
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,133
I'm not getting
a whole bunch.

713
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:10,133
-Subtle.
-Thanks, Audra.

714
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:11,633
-Thanks, Audra.
-Thank you.

715
00:28:11,633 --> 00:28:14,067
You can really taste
the salt on the crispy one.

716
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,867
-Yeah.
-But they're a mess.

717

718
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,367
Did you have a good day?

Yeah, I got some
new apps on my phone.

Oh, cool. Tell me about 'em.
What'd you get?

00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,300
The Tummy Rumble app
is the sandwich.

-Are you sure that's a sandwich?
-I tried...

723
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:36,333
It's kind of hard
to decorate with glaze.

724
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:37,467
That looks more
like a meatball

725
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,433
with marinara
and parsley on it.

726
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:40,933
-I'm good with a meatball.
-Okay.

Tummy Rumble do?

if you had the story

the decorating a little bit.

are your cookies?

getting any orange?

and stormy night,

must taste so much

better than normal
graham crackers."

And why was he Russian?

806
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,867
Because it sounds more evil.

807
00:31:39,867 --> 00:31:41,333
Okay. All right.

808
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,067
And the lightning struck
his building.

809
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,700
And then all
his potions exploded.

810
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,500
And they all went
over graham cracker.

811
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:51,067
And he grew and grew
into Graham Hacker.

812
00:31:51,067 --> 00:31:52,733
Wow. Okay.
All right.

Graham Hacker, you know,
he kind of looks...

816
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,600
-Yep.
-...like a jerk, you know?

817
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:03,067
He looks like, I don't want
nothing to do with that guy.

818
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,933
-Okay.
-Wow.

819
00:32:04,933 --> 00:32:07,600
Wa-ha-ha-ha-ha.

820
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,200
I am the graham cracker.

821
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,633
I think your
presentation is great.

822
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:13,533
-Nice thin fondant.
-They look tight, clean.

823
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:16,400
Maybe a little issue
on the vividness of the color

824
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,900
because when you look
at your phone

825
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,200
with the apps on it,

826
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,067
all of them have
vibrant colors on it.

827
00:32:21,067 --> 00:32:23,067
These are
a little subdued.

828
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,533
Let's eat this cookie.

829
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:26,767
Mm.

830
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,400
Tell us
about your flavor.

831
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,300
I did an orange sugar cookie
with an orange buttercream.

832
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:34,233
It's all over me.

833
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,700
That's a really good sign,
by the way.

834
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,100
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

835
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,700
You did not beat
your dough up, really tender.

836
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,400
I can taste the orange.
-Yeah, I really like it.

837
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,067
It's nice and subtle
in the buttercream.

838
00:32:43,067 --> 00:32:45,067
It just layers
on that orange flavor.

839
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:46,433
-Good job, man.
-Thank you.

840
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:48,700
-All right.
-It's an app.

841
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,767
It needs to be more colorful.
-Totally. No, I -- I agree.

842
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:53,833
But definitely
best flavor.

843
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,733
-What's up, Kaniyah?
-'Sup.

844
00:32:55,733 --> 00:32:58,700
Tell me about your app cookies.
What happens in Crumbtown?

845
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:03,100
This crumb guy is running across
all these booby traps.

846
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,933
And if he steps
on a booby trap,

847
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:07,600
he gets eaten by a crumb dragon.

848
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,333
I -- I want to meet
a crumb dragon.

849
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,333
Me too.
I feel like
that'd be a lot of fun.

850
00:33:11,333 --> 00:33:12,667
I like the crumbs on it.

851
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:14,067
You know, very inventive
use of crumbs.

852
00:33:14,067 --> 00:33:15,333
Mm-hmm.

853
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,800
Now, what
about Buttercream Bingo?

854
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:21,133
In Buttercream Bingo,
the old lady cakes

855
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,767
are fighting over

856
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:25,333
which one could get iced first

857
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:27,067
and then have bingo.

858
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,467
All right.
All right.

859
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,233
And bingo
looks like bingo.

860
00:33:30,233 --> 00:33:32,200
I even put Free
in the middle of it.

861
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,200
"That's a bingo."

862
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,067
And then Snackchat.

863
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:40,733
This cookie tries
to attack this person.

864
00:33:40,733 --> 00:33:44,667
And the person's like, "No!
Let's talk this out."

865
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,133
You know what?
I really like your stories.

866
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,600
I think they're --
they're really fun.

867
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,133
I love the Snackchat cookie
'cause it's like a cookie

868
00:33:54,133 --> 00:33:57,300
used as a decoration
on another cookie.

869
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,767
And I think
that's amazing.

870
00:33:58,767 --> 00:34:00,533
I'm wondering why
there's no buttercream

871
00:34:00,533 --> 00:34:02,133
or anything to hold
your fondant down.

872
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:03,467
But here's the deal.
I'm glad it's off

873
00:34:03,467 --> 00:34:05,700
because that's really
super thick fondant,

874
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:09,567
not really something
I want to bite into.

875
00:34:09,567 --> 00:34:10,700
Mm.

876
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,733
That's a really
crunchy cookie.

877
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,167
It's chewy and crunchy.

878
00:34:15,167 --> 00:34:17,933
Kaniyah, I think your dough
got a little overworked.

879
00:34:17,933 --> 00:34:20,100
And that's why they're crunchy
and chewy at the same time.

880
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,367
They got a little tough.

881
00:34:21,367 --> 00:34:23,100
Just like you,
they're a little tough.

882
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,633
You know what I mean?

883
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:28,400
What did you use
for your citrus twist?

884
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,700
-Orange.
-I do taste some orange.

885
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,467
So that's a good sign.

886
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:35,300
There's something missing,
though. What is that?

887
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,500
Kind of, you know what it
tastes like is a, like,

888
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,267
a fortune cookie.
-What?

889
00:34:38,267 --> 00:34:41,300
You know, there's just
kind of no flavor.

890
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,400
All right, Kaniyah. Thank you.
-Thank you, Kaniyah.

891
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,067
-You're welcome.
-Just got really worked.

892
00:34:46,067 --> 00:34:47,167
Okay.

893
00:34:49,233 --> 00:34:50,933
-How's it going, Aidan?
-Good.

894
00:34:50,933 --> 00:34:53,867
Tell us about your cookies
and what your apps were.

895
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:55,467
The Cheesecake Chess

896
00:34:55,467 --> 00:34:58,267
is strawberries
versus blueberries

897
00:34:58,267 --> 00:35:00,167
battling it out in chess

898
00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:01,467
so that they can be
on the cheesecake.

899
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,300
That sounds like
a fun game.

900
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,900
Okay.

901
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:09,067
That's a really
thick fondant

902
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:11,300
that's bigger
than your cookie.

903
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,933
Sorry.

904
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:16,133
What's the next app?

905
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:18,700
Fruitcake Ninja is
about the Emperor

906
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:23,333
banished the fruitcakes
down below in a deep dungeon.

907
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:27,100
But now the fruitcakes
are escaping.

908
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:29,333
And he's sending his lead ninja

909
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:34,067
to save the whole country
from fruitcakes.

910
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:39,300
The ninja,
I know that's a guy

911
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,467
because the guy on there
doing something.

912
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:43,567
Uh, maybe it's
a dog-walking app.

913
00:35:43,567 --> 00:35:45,100
I don't know.

914
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,633
And this one is...

915
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:51,767
Pieterest is the ultimate pie
network for grandmothers.

916
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:54,300
And they share pie ideas.

917
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:58,300
And they have pie
conversations, pie charts.

918
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:01,733
-Love your stories.
-The stories are really good.

919
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:04,067
Thanks.

920
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,367
But, you know, I got to say
with your decorations,

921
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,667
I really expected
more from you.

922
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,133
Yeah, not my best day.

923
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,867
I'm a little concerned
with the doneness

924
00:36:11,867 --> 00:36:13,400
of your cookie, too.

925
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
They seem really,
really blond.

926
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,900
What?

927
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,167
I do like chewy sugar cookies.

928
00:36:20,167 --> 00:36:21,700
Okay. Good to know.

929
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,500
I would rather have a chewy
one than a crispy one.

930
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,067
Tell me what flavors
your cookies are.

931
00:36:25,067 --> 00:36:27,067
They are
lime-flavored cookies.

932
00:36:27,067 --> 00:36:30,200
And then I just have a big layer
of vanilla buttercream.

933
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,400
Mm. I taste lime.

934
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:37,067
Aidan, you got to
bake these longer.

935
00:36:37,067 --> 00:36:39,533
This isn't chewy.
This is underbaked.

936
00:36:39,533 --> 00:36:41,300
I can still taste the flour.
-Aw, disappointing.

937
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:43,867
-Yeah.
-Don't be shy, man.

938
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,167
Color is flavor.

939
00:36:45,167 --> 00:36:46,300
But your stories --
out of this world.

940
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,767
-Thanks, Aidan.
-Thanks. Bye.

941
00:36:47,767 --> 00:36:49,933
-Good job.
-Bye.

942
00:36:49,933 --> 00:36:52,067
I just expected more.

943
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,800
ANNOUNCER: The winner of
the "Kids Baking Championship"

944
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,567
will receive a sweet
prize package

945
00:37:02,567 --> 00:37:05,467
that includes a future story
in "Food Network Magazine"...

946
00:37:05,467 --> 00:37:06,700
Hallelujah!

947
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,667
-And...
-$25,000.

948
00:37:09,667 --> 00:37:13,833
[ All cheering ]

949
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,667
Winner is coming.

950
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,400
Mobile App
Cookie Challenge.

951
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,933
So this is, uh,
a decorating challenge...

952
00:37:22,933 --> 00:37:24,600
-Mm-hmm.
-...a taste challenge...

953
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,800
and a storytelling
challenge.

954
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,333
Yeah, I think some of our app
developers did pretty good.

955
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:30,700
You know, like Justice.

956
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,167
He did great.

957
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:33,933
Now, for me today,

958
00:37:33,933 --> 00:37:37,167
Cole made some
beautiful cookies.

959
00:37:37,167 --> 00:37:39,567
Cole's got to figure out
how to make his flavors

960
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:40,567
match his decorating.

961
00:37:40,567 --> 00:37:43,200
Conversely, Justice
needs to bring

962
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:45,500
his decorating up
to match his flavors.

963
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,300
And we know he can.
We've seen him decorate.

964
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,133
Let's talk about
a few mobile app cookies

965
00:37:50,133 --> 00:37:54,233
that, um, I would
probably delete.

966
00:37:54,233 --> 00:37:55,800
What was going on
with Aidan today?

967
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,333
I've had better days.

968
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,133
I mean, that fondant was,
like, half-an-inch thick.

969
00:38:00,133 --> 00:38:02,500
And the cookie
was way underbaked.

970
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,967
But the thing that really
disappointed me today --

971
00:38:04,967 --> 00:38:06,567
Audra's decorating.

972
00:38:06,567 --> 00:38:10,067
No.
I'm not gonna finish.

973
00:38:10,067 --> 00:38:11,533
Really sloppy design.

974
00:38:11,533 --> 00:38:13,467
By the time she had
to get them decorated,

975
00:38:13,467 --> 00:38:15,900
it was just
a rush of mess.

976
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,067
Yeah.

977
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:18,967
What happened
to Jason today?

978
00:38:18,967 --> 00:38:20,567
Dude,
I do not know, man.

979
00:38:20,567 --> 00:38:22,700
I don't even know what that is.

980
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,200
It's just sloppy.

981
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,400
You know, the thing that
really disappointed me today

982
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,067
the most was his stories.

983
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,067
He had no stories.

984
00:38:30,067 --> 00:38:31,167
I haven't really
come up with it.

985
00:38:31,167 --> 00:38:33,433
It's still in the beta version.

986
00:38:33,433 --> 00:38:36,567
Of all these guys,
Jason loves to talk.

987
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:38,233
-Yeah.
-You finally give him a chance,

988
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:40,500

the subtle orange

this straight to the finale.

had bugs that needed fixing

with pineapple ice cream.

105
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:18,667
The first thing I need to do
is to get my butter

and brown sugar melted.

Now I'll get started
on my cake batter.

First, I sift together
all my dry ingredients.

113
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,967
And I add butter,
milk, and oil and eggs.

114

Once that is smooth,
I use the pineapple juice...

Ah, crushed pineapple.

116
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,233
...and a little bit
of the pineapple chunks

117

to give it
a more pineapple flavor.

118
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,900
I pour on my
butter-and-brown-sugar mixture,

The pans that I'm using are
removable like cheesecake pans.

126
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:10,067
Because of that,
it has cracks at the bottom.

on a sheet tray

140
00:05:37,567 --> 00:05:38,900
To start my pie dough,

141
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:42,433
I pulse sugar, flour, and salt,
butter, and my shortening

142

until it forms a nice,
crumbly mixture.

I add a little bit of vinegar

your pie crust even flakier.

00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:58,233
I make a big ball,
a little ball, and six legs,

274
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:00,300
and stick it
all together by using water.

275
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,400
I still have
to finish these doughnuts.

276
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,167

in the blast chiller,

I'm gonna start
on making my filling.

281
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,400
I peel the skin off the peaches
'cause it's not the best to eat.

282
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,133
You want the peaches to shine

283

part of this dish.

to be that sweet.

285
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:25,800
So I add some lemon juice
and nutmeg

286
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,600

of spice in there as well.

If not, we're gonna get
raw fruit and raw dough.

290
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,300
Oh, I don't like raw dough
in my pie. No.

291
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,667
I roll my dough out.

292
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,167
And I plop that
into the pie tin.

293
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,433
And I strain out the peaches.

294
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:44,900
I don't want too much liquid
in there

295
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:48,300
or else it'll turn
into peach soup.

296
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,533
Next, I cut some nice
straight lattices

297
00:11:51,533 --> 00:11:54,400
and weave it on top
of the pie.

298
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,167
It'll make your pie
look super good.

a messy process,

Ah, it came out perfectly.

448
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,600
And it looks perfect.

449
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,267
I go to check
on my chocolate shells.

450
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,067
Is this cool?
Yeah. That's cool.

451
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,133
Ah.

452
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,200
Oh, my goodness.

453
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,167
They're just falling apart.

454
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,167
Oh, gosh.
I messed that up.

455
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:01,067
Ah.
This is the sole foundation

456
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,567
of what I'm making today.

457
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,633
Ew.

to the judges.

461
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,200

Slice your pound cake.

Cut out mini cake rounds.

474

Put cake in the parchment.

Scoop ice cream

[ Sighs ]

486
00:19:12,667 --> 00:19:13,833
No.

487
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:16,067
Aidan is pulling out
his chocolate turtle shells.

488
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,567
And they are breaking.

489
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,633
Chocolate is one of the most
difficult things to work with.

490
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,467
Oh, poor Aidan.

491
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:23,533
I don't think I let
this cool long enough.

492
00:19:23,533 --> 00:19:26,267
I definitely should've
blast chilled my chocolate.

493
00:19:26,267 --> 00:19:28,400
I'm really worried
about this.

494
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,067
I'm just gonna have
to do that again.

495
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,067
I didn't let it cool
long enough.

496
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,300
I just need to restart them.

497
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,700
So I have to melt
some more candy melts.

498
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,400
All right.
This one better turn out right.

499
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,767
I'm gonna take extra care
when making these.

500
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,367
And this time,

501
00:19:45,367 --> 00:19:47,300
I'm going to put them
straight in the blast chiller

502
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,967
so they're just nice and hard.

503
00:19:48,967 --> 00:19:50,200
And they won't crumble

504
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,133
as I take them
out of the molds.

505
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,133
If these chocolate shells
don't come out,

506
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:57,633
I'm in serious trouble.

507
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,233
JUSTICE:
I run to check on my pies.

508
00:19:59,233 --> 00:20:01,567
And they're not done yet.

509
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,700
This is bad.

510
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,467
I can't serve this
to Duff and Valerie.

511
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:08,700
So I just have to wait to the
last minute to take them out.

512
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,967
It's a little bit scary.

513
00:20:09,967 --> 00:20:13,000
But I need to now decorate
my little peach balls

514
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,267
and make them
look like guinea pigs.

515
00:20:15,267 --> 00:20:17,833
I found these little
googly eyes.

516
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:21,267
So I'm just gonna use those
and stick them on with butter.

517
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:24,867
KANIYAH:
It's time for me to turn

518
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:29,933
my pineapple upside-down cake
upside down.

519
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,733
I flip them onto the plate.

520
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
Beautiful!
They're all beautiful.

521
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,333
Whoa.

522
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:43,833
I might just eat one.

523
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,600
Now I just need
to get my cookies done.

524
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,667
Are these done?

525
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,033
Please tell me
that they're done.

526
00:20:48,033 --> 00:20:49,267
Take them out the oven.

527
00:20:49,267 --> 00:20:50,900
And they're just the way
I like them.

528
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:54,267
I go grab some candy eyeballs

529
00:20:54,267 --> 00:20:57,433
and little chocolate chips
to put for the mouth.

530
00:20:57,433 --> 00:21:00,500
These cookies are way better
than last week's.

531
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,300
AIDAN: I'm going to put cake
and buttercream

532
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,367
inside my chocolate shell.

533
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:07,833
Buttercream.

534
00:21:07,833 --> 00:21:11,500
I'm making my tried-and-true
Swiss meringue buttercream.

535
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I heat up my egg whites
and sugar.

536
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,767
And I whip that into a meringue.

537
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:17,567
Mm, yummy.

538
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,533
Then you add
a whole pound of butter.

539
00:21:20,533 --> 00:21:23,600
Whole pound,
that's what makes it yummy.

540
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,067
I'm adding green
to decorate the turtles.

541
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,200
I don't have time
to color this any deeper.

542
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,733
And for this twist,

543
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:32,233
I want to make a fish out
of orange-colored buttercream

544
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,667
to go with my turtle.

545
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,933
It's gonna be tight.

546
00:21:34,933 --> 00:21:36,900
5 minutes, bakers.

547
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,567
COLE: My doughnuts are cooled.

548
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:40,133
And I dunk them
in the maple glaze

549
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:43,633
and sprinkle some good
bacon on there.

550
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,733
These doughnuts look really,
really good.

551
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:50,167
But I don't have time
to eat any.

552
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:51,667
I'm grabbing my pies
out of the oven.

553
00:21:51,667 --> 00:21:54,067
Please let them be done.

554
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,267
Yes! They have
a nice, crispy top shell

555
00:21:56,267 --> 00:21:57,600
that does not seem gushy.

556
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,967
I just had enough time.

557
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:02,500
But now it's a mad rush
to get everything on the plate.

558
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,133
So, on my cake, I'm going
to include this egg

559
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:09,933
next to these little love birds

560
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:13,100
because, well,
she laid an egg.

561
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,367
I'm just running out of time.

562
00:22:15,367 --> 00:22:17,833
So I choose fondant
for my mini pet egg

563
00:22:17,833 --> 00:22:23,100
because I really can't think
of anything else.

564
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,067
And I'll just see
how it works out.

565
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,100
AIDAN: I take my shells out
of the blast chiller.

566
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,567
If these don't turn out,
that's it.

567
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,067
I loosen out the sides.

568
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:42,100
I pull it out very delicately.

569
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,333
Yes!

570
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,067
Your chocolate looks
really good.

571
00:22:45,067 --> 00:22:46,500
I know.
I'm so glad it came out.

572
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,333
I was really worried
about time.

573
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:51,167
I need to hurry and get
these turtles assembled.

I will make it
to the semifinals.

576
00:22:55,967 --> 00:22:59,767
I fill up my chocolate shell
with cake and buttercream

577
00:22:59,767 --> 00:23:01,767
and then pipe out little arms

578
00:23:01,767 --> 00:23:04,467
and his head and his tail.

579
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:07,133
To make my fish,
I pipe a little head,

580
00:23:07,133 --> 00:23:11,367
tail and put on
some googly eyes.

581
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:13,433

00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,067
I don't know
if I can finish.

583
00:23:15,067 --> 00:23:18,100
You can, Aidan.
You can do it.

584
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,400
My fish look
a little weird.

585
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,567
Some of them
are kind of guh.

and what you made for us.

I got a guinea pig.
And I made for you a peach pie

604

with a guinea pig
with a tiny little peach inside,

00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:18,133
kind of like a doughnut hole

a fried-peach-goodness ball.

00:24:27,333 --> 00:24:31,300
How do you relate a peach pie
to a guinea pig?

611
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,333
So, once upon a time,

612
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:38,233
a mean hawk came and took
the guinea pig into the air.

But then it dropped it.
And it fell into a tree.

And it told all the other
little guinea pigs.

615
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:44,900
And they all climbed up
in the tree

616

and ate all the peaches.

00:38:34,333 --> 00:38:36,567
What in the world
was going on with Aidan today?

977
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:39,667
I was kind of surprised
by what he put on the plate.

978
00:38:39,667 --> 00:38:41,767
I think he was creative.
And he thought about it.

979
00:38:41,767 --> 00:38:43,067
And he made a turtle.

980
00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:46,100
It was just so sloppy.

981
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:49,133
It tasted great, though,
really delicious cake.

982
00:38:49,133 --> 00:38:51,633
The buttercream was perfect,
nice, crispy shell.

983
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:53,267
Valerie,
it did taste great.

984
00:38:53,267 --> 00:38:54,900
But at the same time,
it was boring.

985
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,633
It was just vanilla cake,

986
00:38:56,633 --> 00:38:58,600
vanilla frosting,
a chocolate shell.

987
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,100
And look.
For his pet's pet,

988
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,700
he had a glob of buttercream,

989
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,200
put some eyes on it,
and called it a fish.

990
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,400
Okay.
But the buttercream is edible.

991
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,600
Cole's spider
was not edible.

992
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,733
Do you really want to just
eat a blob of buttercream?

993
00:39:10,733 --> 00:39:13,167
-Over fondant? Yes.
-Fair enough.

994
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,967
I feel like
I'm nitpicking.

995
00:39:14,967 --> 00:39:17,167
But we're gonna decide
who's gonna be in the final four

996
00:39:17,167 --> 00:39:18,667
for this competition.
-Mm.

997
00:39:18,667 --> 00:39:20,567
So we have to just
pick apart each dessert

998
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,133
more than
we ever would before.

999
00:39:22,133 --> 00:39:24,267
-Yep.
-This is huge.

1000
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:26,233
You ready to make
that decision, Valerie?

1001
00:39:26,233 --> 00:39:28,800
I'm pretty sure I know
who's going home today.

1002
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:31,167
I do, too.

1003
00:39:31,167 --> 00:39:32,600
I really hope I make it.

1004
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,300
Bakers, we're not sure
which was more memorable,

1005
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:39,100
your faces when you walked in
and saw the animals

1006
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:44,067
or tasting your incredibly
creative Pet Project Desserts.

1007
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:46,100
Two bakers in particular
gave us desserts

1008
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:49,533
that made us want
to beg for more.

1009
00:39:49,533 --> 00:39:51,233
[ Laughs ] Duff.

1010
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,900
Justice,
your peach pie

1011
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:57,100
with the latticework crust
was ridiculously delicious.

1012
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:00,200
Thank you.

1013
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,800
-Kaniyah.
-Oh, yeah.

1014
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,467
You made a gorgeous
pineapple upside-down cake

1015
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:08,633
and creamy,
delicious ice cream.

1016
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:09,767
Oh, yeah.

1017
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:12,200
We looked it up,
and your story of bunnies

1018
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:15,400
eating pineapples was legit
and charming.

1019
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,133
Mm-hmm.

1020
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:18,467
You have both
earned a spot

1021
00:40:18,467 --> 00:40:20,833
in next week's semifinals.

1022
00:40:20,833 --> 00:40:23,200
Yeah!

1023
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:26,800
But one baker's creations
were the best in show.

1024
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:30,067
And that baker is...

1025
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:31,267
Kaniyah.

1026
00:40:31,267 --> 00:40:32,267
Yes!

1027
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:33,967
Again, again, again.

1028
00:40:33,967 --> 00:40:35,333
I did it.
I did it.

1029
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,233
I'm in the final four,
ooh, ooh.

1030
00:40:38,233 --> 00:40:40,800
Congratulations,
Kaniyah.

1031
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,800
Now,
there was one other baker

1032
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,433
whose dessert was good enough

1033
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,600
to earn a spot
in the final four.

1034
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,767
Please be me.
Please be me.

1035
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:53,967
Cole, we will see you
in the semifinals.

1036
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,533
Thank you.
Phew.

1037
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:59,667
That means Aidan and Audra,
you're in the bottom.

1038
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:00,700
Please step forward.

1039
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,433
Aidan, your chocolate turtle
with yellow cake

1040
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:09,067
and vanilla buttercream
made us crave

1041
00:41:09,067 --> 00:41:10,767
more exciting flavors.

1042
00:41:10,767 --> 00:41:14,200
And your mini pet fish really
was just a blob with eyes.

1043
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:19,700
Audra, your banana cake

1044
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,400
with vanilla frosting
had way too much banana.

1045
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,367
Your chickens didn't really
look like chickens.

1046
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,600
And the mini pet egg you made
was way too big.

1047
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:31,667
The baker who will be
leaving us today is...

1048
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,700
Audra.

1049
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:37,433
Sorry, Audra.
-We are so gonna miss you.

1050
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:39,133
You have been such a pleasure
to have around.

1051
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:42,067
You are an awesome,
awesome baker.

1052
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:43,700
AUDRA:
Even though I didn't win,

1053
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,533
I've shown the whole world
that I can bake well.

1054
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:50,467
-I'm gonna miss you so much.
-I'm gonna miss you more.

1055
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:53,167
Everyone here is just so nice.
And I'm really gonna miss them.

1056
00:41:53,167 --> 00:41:54,633
Bye.
-See you, girl.

1057
00:41:54,633 --> 00:41:57,833
But as soon as I get home,
I'm going to hug my cat.

1058
00:41:57,833 --> 00:42:00,067

-Chicken!
-Oh, bunnies!

One of these critters is going
to inspire what you bake.

00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,433
When are you gonna
get the waffle tattoo?

MICHAEL: I'm gonna book you
an appointment right now.

00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:18,067
This is the best pineapple
upside-down cake I've ever had.

really in a hurry.

-I was.
-I can tell.

You have to
really step it up.

I don't know what's going on.

But Duff and Valerie
are wearing lab coats.

And I just know we're doing
something science-y.

00:00:57,067 --> 00:00:58,467
And I don't like that.

favorite subject.

into the inner sanctum

of science and baking --

ingredients using science.

For example,

00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:47,067
you can use
spherification chemicals

into little pearls of flavor.

and the sweetness
of lime simple syrup.

And it is delicious.

This is, like,
freaky, honestly.

58
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,733
And to top it all off,

59
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,500
a smoking gun
adds smoke flavor to anything.

00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:59,067
-Oh, yeah. You can.
-Thank you.

96
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:01,133
Apparently,
it's legal for a child

97
00:04:01,133 --> 00:04:03,133
to use a smoker gun.

98
00:04:03,133 --> 00:04:05,200
So...

99
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,067
-Hi, Aidan.
-Hi.

100
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,233
Whatcha making, buddy?

101
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,833
I'm making
a s'mores-inspired tart

102
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,167
with a graham-cracker
crust.

103
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,433
And I'm gonna have
smoked chocolate ganache.

104
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:19,067
So you're gonna use
the smoking gun.

105
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,267
And which other method
are you gonna use?

106
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:23,967
I'm gonna make peanut butter
powder using the tapioca.

107
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:26,267
Yum.
That sounds delicious.

108
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:29,200
What would you do
if you won $25,000?

109
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:33,700
I might just set $1,000
aside to have to spend.

110
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,367
I have two dogs at home.

111
00:04:35,367 --> 00:04:38,700
And I hope sometime
to buy a cat maybe.

112
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,100
My dad is allergic.

113
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,533
So I don't know
if it'll work out or not.

114
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:44,800
But in the future,
I want a cat.

115
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,967
I love cats so much.

116
00:04:47,967 --> 00:04:49,700
I might call it Cookie.

117
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,867
I don't want to hold you up.

118
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:52,767
This looks like
a really exciting dessert.

119
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,100
-Bye.
-Buh-bye.

120
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,200
I put my chocolate in the bowl,

121
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,900
cover it with Saran Wrap.

122
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:01,267
I put wood chips in the smoker,
turn the fan on.

123
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,600
And then I light
the wood chips on fire.

124
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,967
And all of a sudden, the smoke
starts to fill up the bowl.

125
00:05:06,967 --> 00:05:08,933
Wow.

126
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,333
After there is smoke in it,

127
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,600
you just seal off
the plastic wrap

128
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,267
and let the smoke
sort of flavor the chocolate.

129
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:18,267
The smoking gun,
when I first smelled it,

130
00:05:18,267 --> 00:05:20,067
it really made me
think of camping.

131
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:21,600
It smelled just like a campfire.

132
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,167
And that's why I wanted
to make a s'more tart.

133
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,567
But I don't want to
oversmoke my chocolate.

134
00:05:26,567 --> 00:05:28,800
Okay.
There's a lot of smoke.

135
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
If the smoke alarm goes off,

136
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,167
I don't want to get eliminated.

137
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,867
It tastes like it's burnt.

138
00:05:37,867 --> 00:05:39,933
Smoky all right.

139
00:05:39,933 --> 00:05:43,067
Hmm.

140
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,767
I heat up my cream
in the microwave,

141
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,367
pour it over the chocolate

142
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:48,933
and let that sit
for the chocolate to melt.

143
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,600
Smoky. It's good.

144
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,067
I would have loved
a mad science room.

145
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,200
I had a chemistry set.

146
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,600
-Did you?
-Uh-huh.

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,067
Almost burned
the house down.

148
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:02,533
Not surprised.

149
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:10,067
Today, I'm making a cinnamon-
and nutmeg-infused apple pie

150
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:12,833
with a ice cream-
and raspberry-caviar.

151
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,233
I love apple pie.

152
00:06:14,233 --> 00:06:16,167
I make apple pie all the time.

153
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,367
It's a favorite of my family.

154
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:21,700
First things first,
my apples are chopped.

155
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,433
So I'm gonna put them
in a plastic bag

156
00:06:23,433 --> 00:06:26,333
with simple syrup,
cinnamon sticks, and nutmeg

157
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:28,467
so I can get them
in the immersion circulator.

158
00:06:28,467 --> 00:06:30,933
It takes almost half an hour

159
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,700
to fully suck in the flavors.

160
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,400
These flavors are gonna
infuse in the apples.

161
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,567
And it's gonna taste
just like apple pie.

162
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:42,100
Last week was really difficult.

163
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,267
So this week, I'm going
to manage my time

164
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,567
and make everything perfect.

165
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:51,967
My biggest competition
is probably Aidan.

166
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:54,633
He's very creative,
just like me.

167
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:58,333
So I need to step up
my game a little bit.

168
00:06:58,867 --> 00:07:01,833
15 minutes gone, bakers.

169
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:04,633
15 minutes, bakers.

170
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,700
How's everyone doing?
Why so serious?

171
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,900
The competition is getting
super intense.

172
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,200
And I want to win so bad.

173
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,400
So my dessert
has to be really good.

174
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,100
Where are the apple corers?
-Oh, what are you doing?

175
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,867
Are you doing, like,
an apple crumble?

176
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:22,067
Cobbler.

177
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,433
I wish I could make a pie.

178
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:25,433
But I did make one last week.

179
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:28,167
So instead, I think
I will make a cobbler.

180
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,667
Normally I make them
out of, like, berries.

181
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:32,067
But today I think
I'm gonna do apple

182
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:33,867
and a smoked-apple ice cream.

183
00:07:33,867 --> 00:07:35,133
Are you done
with the corer?

184
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:36,600
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

185
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,633
I'm borrowing
the corer from Cole.

186
00:07:38,633 --> 00:07:41,933
And I'm realizing he's also
making an apple pie.

187
00:07:41,933 --> 00:07:44,233
Hooray.

188
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,333
Why?

189
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,267
Do you have the ground nutmeg?
-Yeah.

190
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,967
I borrow
the nutmeg from Cole.

191
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:52,067
And I realize he's only
using nutmeg and cinnamon.

192
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:56,400
So I'm using cinnamon,
nutmeg, and mace.

193
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,067
Mace is like a spice you can use
to help make it taste

194
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,767
even more like apple pie

195
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,400
and warm coziness.

196
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,067
I cut a lemon and I squeeze
some juice into a teaspoon

197
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,933
'cause it's nice
to have some tartness.

198
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,233
I'll put the apple spices

199
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:10,100
and all my other spices

200
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,167
into the immersion circulator

201
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:14,533
so it can become all nice
and blended together.

202
00:08:16,767 --> 00:08:18,100
What's up, Justice?

203
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,900
So you're using
the immersion circulator

204
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,100
and what else?
-The smoker.

205
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,800
Chemistry,
you got it.

206
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,267
Yeah.
How badly do you
want to be in this finale?

207
00:08:26,267 --> 00:08:29,333
Well, on a scale of one to 10,
I would want it infinity.

208
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:30,733
I think if I got
into the finale,

209
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:33,200
I would be able to just
win the whole thing

210
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,667
and be, like...
-Smooth sailing.

211
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:36,067
"I did it. Yay."

212
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:37,600
-Good luck.
-Thank you.

213
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,933
Go get them.

214
00:08:38,933 --> 00:08:40,767
How are you boys doing?

215
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:42,833
-Good.
-Mm-hmm.

216
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:44,300
I may be the only girl left,

217
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,900
but those boys
better watch out.

218
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,667
I'm bringing it, no doubt.

219
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:51,500
I'm gonna make
a smoked-berry pie

220
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,300
with hazelnut-chocolate snow

221
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,633
with a raspberry-caviar
ice cream.

222
00:08:58,767 --> 00:09:01,067
I want to get started
on my pie crust

223
00:09:01,067 --> 00:09:04,767
because it's going to take
a long time to get it perfect.

224
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,300
So I add flour,
a little bit of sugar,

225
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,333
salt, butter,
vegetable shortening.

226
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,300
And then I add
my ice-cold water.

227
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,767
You always want to use
cold butter

228
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:19,833
and cold water to make it flaky.

229
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,600
I'm the only girl.

230
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,233
But that's okay 'cause
I'm gonna win some money.

231
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,133
When I win the $25,000,

232
00:09:28,133 --> 00:09:29,967
I'm going to expand my business

233
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:31,900
and get more customers

234
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:34,100
and buy a lifetime supply

235
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,067
of expensive, good sneakers

236
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,667
'cause I love sneakers.

237
00:09:37,667 --> 00:09:40,667
Moola, cha-ching.

238
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,967
Hey, bakers.
Can we have your attention?

239
00:09:42,967 --> 00:09:45,133
-Yep.
-What is that?

240
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:48,100
We are about to take
molecular gastronomy

241
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,467
back in time.

242
00:09:49,467 --> 00:09:51,200
I don't mean
to scare you guys.

243
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,800
But this could be
really "whisk-y."

244
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,633
-What?
-Y'all are evil.

245
00:09:56,633 --> 00:09:57,733
[ Both laugh ]

246
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:07,167
We are about to take molecular
gastronomy back in time.

247
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,767
What is that?

248
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,267
In addition to your
two modern tools,

249
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,933
you must use
an old-school whisk.

250
00:10:13,933 --> 00:10:16,900
For what?
Make some whipped cream
for your dessert.

251
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,567
-By hand?
-Y'all are evil.

252
00:10:18,567 --> 00:10:19,700
That's right.

253
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,767
You got to use
old-fashioned elbow grease.

254
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,333
-That's mean.
-Come on.

255
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,767
Come up
and get your whisk.

256
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,267
-Come up and get your -- whoa.
-Sorry.

257
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:29,733
-That's okay.
-We're so sorry.

258
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,167
That's fine.

259
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:32,633
-Ooh, I like this one.
-I got the good one.

260
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:33,833
AIDAN: This is mean.

261
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,767
There's a weird,
tennis-racket-shaped whisk.

262
00:10:36,767 --> 00:10:37,933
I grab it.

263
00:10:37,933 --> 00:10:40,100
It's whipped cream
unplugged.

264
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,233
My whisk looks like something
you mash potatoes with.

265
00:10:45,233 --> 00:10:47,267
It doesn't even look
like a real whisk.

266
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:50,700
Heavy cream. I'm gonna make
a plain whipped cream

267
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,833
and just, like,
keep it as simple as I can.

268
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:55,800
I put the cream into the bowl.

269
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,067
And I start to whisk.

270
00:10:57,067 --> 00:10:59,733
And then I add some sugar.

271
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:02,167
If you overwhisk it,
it'll turn into butter.

272
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:05,600
And you do not want that.

273
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,300
Where's my whisk?

274
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,333
Not all whisks
are created equal.

275
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,067
When you're hand-whipping
whipped cream,

276
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,267
you really want
a half-moon whisk

277
00:11:13,267 --> 00:11:14,633
'cause you can just
really shake it.

278
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:17,067
And it just whips
in front of your eyes.

279
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,733
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

280
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:20,733

I'm gonna get my pie done first.

285
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,600
I should have plenty of time
to make my whipped cream.

286
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,867
AIDAN: Ooh, gosh.

287
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:38,600
I wanted to be so clean today.

288
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,300
But no.

289
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,133
"Aidan, you can't
be clean today

290
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:45,433
'cause you have
to whip cream by hand."

291
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,200
Ooh, Aidan is not happy
about that twist.

292
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,833
This is stupid.

293
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,067
Oh, Aidan.
I'm sorry.

294
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,433
I'm sorry for the twist.

295
00:11:52,433 --> 00:11:55,567
A little bit of powdered sugar
for sweetness.

296
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:58,067
And now I'm gonna chill this
until it's ready.

Twist down.

298
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,667
It would take me
the entire 90 minutes

to whip up whipped cream
with my hand.

300
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:09,100
You know, you and I
are gonna whip cream by hand.

301

Ugh, I don't want to.

302

about three minutes.

Uh, not -- No.

304

To make my graham-cracker crust,

308
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,067
I get graham-cracker crumbs,

309
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,533
butter, and a little
bit of sugar.

310
00:12:26,533 --> 00:12:28,767
And I just mix those
with my hands.

some softened butter,

313
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,967
I just don't want it to stick.

314
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:38,933
I don't want there to be
any chance of a crumbly tart.

315
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:41,300
Why is everyone doing pies?

316
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,067
My dessert is gonna stand out

317
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:44,300
because I'm the only one

318

or a cobbler

319

are basically the same thing.

Good. All right.
I'm gonna bake these.

322
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,467
And I bake them off
for five minutes.

323
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,967
And it'll be nice and hard.

45 minutes left, bakers.

328
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,267
My pie crust has to be
in the oven

329
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,967
for at least 20 minutes.

330
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,067
And I need to hurry up.

Okay.

332
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:13,067
I combine butter and flour first

333
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:17,833
and then add water gradually
until it forms a dough.

334

Ooh.
And ice cream

338

So you're using
the spherification chemicals?

00:13:29,167 --> 00:13:30,767
-Yes.
-And the immersion circulator?

340
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,767
Yes.
This is gonna
get you into the finale?

341
00:13:33,767 --> 00:13:36,067

-Yeah. It's gonna get me to win.

342
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:39,300
Good attitude.

343
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,700
I'm in this competition to prove

344
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,167
that I can do this
and that boys can bake.

345
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:45,100
And I'm starting to work
on my cobbler dough.

346
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,100
For this, I use
self-rising flour

347
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,067
because it already has
a leavening agent in it.

348
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,400
So it'll just puff up
automatically.

349
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
And you don't have to put
baking powder in there.

350
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,100
The first thing I do is
I measure my butter and flour.

351
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,333
And I just smoosh it together.

352
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:01,067
I just want to get it
all crumbled up.

353
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:04,200
Then I start to add
my buttermilk,

354
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,100
nutmeg, cinnamon, and salt.

355
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,767
I add some mace and my sugar.

356
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:12,400
Mm. It's super good.

357
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,767
Next, I need to start
and assemble everything.

358
00:14:14,767 --> 00:14:18,267
And I add all the nice
filling that I had.

359
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:20,167
Then I crumble my dough on top.

360
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:22,333
You want just, like,
clumps of it all over.

361
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,933
And I'm ready to put them
in the oven.

362

It's gonna taste
super good, I hope.

363
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,167
Right now, I think the top
two are Cole and Aidan

364
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,633
because they're
really good bakers.

365
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:34,733
And they can also do
really good decorations.

366
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:37,633
But I'm not really intimidated
because I think that my cobbler

367
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:41,433
will probably be able
to keep me in the competition.

Then I let it sit

00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:23,500
I keep plastic wrap on top

These berries have
got to be smoked by now.

drops in there,

ANNOUNCER: How to make quick and
easy hot chocolate mug cakes.

447

microwave-safe mugs,
cinnamon sticks,

449
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:04,233
and a little whipped cream.

450

Parcel out your batter,

451
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:10,600
about 1:30
in the microwave to bake.

Top with a whole cinnamon stick

Give us
a molecular-gastronomy dessert.

Use that mad science to make
those flavors come alive.

Alive!Alive!

461
00:18:37,067 --> 00:18:38,667
This is not working for me.

462
00:18:38,667 --> 00:18:41,200
So I'm not really sure
what I'm gonna do.

463
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,667
I'm so stressed right now.

464
00:18:42,667 --> 00:18:46,867
This raspberry caviar
looks terrible.

465
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,167
Cole, figure it out.

466
00:18:48,167 --> 00:18:50,433
I can't do this.
I'm doing something else.

467
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:52,133
I think
he's scrapping it.

468
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:54,400
Oh,
I wanted to taste it.

469
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,133
I don't know
what I did wrong.

470
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,100
But I need to start
something else.

471
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,933
I can't go home.

472
00:19:00,933 --> 00:19:03,233
Kaniyah, do you have
any peanut butter?
No.

473
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:05,067
Aidan, do you have
peanut butter?

474
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,567
Yeah.
I have peanut butter.

475
00:19:06,567 --> 00:19:08,400
I decided to make
peanut butter snow.

476
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,767
Why did I not think
of this first?

477
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:13,733
I spent so much time
thinking about raspberry caviar.

478
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:15,100
It didn't even work.

479
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,133
And raspberry does not
go with apples.

480
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,767
Can I use some?

481
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:21,100
-Yeah. I'm all done with it.
-I grab the peanut butter.

482
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,067
And there's not
a lot in the jar.

483
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:24,500
There's just enough

484
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,533
that I could still make
some peanut butter snow.

485
00:19:26,533 --> 00:19:28,400
17 minutes.

486
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,333
Got to make the snow.

487
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:34,467
I mix peanut butter
and tapioca maltodextrin

488
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,600
and put it in a food processor.

489
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,500
And it'll turn from white
to, like, a light tan.

490
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,600
And it's kind of weird,
so weird.

491
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:48,533
AIDAN:
I notice that Cole is making
peanut butter snow just like me.

492
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:50,333
Hmm.

493
00:19:52,433 --> 00:19:54,600
Crap.

494
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,700
Okay.

495
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,067
We're gonna find out
who is better

496
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,633
and who goes home.

497
00:19:59,633 --> 00:20:02,733
Okay. Don't get nervous, Aidan.
You have tons of time.

498
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,100
It's time to assemble
my s'mores.

499
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,267
I start to delicately
take out my shells.

500
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:10,600
And they're crumbling.

501
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,133
No, no, no, no, no.

502
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,633
[ Gasps ] Aidan's tart shells
are breaking.

503
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:15,733
What's he gonna do?

504
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:17,433
I'll tell you what
he's not gonna do --

505
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,100
make a tart.

506
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,233
I don't know why
they're crumbling.

507
00:20:20,233 --> 00:20:22,033
Maybe they're not
hard enough.

508
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,433
That's kind of falling apart.

509
00:20:23,433 --> 00:20:25,000
Next time, he's gonna
put some more butter

510
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,200
and sugar in there.

511
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,767
I can't use this.

512
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:32,500
I am freaking out because
it's the main point of my dish.

513
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,467
I should've never
ever done this.

514
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:37,800
10 minutes, bakers.
You got 10 minutes.

515
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:41,000
I just need to turn them into
deconstructed tarts.

516
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,233
I'm gonna have
to plate the crumbs

517
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:43,700
inside a little glass

518
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,667
because when all else fails,
deconstruct.

519
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:47,767
Okay.

520
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:50,633
And I put ganache on

521
00:20:50,633 --> 00:20:53,700
and put a nice dollop
of whipped cream on top.

522
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:56,133
And I think that's good.

523
00:20:56,133 --> 00:20:58,733
-Ah!

00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,267
-You startled me.
-I'm alive!

526
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:05,267
I seriously thought
you just --

527
00:21:05,267 --> 00:21:06,800
You got me for a second.

528
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,833
I'm scared.

529
00:21:08,833 --> 00:21:11,900
JUSTICE: Now that my cobblers
are in the oven,

530
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,600
I am gonna start working
on my smoked-apple ice cream.

531
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,833
I light the wood chips.

532
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,667
And it's starting to glow.
And that's what you want.

533
00:21:19,667 --> 00:21:20,833
It looks super cool.

534
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,333
The apples are basically
marinating in the smoke.

535
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:25,533
So I'm ready to start
my crème anglaise.

536
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:28,467
And I put some milk,
cream, and vanilla bean

537
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:31,767
in a saucepan
until it's nice and warm.

538
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,233
And then I add my sugar,

539
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:36,300
egg yolks, and some spices
until it's pale in color

540
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,067
and put that
in the ice cream machine.

541
00:21:38,067 --> 00:21:40,767
So I get my apples
out of the bowl.

542
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,133
And I start to incorporate those

543
00:21:42,133 --> 00:21:44,633
so that it gets that nice,
smoky flavor.

544
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:47,067
-Can I use this, please?
-Yeah. I'm all done.

545

made your powder?

-No.
-Hurry, hurry, hurry.

Got a lot to do
during this bake.

It's time to start
on my ice cream.

549
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,433
I use milk, heavy cream,

550
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:58,533
raspberry puree,
and raspberries.

551
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,067
And I bring it to a low boil.

552
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:04,700
And then I get my ice cream
into the ice cream maker...

553
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,433
Put it in the blast chiller
to make it harder.

554
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:11,567
I get the pies out of the oven

555
00:22:11,567 --> 00:22:13,433
and place them
on a cooling rack.

556
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,200
And then I get
started on my snow.

557
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,700
How you doing,
Kaniyah?

558
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,900
Good.

I just need hazelnut spread.

Anybody have
the hazelnut spread?

561
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:24,733
I never touched it.

562
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:27,500
I go run over
and get a food processor.

563
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,767
My chocolate-hazelnut snow
is gonna be on point.

564
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:33,233
And, like, what's not to love
about chocolate and berries?

wasn't whipped.

Hey, Cole.

792
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,233
COLE:
This challenge was so stressful.

793
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:50,267
I don't like science.

794
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:51,833
Okay. So, tell us
what you made for us.

795
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,267
I made a apple pie

796
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:56,867
with a classic
vanilla ice cream

797
00:30:56,867 --> 00:31:00,733
and a peanut butter snow.

798
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,433
Cole, I got to tell you, man,
this is a beautiful plate.

799
00:31:03,433 --> 00:31:06,633
I like how your pie is
very kind of laissez-faire.

800
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:09,267
It has a very kind of, like,
just whimsical feel to it.

801
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,333
Yeah. Let's taste it.

802
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:11,667
All right.
Here's a good bite.

803
00:31:11,667 --> 00:31:13,433
I got ice cream
and whipped cream...

804
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:15,600
-Mm-hmm.
-...an apple and the snow.

805
00:31:19,267 --> 00:31:21,800
The apples are really infused
with a lot of flavor.

806
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,300
I taste the cinnamon.
I taste the nutmeg.

807
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,867
I taste the simple syrup.

808
00:31:24,867 --> 00:31:27,767
I am missing a little bit more
of an apple pie filling.

809
00:31:27,767 --> 00:31:30,133
It seems all dry.
-You got to have some goo.

810
00:31:30,133 --> 00:31:31,700
Pie needs goo, right?

811
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,200
There's got to be goo, right?
You sous vide the apples.

812
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,600
You cooked them
in a simple syrup.

813
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,167
You take
that simple syrup out,

814
00:31:37,167 --> 00:31:39,133
make a slurry
with some cornstarch.

815
00:31:39,133 --> 00:31:41,233
Thicken it up,
add it to your apples.

816
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,600
You would've had
a pie filling.

817
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
But your ice cream
on the other hand, whoa.

818
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,867
That is a perfect
vanilla ice cream.

819
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:51,533
And it's so good with
the peanut butter snow on it.

820
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:54,333
I love the two flavors together.
-Thank you.

821
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:57,700
Cole, I shouldn't
be able to do this.

822
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,733
That's dough.

823
00:31:58,733 --> 00:32:00,067
Wait, what?

824
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,100
I'm sorry, man.

825
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,300
This is raw pie dough.

-I know. Shoot.
-Raw pie dough.

right now?

828

This guy should've been
in the oven right away.

829
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,433
You could've
baked this thing

830
00:32:11,433 --> 00:32:13,433
till it was nice
and golden-brown.

831

You could've baked
a separate lattice by itself

833
00:32:16,633 --> 00:32:19,233
then taken those apples,
put them in here.

834
00:32:19,233 --> 00:32:21,700
Okay.
But, man,
this ice cream is fantastic.

835
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:24,267
I'll dip the crust
in the vanilla ice cream

to get me to the finale.

-Good, really good.

I think we'll be
the judge of that.

-What did you make today?
-Apple cobbler.

848
00:32:44,267 --> 00:32:46,067
So I used
an immersion circulator.

849
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:47,867
And so all those flavors
would be, like,

850
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,233
in there
and taste super good.

851
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,067
And a whipped cream.

852
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:52,833
And then the smoker
seems really fun.

853
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:56,067
So I used the smoker
for the leftover apples I had

854
00:32:56,067 --> 00:32:58,733
in a smoked-apple
ice cream.

855
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,867
That's the best whipped cream
I've seen today.

Well, he's a beast. Look at him.
Let me see that thing.

Mmm. It's got
a lot of nice flavor.

Tell me the spices
you used in your cobbler.

863
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,800
Cinnamon, nutmeg,
and ground mace.

864

-Ground mace?
-Yeah.

Well, it's seasoned
very well.

866
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:24,533
I could eat just
these apples alone

867
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,100
without anything else
on them.

868
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,733
I knew they would
like my apples.

869
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:29,733
I was eating them
during the whole bake.

870
00:33:29,733 --> 00:33:32,233
I knew they were amazing.

871
00:33:32,233 --> 00:33:35,700
Now, you make
a biscuit-style cobbler.

872
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:38,433
It's more of, like,
a scone batter, I think,

873
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,800
'cause
it has sugar in it.

874
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,067
And normally biscuits
don't have sugar in them.

875
00:33:43,067 --> 00:33:44,433
When I do a cobbler,

876
00:33:44,433 --> 00:33:47,100
I almost do like
a cake batter on top.
Ooh.

877
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,600
So you have
two schools of thought here.

878
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,700
Sure.
I mean, some people
do biscuits on top.

It's gone
a little brown.

883

So I don't know
that I would've put it on top.

884
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:02,433
Used the smoker
on the ice cream?

885

I don't taste
a lot of smoke.

886

there at the end.

to soupy water.

I think I was kind of
angry at the ganache.

Well, you know, this is a really
important decision, you know,

968

into the finale.

that apple cobbler.

There was so much flavor
in the apples.

973
00:37:16,733 --> 00:37:18,400
Mmm.
It's super good.

974
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,100
However, I don't know
that I tasted

975
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,500
a lot of smoke
in the ice cream.

976
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,367
You don't want it to taste
like charred wood.

977
00:37:23,367 --> 00:37:25,100
You almost couldn't
taste it though,

978
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,733
unlike Aidan's dessert,

979
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:28,800
where you tasted the chocolate.
It was delicious.

980
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,367
And then at the very end,
you got that smoke.

981
00:37:30,367 --> 00:37:32,533
It's smoky.
It's good.

982
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:34,633
It's really smart because
you make s'mores at a campfire.

-Right.
-I tell you what, though.

-Oh, poor Kaniyah.
-You know, listen.

986
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:42,700
For me, Kaniyah's pie
just wasn't successful.

987
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:45,133
The challenge was she had to get
whipped cream on the plate.

988
00:37:45,133 --> 00:37:46,700
And she did.

989
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:50,400
But we both know that Aidan came
over and had to help her out.

990
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,500
Well, he whipped the cream.
But she flavored it.

All right, Val.

This is not a decision
we can make lightly.

1009
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,333
Someone should have
a talk with these kids

1010

a little easier on us.

there wasn't a lot of smoke

in the smoked-apple
ice cream.

1035
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,433
But the immersion circulator
helped to infuse

a nice level of spice
right into your apples.

That spice and your perfect

You have overcome nine weeks
of intense challenges

56
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:25,867
and revealed a level
of energy

57
00:02:25,867 --> 00:02:28,633
and determination
that is almost superhuman.

58
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:31,233
And I should know,
because my alter ego

00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,067
is Dessert Man!

60
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,400
So what's your superpowers?

00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,300
Did you not see me
just bust through that wall?

62
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,833
Oh, yeah.
He busts through walls

63
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,167
and eats cookies all day!

superhero cake.

What?
What?

71
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,700
AIDAN: I'm less into superheroes
and more into baking,

72
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,567
so I'm really nervous
about this challenge

73
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,833
because I have no clue
what I'm going to do.

74
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,200
And your baking time starts...

75

Aaaah!

I have no clue what
my superhero's going to be,

77
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:22,600
but I do know I want to make
a lemon rosemary olive oil cake.

78
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,300
We have to create
a unique superhero

79
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,067
on our cake in some way.

00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,200
I'm going to make
a mascarpone frosting.

81
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,067
Sound yummy?

82
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,733
I want to do lemon,
rosemary, olive oil

83
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:38,233
because I want something bold
and different for the finale.

84
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:41,067
I mix flour, sugar, eggs,

85
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:44,567
salt, buttermilk,
baking powder,

86
00:03:44,567 --> 00:03:46,167
replace the butter
with olive oil,

87
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:47,933
and then a little bit
of rosemary.

88
00:03:47,933 --> 00:03:49,300
Ah, rosemary.

89
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,800
I'm just going to cut up
a little bit.

90
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,300
Don't want to overpower it.

91
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,067
I just take a couple
teaspoons of rosemary,

92
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:56,733
because a little bit
goes a long way.

93
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,267
Delicious lemon zest.

94
00:03:58,267 --> 00:03:59,867
I'm adding a bunch
of lemon zest,

95
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:02,067
and, to have a really
strong lemon flavor,

96
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:03,433
I'm going to add
some lemon juice,

97
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:06,267
'cause Valerie loves lemons.

98
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,767
My inspiration
behind this cake

99
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:09,267
is how Valerie loves lemons.

100
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:11,933
If I can execute
this cake perfectly,

101
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:14,567
it will stand out
and I'll win.

102
00:04:14,567 --> 00:04:16,333
Mm, mm, mm.

103
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:19,867
Aidan's making
lemon rosemary olive oil cake.

104
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,367
That makes me very happy.

105
00:04:21,367 --> 00:04:23,333
You know, olive oil cakes
have such a nice texture.

106
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:26,133
And they're so moist
if you make them right.

107
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,967
If you make them right.

108
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:31,500
AIDAN: Into the oven.

109
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,133
Okay.

110
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:35,233
All the big bakes
have been important,

111
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:38,067
but right now, this is
the only one that matters.

112
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:43,700
I'm making a lemon blueberry
infused with rosemary cake

113
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,533
with a lemon icing.

114
00:04:46,533 --> 00:04:49,067
I'm doing lemon.

115
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:52,700
What?

116
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,067
I'm actually doing lemon,
olive oil, rosemary.

117
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:59,067
Ah.
Aidan, sorry.

118
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:02,533
My cake is going to
wow the judges.

119
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:05,700
I put rosemary,
lemon, and blueberries

120
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,800
in a bag together

121
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,767
and I put it in
the immersion circulator.

122
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:12,167
That thing is really cool.

123
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:16,067
It infuses blueberries
with a flavor in no time.

124
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:17,600
VALERIE: Look what
Kaniyah's doing!

125
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,267
So she had so much
fun last week

126
00:05:20,267 --> 00:05:22,367
with the immersion
circulator

127
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:24,167
that she is using it
again this week.

128
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:25,533
I'm really excited that --

129
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,467
that they're thinking
about flavor.

130
00:05:28,467 --> 00:05:31,967
My superhero is
Catastrophe Girl.

131
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:33,533
It goes through town,

132
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,733
trying to save the catastrophe
from happening.

133
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,967
Hopefully there will
be no catastrophes

134
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:44,933
for my Catastrophe Girl cake.

135
00:05:44,933 --> 00:05:47,167
Ah!

136
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,667
I get my batter in a pan

137
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,067
and I plop
my blueberries on top.

138
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:55,267
There's no system to putting
these blueberries in my cake.

139
00:05:55,267 --> 00:05:57,733
Put 'em in
and you push them down!

140
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,567
How's it going, Kaniyah?
Need to put your timer on?

141
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,600
Mm...

142
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,233
I freehand mine.

143
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:09,633
Really?
Well, so who's
your superhero?

144
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,933
Catastrophe Girl.
Catastrophe Girl?

145
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:14,533
Yep. She comes around
and fixes catastrophes.

146
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:15,733
Oh, okay.

147
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:17,733
Has she been in your station?
It looks like it.

148
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:20,067
Yes.

149
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,100
Good luck.

150
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay.
Yep.

151
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,433
What does
Catastrophe Girl do?

152
00:06:25,433 --> 00:06:29,300
She helps the world
with catastrophes.

153
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,400
So, like, if there was,
like, a fire,

154
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,800
she would go help the people
where the fire was?

155
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,233
Yes.
Oh, cool.

156
00:06:36,233 --> 00:06:38,700
My superhero is Weather Man.

157
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Weather Man.

158
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,733
My inspiration
behind this cake

159
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,533
is my passion for weather.

160
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:46,933
I literally, every single day
that I have free time,

161
00:06:46,933 --> 00:06:48,533
just read about weather,

162
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:51,967
look up stuff about weather,
look outside at the weather.

163
00:06:51,967 --> 00:06:53,500
I really love weather.

164
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,933
Justice, what kind of cake
are you making?

165
00:06:55,933 --> 00:06:58,233
Rose cake. I'm just
going to see how that goes.

166
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:02,267
Ooh, rose, yeah,
that's a sophisticated flavor.

167
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:07,367
I will be making
a three-tiered rose cake.

168
00:07:07,367 --> 00:07:09,733
I quadrupled the cake recipe.

169
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:12,367
I feel like this cake
is going to be huge!

170
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,067
And that's exactly what I want.

171
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:16,467
I'm using rose flavoring

172
00:07:16,467 --> 00:07:18,933
because I think it's a nice,
elegant flavor,

173
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:22,600
and rose also represents hope,
love, and balance.

174
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,333
That's the doing
of the Weather Man.

175
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,700
It's so important to taste
while you're baking,

176
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,667
because if you say,
"It's a rose cake,"

177
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:35,867
and they're like,
"I don't taste any rose"...

178
00:07:35,867 --> 00:07:39,367
You have to make sure it tastes
like what you're saying.

179
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,400
Hello, Justice.
Hello.

180
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,600
So I'm wondering, how badly
do you really want to win this?

181
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:48,600
I really infinity
really want to win this.

182
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Why?
I want to be
the first boy to win.

184

that your farm
will be expanding?

00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:59,300
Maybe. I don't know.
You haven't talked to 'em yet?

187
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,767
Not really.
Okay.

188
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,433
Well, we'll -- we'll start
with the first thing,

189
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:03,900
and first
you've got to win it.

190
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,400
Yep.
So I'll leave you alone.

191
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,467
Okay.

192
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,067
So are you really going to
get a goat if you win?

193
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,567
Yeah.

194
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,100
What would you
get if you won?

195
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,833
I don't know.
Hey.

196
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,833
If you don't know, maybe you can
just buy me a goat if you win.

197
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:24,067
What would you do with $25,000
at 12 years old?

198
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,533
Okay, besides put it away

199
00:08:25,533 --> 00:08:27,600
and save for college or,
you know...

that's what I did.

getting my cakes in the oven,

on my frosting.

215
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,867
I'm thinking of mascarpone

216

because I've seen mascarpone
and lemon used a lot,

217

to be really fancy.

230
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:33,633
whip that up,
and slowly sweeten it

231
00:09:33,633 --> 00:09:34,867
with powdered sugar.

232
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,733
You know, I don't know
if this is going to work.

233
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:38,533
I'm mixing
my mascarpone buttercream,

234
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:41,867
and it's yellow
and thick and gross.

235
00:09:41,867 --> 00:09:43,433
What the heck am I doing?

236
00:09:43,433 --> 00:09:44,800
I need to start
a new batch of frosting.

237
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,133
This isn't working.

238
00:09:46,133 --> 00:09:48,533
I'm just going to scrap
this completely

239
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:52,467
and stick with my tried
and true buttercream recipe.

240
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,500
Shoot,
I need a double... ooh!

241
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,533
I almost walked
in on your station!

242
00:09:57,533 --> 00:09:59,300
What am I doing?

243
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,100
What on Earth
am I doing right now?

244
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,967
I can do this.

245
00:10:03,967 --> 00:10:05,900
Your cakes are
going to be great.

246
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,767
My Swiss buttercream,
I've made it a lot in the KBC.

247
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:14,433
Let's -- let me think about it.
I'll be -- I'll be right back.

248
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,933
Okay. I've made it one,

249
00:10:16,933 --> 00:10:19,500
two...
Ooh, yummy.

250
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,300
I've made it three times --
four times already.

251
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,267
All the time,
it's come out perfect,

252
00:10:25,267 --> 00:10:27,967
so I'm just going to
do that again.

253
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,633
To make my frosting,
going to heat up egg whites

254
00:10:30,633 --> 00:10:33,200
and sugar,
whip those into a meringue,

255
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,167
add my butter, and boom,

256
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,333
you have a nice,
delicious buttercream.

257
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,433
I'm kind of sad that
the mascarpone didn't work out,

258
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:44,133
but I'm dressed and I did not
want to spend more time

259
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:45,767
on something that
might not come out.

260
00:10:45,767 --> 00:10:47,500
Nothing else could go wrong.

261
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,700
There's no room
for mistakes now.

262
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,267
What's that smell?

263
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,867
There's a weird smell,

264
00:10:55,867 --> 00:11:01,067
and it is freaking me out.

265
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,967
What did you smell,
Aidan?

266
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,367
It smells like
scrambled eggs.

267
00:11:04,367 --> 00:11:05,667
DUFF: Scrambled eggs?

268
00:11:05,667 --> 00:11:07,733
Somebody scramble
their cake?

269
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:10,533
Hope it's not my cakes.

270
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:13,333
Oh, it -- it smells like
scrambled eggs in here.

271
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:16,333
If you smell scrambled eggs,
you probably have

272
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:19,200
some serious issues
with your cake.

273
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,100
I may have to
restart my cakes.

274
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,900
I am so scared right now.

275
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,800
I'm second-guessing myself.

276
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,567
I don't know what to do.

277
00:11:35,633 --> 00:11:38,900
Something smells
like scrambled eggs.

278
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,867
I may have to restart my cakes.

279
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,333
DUFF: * Duh-duh-duh-duh! *

280
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,633
Three hours
and 30 minutes left!

281
00:11:45,633 --> 00:11:47,400
Looks pretty good!

282
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,467
Original superhero cakes!
Good.

283
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:53,400
I'm worried that I put
too much rosemary in.

284
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,633
VALERIE: Well,
get 'em done!

285
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,600
What's going on
with Aidan?

286
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,633
Why does it smell
bad in here?

287
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:04,833
Hey, buddy.
What's going on?

288
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:07,800
I'm a little worried there's
too much rosemary in my cake.

289
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,833
It smells like
scrambled eggs in here.

290
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:13,733
VALERIE: The aroma of rosemary
is much stronger

291
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:15,400
than the actual
taste of it.

292
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:17,667
Okay.
Don't want you to
second-guess yourself too much.

293
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:20,167
Trust yourself.
You've got good instincts.

294
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:21,633
Valerie says that
my cakes are good,

295
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:23,767
but I still smell
scrambled eggs,

296
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:25,467
so I'm kind of freaking out.

297
00:12:25,467 --> 00:12:27,700
If I make a mistake,
there's no doubt about it,

298
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,067
I'm not going to win,

299
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:32,933
so everything
has to be flawless.

300
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:37,300
No! They're burnt.

301
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:40,133
I am flipping
the freak out,

302
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:43,567
ultimate terror moment.

303
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,867
I ruined 'em.

304
00:12:44,867 --> 00:12:47,067
I don't feel so good.

305
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,500
It's one thing to burn
a cake at home,

306
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,267
but it's another huge thing

307
00:12:51,267 --> 00:12:54,167
to burn a cake
in the finale of the KBC.

308
00:12:54,167 --> 00:12:56,600
My cakes are really brown.

309
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,067
I'm just going to
shave it off.

310
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,433
I have to fix these burnt cakes,

311
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:02,433
so I'm going to shave off
the burnt part

312
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,367
and put simple syrup
in the middle.

313
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,467
Okay. I can do this.

314
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:09,833
Simple syrup is just water
and sugar, boiled and cooled,

315
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:16,067
and it helps keep any cake,
even burnt cakes, moist.

316
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:19,067
I'm assembling my cake tiers

317
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:22,700
by putting cake,
simple syrup, frosting.

318
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:26,267
I might be making myself be
a little bit more nervous

319
00:13:26,267 --> 00:13:29,067
than I need to be,
but this is the finale

320
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,700
and everything matters here.

321
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,133
VALERIE: Three hours left,
bakers!

322
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:37,967
Show us you are
a baking superhero!

323
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,500
My rose cakes are done,

324
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:43,833
so I cut off the top
to get it as flat as possible.

325
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:45,267
Yum.

326
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:47,367
It tastes exactly the way
it's supposed to be.

327
00:13:47,367 --> 00:13:48,700
I really taste the rose.

328
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,667
It's really good.
It's really moist.

329
00:13:53,167 --> 00:13:58,100
DUFF:
What's Kaniyah doing with all
those toothpicks in her cake?

330
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,167
Oh, wow.

331
00:14:00,167 --> 00:14:02,167
Kaniyah's using toothpicks

332
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,967
as a guide
so she can carve it.

333
00:14:04,967 --> 00:14:06,600
That's very smart.
Yeah.

334
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,633
She's making it look
like an octagon or something.

335
00:14:08,633 --> 00:14:11,700
Good girl!

336
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,533
[ Gasps ] Yay!

337
00:14:13,533 --> 00:14:15,500
This lemon blueberry
rosemary cake

338
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,867
is going to be
Catastrophe Girl's

339
00:14:17,867 --> 00:14:18,967
cool superhero shield.

340
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:21,400
I did it.

341
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,300
So good.

342
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,600
I want my cake
to be tall,

343
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:29,367
so this cake is
going to be four layers,

344
00:14:29,367 --> 00:14:31,100
and it looks really cool.

345
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,400
It looks just like a shield.

346
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,300
Kaniyah!
Hello.

347
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:40,300
Have you ever made
a $25,000 cake before?

348
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,100
No! I have made a $26 cake.

349
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,667
[ Laughs ]

350
00:14:44,667 --> 00:14:47,567
Just a couple more zeros
behind that, that's all.

351
00:14:47,567 --> 00:14:48,967
Have fun.
Okay!

352
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:52,533
I just need to figure out
the design for my superhero.

353
00:14:52,533 --> 00:14:56,633
I want Catastrophe Girl
to have a cape,

354
00:14:56,633 --> 00:14:59,600
her hands on her hips,
and a ponytail.

355
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,967
I'm piping the design

356
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:04,233
and it's not coming out
exactly how I wanted.

357
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:08,233
This is so hard,
trying to draw a superhero.

358
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:10,533
I have my design
and I need to put it

359
00:15:10,533 --> 00:15:13,400
in the blast chiller
before I put it on the cake.

360
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,133
VALERIE:
Two and a half hours, bakers!

361
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:18,900
Superhero cake.

362
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,400
JUSTICE:
For my frosting, I'm using
a normal vanilla buttercream,

363
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,367
because even if it would work
well with other flavors,

364
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:29,167
I feel like just solid rose
will taste really good.

365
00:15:29,167 --> 00:15:30,833
I get all my crumb coats done

366
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,633
and I need to start
working on my fondant.

367
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:37,533
Ooh, it's hard.
I've worked with
fondant before.

368
00:15:37,533 --> 00:15:39,767
It's kind of hard to
work with because it can rip,

369
00:15:39,767 --> 00:15:41,200
and you do not
want it to rip.

370
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:44,300
It'll be hard
to put it on the cake.

371
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,833
Oh!
My fondant rips.

372
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:48,333
That's super annoying.

373
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:49,833
It's a little frustrating.

374
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:52,367
I'm trying to patch
together my fondant,

375
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:54,533
but it's looking
horrible and messy

376
00:15:54,533 --> 00:15:57,333
and I'm really sad,
but then I think,

377
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,467
"Yes! I can make clouds
and cover this up!"

378
00:16:00,467 --> 00:16:03,433
So I get white fondant
and cut it into cloud shapes

379
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:06,467
and I put that over my cake.

380
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:09,367
If you could have any
superpower, what would it be?

381
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:10,900
Hmm.

382
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,367
I think invisibility
would be good.

383
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:13,800
If you could be invisible,
you could, like,

384
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,867
hide in the bank,
wait till they close,

385
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:17,767
get the money,
wait till they open, walk out.

386
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:21,800
You're doing terrible things
with your invisibility!

387
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
Okay, now let's just --
I'm just going to lay it out.

388
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
If I had superpowers,
I would be a villain.

389
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,067
Just...
You'd be a...

390
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,400
I'd be a villain.
You are --

391
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,167
you would be the cutest
villain in the world!

392
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:34,433
90 minutes left, bakers!

393
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:37,300
Who will be
the Kids Baking Champion?

394
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:40,167
What type of superheroes
are you guys doing?

395
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,700
A weather one.

396
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,067
Catastrophe Girl.

397
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,800
What are you making,
Aidan?

398
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,600
I don't know yet.

399
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Oh.

400
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,900
Aidan doesn't know
what his superhero is yet?

401
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:53,333
What? That's crazy.

and I stir that until
it's all nice and good,

do that so greatly?

521
00:22:39,367 --> 00:22:42,500
This might be one of the best
fondant jobs I've ever done.

522
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,733
Well, I have a lot of
different colors.

00:22:45,733 --> 00:22:48,500
I grab a big case of rock candy
in every different color

stick it into the fondant on top

I'm going to get some isomalt
on the mold to make my prism.

534
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,433
Isomalt is a special type
of sugar that

when you melt it down,
it resists humidity.

536

I get my isomalt
melted on the stove

00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,400
and I pour it in and I'm just
going to let it cool down.

Wow!
After a while,

to choose from.

543

I think it'll be
perfect for a prism

544
00:23:33,533 --> 00:23:35,333
because it looks
just like glass.

There's the prism.

559
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,200

560
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,633
make it look like
it's flying in the wind,

561
00:24:15,633 --> 00:24:18,333
and I make his eyes,
his mouth, and his hair.

562
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:22,267
It looks like he's
a superhero weather man.

563
00:24:24,133 --> 00:24:28,333
And I'm going to make a letter W
for "weather" on top of my cake

564
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:31,267
so it's like
* Mr. Weather Man *

I look at my W.

569
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,433
I put it on backwards.

570
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:43,500
It's an M.

571
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:46,067
So I pick it up
and I turn it over,

572
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:49,067
but now I have
all this red, watery,

573

30 seconds!

This is not beautiful.

If I was a artist,
this cake would've been amazing,

582

00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,767
I'm thinking
outside the box,

584
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:16,467
so I'm going to put candy on
this to add some decoration.

Hey, Justice.

This is the last time
I'll ever walk into

610
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,333
this kitchen for judging,
and it's going to be

611
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,600
the last time Duff and Valerie

612
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,633
will ever taste
something I've made.

to see how it goes.

like my cake.

All right, so, Justice,

617
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,233
introduce your superhero
and your villain.

618
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,900
Mr. Weather Man.

619
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:00,367
He is the ruler of all
the weather on planet Earth.

620
00:27:00,367 --> 00:27:02,200
He can make it
a beautiful day

621
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,933
or he can make it stormy
for a month straight.

622
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:11,267
But his evil enemy
is Mr. Sunshine.

623
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:13,433
A lot of people
want Mr. Sunshine,

624
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:16,300
but after a while,
you would want Mr. Weather Man,

625
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,267
because Mr. Sunshine
will make scorching heat

626
00:27:19,267 --> 00:27:23,067
and sunburn all year round.

627
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:24,500
I like it.
Yeah, me too.

I like it.
Tell us all about your cake.

629
00:27:26,333 --> 00:27:32,433
I made a rose extract cake
with a buttercream frosting,

630
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:36,600

rice treats covered in fondant.

I love your cake.
I love that you can

totally see that
he's in the sky.

633
00:27:40,167 --> 00:27:42,800
I like the way his cape
is off to the side

634
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,067
so it looks like he's got some
wind flowing under his cape.

635
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,333
I think your cake
looks really good.

You know,
it's three tiers.

You know, looks like your cake
is pretty straight,

There's a couple of dings.

You know, you can see, like,
the fondant tore a little bit.

642
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,300
You know, you got all these
nice clouds on top.

643
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,133
I think you could've gone clouds
the whole way down

644
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,967
and covered up
a lot of those things.

645
00:28:04,967 --> 00:28:08,067
Yeah.
Let's taste that.

646
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:10,700
Now, why'd you go with,
uh, rose extract?

647
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:14,900
I thought it was a really
nice and elegant flavor.

648
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,533
Definitely taste the rose.

649
00:28:16,533 --> 00:28:19,167
You can smell it first.
Super moist.

650
00:28:19,167 --> 00:28:20,900
And it's not too much.

651
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,567
No, it really is
quite elegant.

652
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:24,100
But I can tell you,
I think you could've

653
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,633
taken a chance and put some
other flavors in there

654
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,167
that would've gone
with the rose.

655
00:28:28,167 --> 00:28:29,400
You know, pistachios.

656
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,100
Honey goes really well
with the rose.

657
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,367
There's a lot that
you could do with that.

658
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:33,467
Yeah.

659
00:28:33,467 --> 00:28:36,333
I thought that
if I added other flavors,

660
00:28:36,333 --> 00:28:39,433
it might overpower the rose,
and come on, guys,

661
00:28:39,433 --> 00:28:41,933
you've got to stop
and smell the roses!

662

My superhero is Prism.

He is a being of pure light

and shines it through color
and emotion and life,

691

and Dismal over here,
he does the exact opposite.

692

where dismal death is,

would've been so cool if...

746
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:41,500
It would've just pumped it up
that much more.

747
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,467
Right. Yeah. Yeah. In --
And I love your villain, man.

748
00:32:44,467 --> 00:32:45,700
I love Dismal.

749
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,367
He's got a lot of personality,
you know what I mean?

750
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:50,100
And he really
kind of feels Dismal.

751
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,433
Um, I would say you probably
could've gotten away

752
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:55,300
with about half
that much buttercream.

753
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,667
Okay.
Thank you, Aidan.

754
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,933
Bye. Thank you.

755
00:32:58,933 --> 00:33:02,767
I hope that Prism can
really shine a light through

756
00:33:02,767 --> 00:33:04,233
and help me win.

757
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,933
I guess it's in fate's hands.

758
00:33:06,933 --> 00:33:09,300
God, I do wish that there
was that mascarpone on there.

759
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,767
I know!
It's just buttercream.

760
00:33:10,767 --> 00:33:13,500
It just needed a frosting
to make it stand out.

761
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,333
Yeah.

762
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:21,100
You know why this is
my favorite challenge of all?

763
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,067
Why is that?
Because it's cake!

764
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:25,067
And I am
the Cake Crusader.

765
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:27,567
I'm just incognito
right now.

766
00:33:27,567 --> 00:33:29,500
You like
jump into the pantry.

767
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,067
[ Whirring ]

768
00:33:31,067 --> 00:33:33,200
Come back out.

769
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,067
You want to call in Kaniyah?
I think we should.

770
00:33:35,067 --> 00:33:36,733
Hey, Kaniyah!

771
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:41,700
This should
be interesting.

772
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,733
I am so close to $25,000.

773
00:33:44,733 --> 00:33:48,267
My cake is not
how I wanted it to look,

774
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:51,267
but I hope it tastes amazing.

775
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:52,800
Hello.
Hey.

776
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,633
Kaniyah, so, the last 10 weeks,
did you have fun?

777
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,867
Yes, I had some up and downs.
You won a few weeks.

778
00:33:58,867 --> 00:34:00,400
You came close to losing
a few weeks.

779
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,867
You have had
some ups and downs.

780
00:34:01,867 --> 00:34:03,333
But it was fun.

781
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:05,500
Tell us
about everything.

782
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:10,067
My cake is a lemon blueberry
infused rosemary cake,

783
00:34:10,067 --> 00:34:11,467
and the buttercream
is a lemon and then

784
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,367
just the regular buttercream.

785
00:34:13,367 --> 00:34:15,967
My superhero
is Catastrophe Girl,

786
00:34:15,967 --> 00:34:20,433
flying across there
to go catch the bad potato.

787
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:21,800
Oh, I see.

788
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:25,200
My imagination was reeling
about mashed potatoes,

789
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,267
and I was like, "Hmm,
how 'bout an evil potato?"

790
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:29,833
He used to be
a good ol' potato,

791
00:34:29,833 --> 00:34:31,667
till somebody left him
in the refrigerator.

792
00:34:31,667 --> 00:34:33,067
He turned bad.

793
00:34:33,067 --> 00:34:35,100
Um, that's what
happens when you

794
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,667
leave a potato
in the 'fridge.

795
00:34:36,667 --> 00:34:40,467
He turned brown and black
and destroyed the world.

796
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:41,767
You know, you know what
I love about your cake?

797
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:44,600
It is colorful.
I think it's really fun,

798
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:48,233
but I think that you
probably had a plan

799
00:34:48,233 --> 00:34:50,500
and I think that the plan
didn't work out.

800
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:53,867
No.
And I think you just
went to town.

801
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:56,800
And that's okay.
You know what I like about it?

802
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,400
I like the fact that it's shaped
like a superhero shield.

803
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,467
It's good thinking.
Let's taste it, Kaniyah.

804
00:35:02,467 --> 00:35:03,700
I'm excited.

805
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,133
Thank you, Kaniyah.

806
00:35:05,133 --> 00:35:08,167
Look at that beautiful
blueberry in there.

807
00:35:08,167 --> 00:35:11,967
That's pretty.
It looks like a muffin.

808
00:35:11,967 --> 00:35:14,400
It does taste like
a blueberry muffin, doesn't it?

809
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,867
Yeah.
It's very dense cake.

810
00:35:17,867 --> 00:35:19,167
Ugh.

811
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:21,233
A tiny bit
on the dry side.

812
00:35:21,233 --> 00:35:22,867
I love blueberries
and lemon together.

813
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,433
It's one of my favorites.

814
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:27,167
I think you just left it in
the mixer a tiny bit too long,

815
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:28,800
so it's a little chewy,

816
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,167
but the taste is great.

817
00:35:31,167 --> 00:35:32,400
It's a delicious cake.

818
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,067
And what's your superhero --

819
00:35:34,067 --> 00:35:36,233
villain, Bad Potato,
made out of?

820
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:37,967
Cream-filled cookies.

821
00:35:37,967 --> 00:35:39,133
How did you
get 'em together?

822
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:41,200
Butter.
Buttercream. Okay.

823
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,667
Um, not buttercream,
just plain old butter.

824
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,433
Just plain butter?

825
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:47,767
Let's taste that villain.

826
00:35:47,767 --> 00:35:50,300
All right.

827
00:35:52,933 --> 00:35:54,467
That's a buttery cookie!

828
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:57,100
It actually tastes
really good with the butter.

829
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,667
It would've been probably
oversweet with the buttercream.

830
00:35:59,667 --> 00:36:01,667
Mm.
Smart move.

831
00:36:01,667 --> 00:36:03,300
I want some more
of that.

832
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,867
Super creative.
Thank you.
Good job, Kaniyah.

833
00:36:05,867 --> 00:36:07,800
Thank you.
Thanks, Kaniyah.

834
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,367
Mm.

835
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:12,500
Judging's over and I'm not
that confident right now,

836
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,600
but I still think I have
a chance to win.

837
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,133
Maybe.

838
00:36:18,133 --> 00:36:20,300
Cookies and butter?
Why not?

839
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,467
Now, I know.
I mean, come on.

840
00:36:22,467 --> 00:36:23,700
A new treat.

841
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:26,733
Uh-oh.

842
00:36:26,733 --> 00:36:28,633
All right. Valerie,
we are going to need

843
00:36:28,633 --> 00:36:31,667
all our superpowers
to decide this one.

844
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,967
Justice.
Wow.

845
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,133
You know, I love the Weather Man
character that he created.

846
00:36:35,133 --> 00:36:37,533
His cape was being
blown by the wind.

847
00:36:37,533 --> 00:36:38,700
It really works.

848
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,133
It's really clever.
Fun story. Yeah.

849
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,067
It is.
His tiers were round.

850
00:36:42,067 --> 00:36:44,400
They were centered.
They were flat.

851
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,600
To execute a cake that clean
is really impressive.

852
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,367
Very impressive.
I loved Justice's cake.

853
00:36:50,367 --> 00:36:54,433
It was so elegant
and so subtle but yet moist.

854
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,367
It was a delicious cake,
but I've got to tell you,

855
00:36:56,367 --> 00:36:59,067
I really think it could've
used a little something.

856
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,633
I really taste the rose.

857
00:37:00,633 --> 00:37:02,467
Even just some honey
in the buttercream.

858
00:37:02,467 --> 00:37:05,333
Mm, mm.
Or just, you know,
a little bit of lemon,

859
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,800
a little bit of orange would've
gone well with that rose.

860
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,167
Let's talk about Kaniyah.

861
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,067
I really like the flavor
of her cake

862
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:12,500
and the flavor
of her buttercream.

863
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:15,700
I just think the cake itself
is a little tough.

864
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,167
KANIYAH: Oh!

865
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:20,600
We had Catastrophe Girl
and Rotten Potato.

866
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,300
I think her story
was a little weak.

867
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:26,067
Yeah. But really,
that cake is colorful

868
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:28,933
and feisty and fun,

869
00:37:28,933 --> 00:37:30,400
just like Kaniyah is.

870
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,400
All right,
let's talk about Aidan.

871
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,433
You know, I don't know
if this is going to work.

872
00:37:34,433 --> 00:37:36,300
Had he not told me
that he was going to

873
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:39,333
make mascarpone frosting,
I wouldn't have missed it,

874
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:42,433
but it's just killing me
that he didn't do it!

875
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:44,133
We've had
a lot of buttercream.

876
00:37:44,133 --> 00:37:46,533
Making a buttercream isn't
really making it unique.

877
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:48,700
No.
And I think he had

878
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,533
way too much buttercream
in his cookies.

879
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,167
Yes.
It just kind of
overpowered the cookies.

880
00:37:52,167 --> 00:37:53,733
You really couldn't
taste 'em.

881
00:37:53,733 --> 00:37:57,267
But I love that there was
a prism on top of his cake,

882
00:37:57,267 --> 00:38:00,467
sending out color.
It was beautiful!

883
00:38:00,467 --> 00:38:04,467
And Aidan's lemon rosemary
olive oil cake.

884
00:38:04,467 --> 00:38:05,567
It was delightful.

885
00:38:05,567 --> 00:38:07,767
Pretty sophisticated
for a 12-year-old.

886
00:38:07,767 --> 00:38:09,067
Yeah.

887
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:11,567
But also sophisticated,
a rose cake

888
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:15,733
that I ate the entire slice
and then ate yours, too.

889
00:38:15,733 --> 00:38:19,367
Oh, it's so close.

890
00:38:19,367 --> 00:38:21,533
This is the closest
it's ever, ever been.

891
00:38:21,533 --> 00:38:22,533
This is -- yeah.

892
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,700
It's never
not a tight race.

893
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,067
This is the tightest
it's ever been.

894
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,400
Bakers, you have competed

895
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,700
against the largest
number of bakers

896
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,067
in this baking
championship's history,

897
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:56,167
and it's all come down
to three of you.

898
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:59,367
Of course, the only question
remaining is,

899
00:38:59,367 --> 00:39:01,433
which one of you deserves

900
00:39:01,433 --> 00:39:04,733
to become
Kids Baking Champion?

901
00:39:06,267 --> 00:39:08,600
We asked you to create
a one-of-a-kind,

902
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,400
original superhero cake,
and you all showed

903
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,567
tremendous skill
and creativity

904
00:39:15,567 --> 00:39:18,867
in carrying out
this super task.

905
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,433
Kaniyah.
Hmm?

906
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:24,567
Your lemon blueberry
superhero cake was bright,

907
00:39:24,567 --> 00:39:28,400
fun, and festive,
just like you.

908
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,067
Your Rotten Potato villain,

909
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:33,733
made from crushed-up
cookies with butter,

910
00:39:33,733 --> 00:39:37,433
was very creative
and darn tasty.

911
00:39:37,433 --> 00:39:40,067
And your story of
Catastrophe Girl

912
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:43,200
versus Potato Man
was pure Kaniyah --

913
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,633
unexpected
and entertaining.

914
00:39:46,633 --> 00:39:51,600
Aidan, your lemon
olive oil rosemary cake,

915
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,900
it took us
to another dimension.

916
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:56,067
We loved it.

917
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:59,400
The sponge was moist,
the rosemary was subtle,

918
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,733
and your decorating
was really artful.

919
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:07,333
And your story of Prism versus
the evil Dismal was powerful

920
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,767
and it touched us both.

921
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:13,033
Justice, your Weather Man
superhero cake

922
00:40:13,033 --> 00:40:17,600
proved you have baking powers
well beyond your years.

923
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,000
Your rose-flavored cake
was sophisticated,

924
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,433
moist, and delicious.

925
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:25,167
You balanced
the rose perfectly.

926
00:40:25,167 --> 00:40:27,533
Your villain, Mr. Sun,
was yummy.

927
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,000
Mm-hmm.
And your story of Weather Man

928
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,400
versus Mr. Sun
was inventive

929
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,300
and it definitely played
to one of your passions.

930
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,033
You all made
a heroic effort today,

931
00:40:40,033 --> 00:40:42,500
but only one of you
can win the title

932
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:47,567
of Kids Baking Champion
and $25,000.

933
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:53,767
I feel like I'm about
to fall on the floor.

934
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:57,700
I so badly do not want to
go home empty-handed.

935
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:02,667
The winner of
"Kids Baking Championship" is...

936
00:41:08,567 --> 00:41:10,267
Aidan!

937
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:11,533
JUSTICE: Good job, Aidan!

938
00:41:11,533 --> 00:41:12,800
[ Laughter ]

939
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,067
I won? I won?

940
00:41:15,067 --> 00:41:16,233
Good job!

941
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:17,767
Congratulations, Aidan!

942
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,233
KANIYAH: You did it!

943
00:41:19,233 --> 00:41:21,100
VALERIE: Aidan, you're the Kids
Baking Champion! Congrat--

944
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:25,067
Thank you.
Come here, you!

945
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,533
Come here.
Come here, you.

946
00:41:26,533 --> 00:41:29,067
AIDAN: I have a whole
butterfly migration

947
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:31,167
going through
my stomach right now.

948
00:41:31,167 --> 00:41:33,633
Aidan, good job, man.
You guys, oh, my God.

949
00:41:33,633 --> 00:41:37,100
Good job.
I'm so proud of all that
I've accomplished here.

950
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:38,633
Kaniyah, I'm coming!

951
00:41:38,633 --> 00:41:40,933
And it's been
an amazing ride

952
00:41:40,933 --> 00:41:42,733
and I can't believe I won.

953
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:45,133
It literally feels
like I'm dreaming.

954
00:41:45,133 --> 00:41:47,067
This was the tightest
it's ever been.

955
00:41:47,067 --> 00:41:49,267
We argued for a long time.

956
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:51,633
All three of you
are amazing bakers.

957
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:53,833
Yeah.
"Kids Baking Championship"!

958
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,867
Woo-hoo!
Yay!

959
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:58,333
AIDAN: You guys did
so great.
