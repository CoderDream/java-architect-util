Tim Cook:
Good morning, and welcome to WWDC.

6
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:09,203
We have a big day of announcements

7
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:12,339
about our latest technologies
and platforms.

8
00:01:12,372 --> 00:01:14,942
These platforms,
and the products they drive,

9
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:18,178
deliver amazing experiences for our users

10
00:01:18,212 --> 00:01:21,682
and provide developers
with incredible opportunities

11
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,452
so they can use their superpowers
to innovate, create,

12
00:01:25,485 --> 00:01:30,624
and collaborate, making apps
that continue to change the world.

13
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,027
And WWDC is designed
to give this community

14
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:37,531
what they need to do their very best work.

15
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:41,268
We love to support our developers
beyond WWDC

16
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:46,874
with comprehensive world-class support
and other important initiatives.

17
00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:51,445
We just opened our brand-new
Developers Center across from Apple Park

18
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:54,448
where developers can engage
with our engineers.

19
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:56,884
And to reach our global community,

20
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:01,955
this past fall we introduced our first
online Tech Talks for developers

21
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:04,825
to learn more about our new technologies

22
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:07,361
and directly connect with Apple engineers

23
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:11,231
in live sessions
and one-on-one office hours.

24
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:16,637
We are also committed to cultivating
the next generation of developers,

25
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,841
including efforts to reach
underrepresented communities.

26
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:25,145
So our developer academies teach
students the fundamentals of coding

27
00:02:25,179 --> 00:02:27,247
as well as the other necessary skills

28
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:31,318
to find and create jobs
in the app economy.

29
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,387
There are 17 around the world

30
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,057
including the academy in Detroit
we founded in October

31
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:41,695
as a part of Apple's Racial Equity
and Justice Initiative.

32
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:47,634
And in Saudi Arabia, we launched our first
developer academy for women in February.

33
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:52,339
Our Entrepreneur Camps provide developers
from underrepresented communities

34
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:56,610
with mentorship, inspiration,
and insights from Apple.

35
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,581
The first camps were for female founders,
and this past year,

36
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:04,718
we expanded the camps
to reach Black and Latin founders.

37
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:07,921
Alumni have gone on
to secure major funding

38
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,724
and see great success on the App Store.

39
00:03:12,059 --> 00:03:16,129
These ongoing efforts empower
all developers with the tools,

40
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:20,434
technologies, and inspiration
to change the world for the better.

41
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:26,473
Last year, many millions of developers
engaged in WWDC,

42
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:30,644
and we expect millions more
to join us again this year.

43
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:34,781
In fact, we're excited to say
we've grown our developer community

44
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:38,886
to over 34 million Apple developers.

45
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:43,590
We have a huge week ahead of us,
with an amazing online experience,

46
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:47,628
including sessions, labs,
and digital lounges,

47
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:51,965
which will all be available for free
to our developers.

48
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:55,269
Today, we're going to push
our platforms further than ever

49
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:58,005

whether you're at home or on the move.

59
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,962
And the next release, iOS 16,
offers new intelligence,

And those come together with an incredible

63
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,777
that will make your experience
feel fresh and completely you.

64
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:14,381
Let's get started
with the all-new Lock Screen.

65
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,685
The Lock Screen is the first thing you see
every time you pick up your iPhone.

66
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,154
It's a place where you can check
the date and time,

67
00:05:21,188 --> 00:05:22,823
look out for key messages,

68
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:25,492
and launch the camera
to quickly capture the moment.

69
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,996
And it's just as much
a place for personalization,

70
00:05:29,029 --> 00:05:33,367
where so many of you put a photo
that makes iPhone uniquely yours.

71
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:38,639
In iOS 16, we're bringing the biggest
update ever to the Lock Screen,

72
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,643
completely reimagining
how it looks and works for you.

00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:31,358
while also giving you new ways
to make it more personal,

79
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,760
beautiful, and helpful than ever.

80
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:35,495
Let me show you.

81
00:06:35,529 --> 00:06:37,030
Here's my Lock Screen.

82
00:06:37,064 --> 00:06:39,266
You'll notice the subtle depth effect

83
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,668
with my daughters appearing
in front of the time.

84
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,036
I really love it.

85
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,541
Now, if I just press and hold,
I can personalize it further.

86
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:50,377
I'll just tap Customize,
and now I'm in the editor.

87
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,678
Now, check this out.

88
00:06:51,712 --> 00:06:55,549
I can simply swipe
to try out different styles

89
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:59,286
that automatically change
the color filter, the background,

90
00:06:59,319 --> 00:07:02,756
and the font for the time,
all to complement each other.

91
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:04,324
These look really beautiful.

92
00:07:04,358 --> 00:07:06,126
So let's go with this one.

93
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,062
Now, of course,
if I want to change anything,

94
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,933
it's easy to dial it in further
to get it just the way I want it.

95
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:17,304
All I need to do is tap on any element
of the Lock Screen to start editing.

96
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,406
So let's customize the font.

97
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,009
I can audition different typefaces

98
00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,045
and choose from different colors.

99
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,182
And I like this color.
I'll just adjust the shade a little bit.

100
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:30,384
I think this looks awesome now.

101
00:07:30,417 --> 00:07:33,253
Now, I can also make my Lock Screen
more helpful

102
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,822
by putting widgets
right on the Lock Screen.

103
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,125
So let me move the girls down here

104
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,361
and tap in to bring up the widget gallery.

105
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:44,831
And these are really useful
for getting information at a glance,

106
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,333
like upcoming calendar events.

107
00:07:46,366 --> 00:07:49,837
So I'll add the temperature,

108
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,441
my Activity rings,
and let's drag in the calendar widget.

109
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,043
Now, this is great.

110
00:07:56,076 --> 00:08:00,414
And what's even better is,
I'm not limited to just one.

111
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,683
Let's create another.

112
00:08:02,716 --> 00:08:04,985
I can bring up
our brand-new wallpaper gallery,

113
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:08,589
which showcases
a bunch of options for inspiration.

114
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:10,524
And there are plenty to choose from here.

115
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:15,395
So much room for personalization,
with millions of combinations.

116
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:20,100
With Photo Shuffle, I can choose a set
of photos to shuffle throughout the day,

117
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,736
And we also have Suggested Photos,

118
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,506
intelligently curated
from my personal library,

119
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,042
like the best shots of family
that look great on the Lock Screen.

120
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,846
Now, this is an awesome one
to add to my collection.

121
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,516
Now, I've created
a bunch of other Lock Screens,

122
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,152
and by simply swiping,
I can switch between them.

123
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:41,221
It's amazing the range you can create.

124
00:08:41,255 --> 00:08:44,458
Here's Weather,
which shows live weather conditions

125
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:46,560
like a downpour and lightning.

126
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,595
I just love this animation.

127
00:08:48,629 --> 00:08:50,998
Here's a really cool emoji wallpaper

128
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:53,300
and our Pride wallpaper.

129
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,103
And here's one
from our Astronomy collection.

130
00:08:56,136 --> 00:09:00,908
Watch how it animates fluidly
as I swipe into the Home Screen.

131
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,242
So cool.

132
00:09:02,276 --> 00:09:06,780
So that's a quick look
at the all-new Lock Screen.

133
00:09:06,813 --> 00:09:09,917
And for developers,
WidgetKit makes it quick and easy

134
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:13,520
to put glanceable information
from their app here as well.

135
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:17,491
The new Lock Screen is so beautiful,
we wanted to make sure

136
00:09:17,524 --> 00:09:21,962
that you can always enjoy it,
even if you get a lot of notifications.

137
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,766
Sometimes, notifications can
cover up your personal photo.

138
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,769
So we've rethought how they appear.

139
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:33,073
Notifications now roll in from the bottom
of the Lock Screen as you receive them,

140
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,342
and you can choose to hide them
throughout the day.

141
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,946
Now, sometimes you get
a bunch of notifications from an app,

142
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,782
like when you're following
the score of a basketball game.

143
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,451
Well, now
there's a better way to keep tabs

144
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,855
with something called Live Activities.

145
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:50,691
Live Activities make it easier
to stay on top of things

146
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,828
that are happening in real time
right from your Lock Screen.

147
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:58,832
And for developers, starting in an update
to iOS 16 later this year,

148
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,368
they can use the Live Activities API

149
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:05,138
to create these compact
and glanceable experiences.

150
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,475
This will make it really easy
to follow that NBA game,

151
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,878
track the progress of an Uber ride,

152
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,481
see how you're doing
on your workout, and more,

153
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:18,185
all while letting the other elements
on the Lock Screen shine.

154
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:22,589
One of the most popular activities
for many of us is listening to music.

155
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:26,126
And now with Live Activities,
the Now Playing controls can expand

156
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,664
to a full screen view that celebrates
album art while you listen along.

157
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,201
So that's the all-new Lock Screen.

158
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,304
There are some really powerful ways
these updates tie together

159
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:41,141
and build upon what we introduced
last year with Focus.

160
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:45,412
Focus has helped people reduce
distractions and stay in the moment.

161
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,848
And this year, we're taking it further,

162
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,151
starting with extending Focus
to your Lock Screen.

163
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:54,388
This means your choice
of a photo and widgets

164
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,924
can all be tied to a particular Focus.

165
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,526
And now that you can have
multiple Lock Screens,

166
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,130
you can match them to the appropriate
Focus throughout your day.

167
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,433
You can have a dedicated one
for when you're in a Work Focus,

168
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,369
with widgets showing your upcoming meeting
or to-do list.

169
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:13,340
Or, with just a swipe,
you can activate your Personal Focus.

170
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,243
All of your corresponding
notification settings apply,

171
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,246
and it extends to your Home Screen too.

172
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,982
So now you can elevate
your favorite apps or widgets

173
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,885
for keeping up with friends and family.

174
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,822
And now, your Focus can also carry
into the apps themselves,

175
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:33,160
with Focus filters, which let you
filter out distracting content.

176
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,162
Let's take Safari, for example.

177
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,497
Instead of seeing all of your websites,

178
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:42,069
you can turn on the Work Focus filter
and see only the tabs that relate to work.

179
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,606
And you can filter
not just tab groups in Safari,

180
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:50,878
but also conversations in Messages,
accounts in Mail, and events in Calendar.

181
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,046
And for developers, we have a new API

182
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,316
so they can help you focus
in their apps as well.

183
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,353
These updates to Focus
can help you draw boundaries

184
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,823
and find balance throughout
all of the moments in your life.

185
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:07,127
Now, let's talk about
what's in store for Messages.

186
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,164
Hundreds of millions of people
rely on Messages every single day.

187
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:15,502
It's integral to how we communicate
with the people who matter most.

188
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:20,040
And now, we're adding three of the most
highly-requested features to Messages.

189
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:24,778
First, have you ever sent a Message
only to immediately realize

190
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,214
you didn't quite say what you intended?

191
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,315
Well, no worries.

192
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,919
Because now you can edit
any message you just sent

193
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:35,589
so embarrassing typos
can be a thing of the past.

194
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:39,927
Second, have you ever wished
you'd never sent that message at all?

195
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,096
Well, good news–now you have undo send,

196
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,500
so you can immediately recall
a recent misfire.

197
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,237
And finally, you can now mark
any thread as unread,

198
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,973
a perfect tool if you don't have time
to respond in the moment

199
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,276
and want to be sure
to come back to a message later.

200
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,079
These three features are going to make
a big difference

201
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,515
in how you use Messages every single day.

202
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:07,888
Messages makes texting easy and efficient,
and it's also a great way to share.

203
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:13,527
Last year, we introduced Shared with You,
which takes things like photos, links,

204
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,064
and music that your friends share
with you in Messages and highlights them

205
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:20,300
right in the app
where you'd like to enjoy them later.

206
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:22,569
And for developers, we're really excited

207
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,539
to make Shared with You
available with a new API.

208
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:29,276
So when someone sends you a funny video,
a worthwhile article,

209
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,246
or a recipe that you don't have time
to check out in the moment,

210
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,582
it'll be there waiting for you
the next time you open that app.

211
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:41,388
And when it comes to sharing in real time
with others, people are loving SharePlay.

212
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,857
It's stellar for enjoying
shared experiences

213
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:45,692
while connecting over FaceTime.

214
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:48,495
Like watching TV shows,
listening to music,

215
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,832
or breaking a sweat
to a synced up workout.

216
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,434
So many of your favorite apps
are using SharePlay

217
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,136
to create shared experiences,

218
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,473
like listening to bedtime stories together
with Better Sleep

219
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:03,443
or playing a rowdy game of Heads Up,
no matter how far apart you are.

220
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:06,213
And this year,
we're making it easier to discover

221
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:10,417
all of these awesome SharePlay experiences
from within your FaceTime call.

222
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,754
With just a tap, you can jump
into SharePlay-supported apps

223
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:17,491
that you already have on your phone,
or discover new experiences

224
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:19,193
that you can share with your friends.

225
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,963
And to give you more opportunities
to enjoy shared experiences,

226
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:27,768
we're extending SharePlay beyond FaceTime
and bringing it to Messages.

227
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,804
This was the number one request
from developers.

228
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,840
Now when you find something
you want to share,

229
00:14:32,873 --> 00:14:37,077
like a movie on Disney+,
you can kick off SharePlay right there

230
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,047
and enjoy it together
while chatting in Messages.

231
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,317
You can watch in sync,
and you've got the same instantaneous

232
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,653
shared playback controls
that make SharePlay magical.

233
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,090
So whether you're using SharePlay
for your weekly movie night

234
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,926
or marking a message unread
so you can respond later,

235
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,897
Messages has everything you need
to connect with ease.

236
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,701
And we're making it that much easier
to compose Messages

237
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,103
with some updates to Dictation.

238
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,572
To tell you more, here's Robby.

239
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,245
Robby Walker:
Dictation lets you type just by speaking

240
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,581
and can be much faster
than typing with the Keyboard.

241
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:19,419
This is why it's so popular for taking
notes, sending messages, and more.

242
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:24,291
In fact, Dictation is used
over 18 billion times each month.

243
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,427
And it's designed to protect your privacy.

244
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:32,132
Thanks to the Neural Engine,
Dictation can happen entirely on-device.

245
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:37,905
Today, we're excited to introduce
an all-new on-device Dictation experience

246
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,875
that lets you fluidly move
between voice and touch.

247
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,710
Let's take a look.

248
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:47,648
We'll use our new dictation experience
to send an email.

249
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,385
Now, when I start dictating,
the keyboard stays open,

250
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,755
so I can switch
between using voice and touch.

251
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:04,665
I can even select text using touch
and replace it with my voice.

252
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,903
Just by speaking.

253
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,439
Are you sending a longer message?

254
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,243
Dictation automatically adds
punctuation to the text.

255
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,981
"That's so cool! Mind blown emoji!"

256
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:24,818
Automatic punctuation
and emoji dictation also work

257
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,754
when you send messages with Siri.

258
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:31,959
And this year, we're making it easier
to use Siri with apps.

259
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,662
There are over 15,000 apps
that work with Siri

260
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,131
using SiriKit and Siri Shortcuts.

261
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,468
And today, these require manual setup.

262
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,638
So we're introducing a new developer API

263
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,075
built using the Swift programming language
called App Intents.

264
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,044
Now shortcuts work with zero setup

265
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,615
so you can use Siri to get things done
with supported apps.

266
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:59,386
Now let's talk about another feature
powered by intelligence: Live Text.

267
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,154
Live Text is so useful

268
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,424
because it's deeply integrated
across the entire OS,

269
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,095
letting you interact with text
in images across the system,

270
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:12,499
from Camera and Safari
to Notes and Screenshots.

271
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:16,270
And this year, we're excited
to take this integration further

272
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,839
by bringing Live Text to video.

273
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,310
Now you can pause a video
on any frame and interact with text

274
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,812
just like you can today with photos.

275
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,448
It's great for copying code samples.

276
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:33,453
We're also accelerating the things you do
with Live Text with quick actions.

277
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:36,690
So now you're just a tap away
from converting currency

278
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,659
and translating a foreign language.

279
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:42,162
And for an even richer
translation experience,

280
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:45,532
you'll be able to use Live Text
while in the Translate app,

281
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,701
with our new camera view.

282
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,838
This will be great for when you have
lots of text to translate.

283
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:55,676
And for developers, we're also excited
to announce a Live Text API.

284
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:59,613
Soon you will be able to grab text
straight from photos

285
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,216
and videos in apps like Vimeo.

286
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,152
And photos are about more than just text.

287
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,121
That's why last year
we introduced Visual Look Up,

288
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:13,193
a feature that recognizes objects like
pets, landmarks, plants, and more,

289
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:16,897
and gives you rich information
about what's in your images.

290
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,134
And this year we have a new feature
that takes image understanding further.

291
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,472
Now when you touch and hold
on the subject of an image,

292
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:29,910
you can lift it away from the background
and place it in apps like Messages.

293
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,979
It feels like magic.

294
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,982
It's actually the product
of an advanced machine learning model

295
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:37,251
which is accelerated by CoreML

296
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,487
and the Neural Engine to perform
40 billion operations

297
00:18:40,521 --> 00:18:42,055
in just milliseconds.

298
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:46,660
Together, Live Text and Visual Look Up
continue to unlock

299
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:50,564
rich and useful information
from your photos and videos

300
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:54,168
across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS.

301
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,602
Back to you, Craig.

302
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:01,608
Craig: These intelligence features
help you get things done with ease.

303
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:05,312
And another app that makes life easier
is Wallet.

304
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,183
To tell you about what's new in Wallet,
I'll hand it over to Corey.

305
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,921
Corey Fugman:
With Apple Wallet, we're working hard

306
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,823
on our goal to replace
your physical wallet.

307
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,127
Take what we're doing
with driver's licenses and ID cards.

308
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,863
We're excited to have launched
Maryland and Arizona,

309
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,400
with 11 additional states
actively working on deployments.

310
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,536
And the first locations
now accepting Wallet IDs

311
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,005
are select TSA security checkpoints.

312
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,942
You'll also be able
to securely present your ID

313
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:38,378
to apps requiring identity
and age verification.

314
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:42,816
To protect your privacy, only the
necessary information will be shared.

315
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,485
So rather than providing
your exact birthday,

316
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,055
you can simply share that you are over 21.

317
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,424
Now, let's talk about Keys.

318
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:55,095
Our growing suite of keys in Wallet
makes it easy to access everyday places

319
00:19:55,128 --> 00:20:00,634
like your home, car, hotel, and office,
all with just your iPhone.

320
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,504
And now we're making sharing keys
even easier

321
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:08,075
with your favorite messaging apps
like Mail, Messages, or WhatsApp.

322
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:11,111
When your friend receives the key,
they can add it to their Wallet

323
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:12,346
with a single tap.

324
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,549
And to let you share keys with people
who don't have an iPhone,

325
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:19,486
we're working with the IETF to make
sharing keys an industry standard

326
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,522
that is free for others to adopt.

327
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,958
We are seeing tremendous enthusiasm
from our partners,

328
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:29,062
with more of them signing on to support
keys for all of the places you visit.

329
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:33,700
Now let's talk about Apple Pay,
one of the most important areas of Wallet.

330
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:36,203
We've made a lot of progress
with Apple Pay acceptance

331
00:20:36,236 --> 00:20:40,474
in stores and online,
and now we're expanding even further.

332
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:43,343
Starting this month
with Tap to Pay on iPhone,

333
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:47,548
millions of merchants across the U.S.
can accept contactless payments

334
00:20:47,581 --> 00:20:52,519
directly on iPhone with no additional
hardware or payment terminal needed.

335
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,055
Beginning with apps
from these payment providers,

336
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,992
Tap to Pay on iPhone enables
small merchants and large retailers

337
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:02,062
to use iPhone to securely accept payments.

338
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:06,200
In addition to expanded acceptance,
we're also enhancing Apple Pay

339
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,402
to support new types of payments.

340
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,039
So we are thrilled to announce
Apple Pay Later.

341
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,742
Apple Pay Later lets you split the cost
of an Apple Pay purchase

342
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,179
into four equal payments
spread over six weeks

343
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:22,382
with zero interest
and no fees of any kind.

344
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,353
And Apple Pay Later is available
everywhere Apple Pay is accepted

345
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,921
in apps and online.

346
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,457
You can now get that espresso machine
you've wanted

347
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:33,794
and pay for it over time
with no additional cost.

348
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:38,365
For developers and merchants,
Apple Pay Later requires no integration.

349
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,969
It just works using their
standard Apple Pay implementation.

350
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,771
Upcoming payments are managed
through Wallet,

351
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,508
making it easy to keep track
of what's due when

352
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,510
and to stay within a budget.

353
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,445
And after you've placed your order,

354
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,248
we have another brand-new feature
that helps you track it.

355
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:56,750
Apple Pay Order Tracking enables merchants

356
00:21:56,783 --> 00:22:01,355
to deliver detailed receipt and tracking
information directly to Wallet,

357
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,724
making it easy to get
the latest information

358
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:08,829
on all of your Apple Pay orders delivered
securely and privately to your device.

359
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:12,266
Apple Pay Order Tracking will be
offered at millions of merchants

360
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,068
through eCommerce platforms
starting with Shopify.

361
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:18,705
So that's our Wallet update.
Back to you, Craig.

362
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,242
Craig: With ID cards available
in more locations,

363
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,912
new ways to use and share keys,

364
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,814
Apple Pay Later,
and Apple Pay Order Tracking,

365
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:31,585
Wallet makes life so much easier,
no matter where you go.

366
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:35,656
And the best way to get wherever
you're going is with Maps.

367
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,825
So let's get out of here
to talk about what's new.

368
00:22:38,859 --> 00:22:45,866
♪ ♪

369
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:54,508
We're building the best map to help you
navigate and explore the world.

370
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:58,545
We've launched our redesigned map
in ten countries and regions,

371
00:22:58,579 --> 00:23:01,048
and we're excited to announce
that later this year,

372
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:04,518
we'll bring the new map to 11 more,
including France,

373
00:23:04,551 --> 00:23:06,720
Switzerland, and New Zealand.

374
00:23:06,753 --> 00:23:12,159
Our new map includes great features like
cycling, Look Around, and so many more.

375
00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:15,829
And with the new city experience,
we pushed it even further

376
00:23:15,863 --> 00:23:20,400
with unprecedented detail for landcover,
roads, and elevation,

377
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:24,271
as well as improved driving
and transit navigation.

378
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:28,709
And we're adding Las Vegas,
which looks stunning.

379
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,879
And before the end of the year,
we'll add six more cities

380
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,349
including Miami, Chicago, and Sydney.

381
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,986
To tell you more about what's new in Maps,
here's Meg.

382
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:45,526
Meg Frost: With iOS 16,
we're introducing great updates

383
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,529
for Maps users and developers.

384
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:51,798
Let's start with one of our most
requested features:

385
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,734
multistop routing.

386
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,504
You can now plan
up to 15 stops in advance.

387
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:02,409
Maps will now store previous routes
in Recents so they're easy to get back to

388
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,279
and you can plan multi-stop routes
on the Mac

389
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:08,081
and send them to iPhone
when you're ready to go.

390
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,017
And, of course,
when you're driving,

391
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,053
you can ask Siri to add additional stops
to your route

392
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:16,023
while safely keeping your eyes
on the road.

393
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:20,060
Next, let's talk about
getting around with transit.

394
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:23,163
We're making it easy
for riders to see fares

395
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,232
for how much their journey will cost

396
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,402
along with the ability
to add transit cards to Wallet.

397
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:31,305
And if a transit card balance is
running low

398
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,673
, you'll receive an alert

399
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:35,909
so you can reload it
without having to leave Maps.

400
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:40,414
And for developers,
we're making big improvements to MapKit,

401
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,984
starting with our
revolutionary new city experience

402
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:50,023
which includes rich details for landcover,
roads, landmarks, and more.

403
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,861
Developers like Bird can now integrate
this detailed map

404
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:58,832
so users can more easily locate bikes
and scooters to get around town.

405
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:03,136
And it looks stunning
in both Light and Dark Mode.

406
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,938
And there's more.

407
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,774
We're also bringing Look Around to MapKit,

408
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:11,778
making it easy to integrate
high resolution imagery from Maps

409
00:25:11,812 --> 00:25:13,647
into apps like Zillow,

410
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,019
helping users get an immersive
ground-level view while browsing homes.

411
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:23,123
And finally, we're excited to announce
that later this year,

412
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,260
developers will have faster
and more flexible ways

413
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:32,566
to build incredible Maps experiences
with brand-new server-side APIs.

414
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,801
And that's a quick look at Maps.

415
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,837
Back to you, Craig!

416
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:42,176
Craig: Now, let's talk about sports.

417
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,112
Sports can bring people together
in meaningful ways,

418
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:47,447
whether a heated rivalry among friends

419
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,950
or a whole town rooting for their team.

420
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:55,222
And at Apple, we want to create great
experiences for sports fans everywhere.

421
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,292
To tell you more, here's Rubie.

422
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:04,698
♪ ♪

423
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:08,902
Rubie Edmondson: Today, there are many
ways to keep up with your favorite sports,

424
00:26:08,936 --> 00:26:12,539
like being able to ask Siri
about players or teams

425
00:26:12,573 --> 00:26:15,843
or see live games,
no matter where they're streaming.

426
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:20,480
And now with Live Activities,
the Apple TV app brings you scores

427
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:23,784
and play-by-play action
right on your Lock Screen.

428
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:27,821
We also recently premiered
Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+

429
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:31,158
where you can stream
two great games every Friday.

430
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:36,530
And today, we have another major update
for sports in Apple News.

431
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:40,133
Apple News is the number one news app
everywhere it's available,

432
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,337
and it's about to become amazing
for sports fans.

433
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,807
You can now follow your favorite teams
and leagues to get stories

434
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,613
from hundreds of the best publishers
in an all-new section called My Sports.

435
00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:56,550
You'll also find scores, schedules,
and standings for the top professional

436
00:26:56,583 --> 00:27:00,654
and college sports leagues,
and highlights too.

437
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:05,659
Now you can catch the best plays from your
favorite teams right in your news feed.

438
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:09,162
And your favorites are seamlessly synced
with the Apple TV app

439
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,832
and across all your Apple devices.

440
00:27:11,865 --> 00:27:14,301
This new sports experience is free.

441
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:19,139
It'll be available in the U.S.,
UK, Canada, and Australia.

442
00:27:19,173 --> 00:27:21,508
And when you subscribe to Apple News+,

443
00:27:21,542 --> 00:27:25,212
you'll get premium sports coverage
from many local newspapers.

444
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:29,249
That's Sports.
Back to you, Craig.

445
00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:33,787
Craig: iOS and the entire Apple ecosystem
are amazing for families,

446
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,490
and we have some great new features
to talk about,

447
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,860
starting with some updates
to Family Sharing.

448
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,563
With Family Sharing,
you can share your favorite purchases

449
00:27:42,596 --> 00:27:45,532
and subscriptions with up to five
of your family members,

450
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:50,771
including Apple Music, iCloud+,
Apple One, and much more.

451
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:54,675
Everyone gets personalized access
to their favorite content

452
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:57,911
without having to buy their own
subscriptions or share an account.

453
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:02,416
And for households with kids,
you can create accounts just for them

454
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:06,220
with built-in parental controls
to help you monitor their screen time

455
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,788
or approve their purchases.

456
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:12,226
And this year, we're making it even easier
to create accounts for kids

457
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:16,897
and make sure the right parental controls
are in place right from the start.

458
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,133
We're adding a new, easy way
to set age-appropriate restrictions

459
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,504
for apps, movies, books, and music.

460
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,773
Along with quick setup
of other important parental controls.

461
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:29,843
We're also making setting up
a new device for your child–

462
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,112
like an iPad–really simple.

463
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:35,682
Just turn on the device they'll be using,
bring your iPhone nearby,

464
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:38,585
and choose to set up with Quick Start.

465
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,822
With just a few taps, the new device
will be set up for their use

466
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:46,460
with all the parental controls
you've selected already configured.

467
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,629
And when your child asks
for more screen time,

468
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:52,299
you won't have to navigate to Settings
to approve or deny their request.

469
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:55,068
You can now respond right in Messages.

470
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:59,773
Finally, we've added a new
Family Checklist with helpful tips

471
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,609
like updating a child's settings
as they get older,

472
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,444
turning on location sharing,

473
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:09,149
or just reminding you that you can share
your iCloud+ subscription with everyone.

474
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:14,655
So those are some of the helpful updates
to Family Sharing this year.

475
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:17,558
Now, as we all know, one of the things

476
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:21,028
everyone enjoys sharing
with their family is photos.

477
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:25,899
So this year, we're introducing a better
way to share photos with your family.

478
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,503
Our precious memories are
often captured by several people

479
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:34,208
and in between personal photos of hobbies,
house projects, and homework,

480
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:38,212
we have photos on our device that
everyone in the family would like to have.

481
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,713
But no one has all of them,

482
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,783
so the family's memories
are never complete.

483
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,084
Until now.

484
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:47,421
We're introducing
iCloud Shared Photo Library

485
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,158
to help you share photos seamlessly
and even automatically.

486
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,559
It's easy to set up.

487
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:55,829
It's a separate iCloud library
that everyone can contribute to,

488
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:58,232
collaborate on, and enjoy.

489
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,200
You can participate in one shared library

490
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:02,636
that's shared
with up to five other people.

491
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,939
We've made it simple to share just
the photos you want from your library.

492
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:08,809
You can share everything
already in your library,

493
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:12,980
or choose what to include based on
a start date or the people in the photos.

494
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:15,682
For example, you can choose
to include just the photos

495
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:18,418
where you were together with your partner
and the kids.

496
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,320
Once the Shared Library is set up,

497
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,857
you can manually move over new photos
after you take them.

498
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:27,861
But we wanted to make it even easier
with a new switch right in Camera

499
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:31,632
that sends shots straight to
the Shared Library as you take them.

500
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:34,868
This is great when you're on a vacation
and you want to make sure

501
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:37,504
the photos are shared right away.

502
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:40,240
And if you take a photo
of something personal, like a gift,

503
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,142
you can easily turn it off.

504
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,846
You can also choose to have
the sharing switch enabled automatically

505
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:49,783
whenever you take shots with other
members of the Shared Library nearby.

506
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:53,120
So if you take photos on a camping trip,
you don't have to remember

507
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:54,688
to share them later.

508
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:59,059
You'll also receive intelligent
sharing suggestions in the For You tab.

509
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:01,929
Everyone has equal permissions
for adding, editing,

510
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:04,331
and deleting photos in the Shared Library.

511
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,167
So if one member of the group
is a talented photo editor,

512
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,337
everyone gets to enjoy their edits
to the shared photos.

513
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,073
Deletions, captions,
and keywords sync too.

514
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:16,810
Content in the Shared Library
will appear in everyone's Memories,

515
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:19,646
Featured Photos, and in the Photos widget.

516
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,851
So you can relive your family's adventures
that include all the photos.

517
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,954
That's iCloud Shared Photo Library:

518
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:29,690
the best way to share photos
with your family.

519
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:33,360
And last, let's talk about privacy.

520
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,798
We're always working hard to protect
our users and their privacy,

521
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:41,969
with features like App Privacy Report,
Mail Privacy Protection,

522
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:45,339
App Tracking Transparency,
Privacy Nutrition Labels,

523
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,107
and so many more.

524
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,079
Another critically important area
is protecting our users' personal safety.

525
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,681
One way we're doing that
is by adding a new tool

526
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:57,451
to help people quickly turn off
others' access,

527
00:31:57,484 --> 00:32:02,222
for example, disabling location sharing if
they're escaping an abusive relationship.

528
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,358
It's called Safety Check.

529
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,660
To tell you about it, here's Katie.

530
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:12,266
Katie Skinner:
Many people share passwords

531
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,902
and access to their devices
with their partner.

532
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:19,273
However, in abusive relationships,
this can threaten personal safety

533
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:22,376
and make it harder for victims
to get help.

534
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:24,978
We've been working closely
with organizations

535
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:28,949
that support victims of domestic
and intimate partner violence.

536
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:32,953
And the result of those conversations
is Safety Check,

537
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:37,691
a new section in Settings where you can
quickly review and reset the access

538
00:32:37,724 --> 00:32:39,159
you've granted others.

539
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:44,364
This lets people in abusive situations
quickly revoke an abuser's access

540
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:45,966
to their data and location,

541
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:49,803
enabling them to cut ties
and get to safety.

542
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:54,308
Safety Check stops sharing your location
with others via FindMy

543
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:59,079
and resets the system privacy
permissions for all apps.

544
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:03,584
It also protects access to your messages
by helping you sign out of iCloud

545
00:33:03,617 --> 00:33:05,953
on all your other devices

546
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,356
and restricts Messages and FaceTime
to the device in your hand.

547
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,761
Safety Check also helps you manage
who you've given access to.

548
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:18,498
And you can audit which permissions
you've granted to certain apps.

549
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:22,202
We've received some really positive
feedback on our approach,

550
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:25,005
including from
the National Center for Victims of Crime

551
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:28,408
who said: "In times of crisis,
for many survivors,

552
00:33:28,442 --> 00:33:32,646
"it's important to know
who has their information and location.

553
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,216
Safety Check helps
give control back to survivors."

554
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,252
This is important work,

555
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:42,256
expanding the ways
iOS helps you stay safe.

556
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,992
Now, back to you, Craig.

557
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:48,595
Craig: Protecting you and your privacy
is and will always be

558
00:33:48,629 --> 00:33:51,465
at the center of what we do.

559
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:57,738
iOS 16 offers so many updates that will
change the way you experience iPhone.

560
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,741
iOS also extends that experience
beyond the phone,

561
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:03,877
to enhance how you interact
with the world around you.

562
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:06,313
Whether helping you through
your morning routine

563
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,982
or keeping you connected
on your next road trip,

564
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,552
iOS has you covered.

565
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:16,290
This year we're bringing exciting updates
to your home and your car.

566
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:19,560
To tell you what's new in the home,
here's Corey.

567
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:26,600
♪ ♪

568
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:34,708
Corey Wang: Our home is perhaps
the most important place in our lives,

569
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,710
and there's a lot to manage.

570
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:39,046
Smart home accessories can make it easier

571
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:42,382
and more convenient to control your home
right from your iPhone.

572
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,853
You can do things like see who's
at the door while working at your desk,

573
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:49,489
or turn off the lights downstairs
without getting out of bed.

574
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:50,924
And when you're away from home,

575
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,160
you can double-check
if the front door is locked

576
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:57,164
or adjust the temperature
so it's just right when you get back.

577
00:34:57,197 --> 00:34:59,233
And your smart home
is all the more powerful

578
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:03,704
when your accessories work together,
reacting to changes automatically.

579
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:06,006
Now, the smart home is still
in its early days,

580
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,575
and we want to help bring
these powerful experiences

581
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,511
to as many homes as possible.

582
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,147
In order to build a connected
ecosystem at home,

583
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:16,617
it's important that you have
the most choice

584
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,253
so you don't have to worry
about what works with what.

585
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:22,923
With that in mind, we joined forces
with other industry leaders

586
00:35:22,956 --> 00:35:25,792
to create a new smart home
connectivity standard.

587
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:27,794
It's called Matter.

588
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:32,533
Matter enables smart home accessories
to work together across platforms.

589
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,968
And to ensure we stayed true
to our values,

590
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,905
we contributed HomeKit,
our smart home framework,

591
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:40,374
as a foundation of this new standard,

592
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,576
so it's built on the same core principles

593
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,712
and maintains
the highest level of security.

594
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:48,882
Industry-leading brands have
already committed to supporting Matter,

595
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:53,754
with over 130 products in the pipeline,
and that's just the beginning.

596
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:56,523
The Matter standard provides
the underlying foundation

597
00:35:56,557 --> 00:36:01,495
to connect smart home accessories,
and it allows us to innovate on top of it.

598
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:02,796
We take privacy further,

599
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:06,433
ensuring that data about how you use
your accessories is processed

600
00:36:06,466 --> 00:36:10,804
and stored by default in a way
that even Apple can't see.

601
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:14,508
With Matter, we can continue to create
amazing experiences in the Home app

602
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,277
while also making sure
all your different accessories

603
00:36:17,311 --> 00:36:20,380
are consistently simple to set up
and easy to use.

604
00:36:20,414 --> 00:36:23,217
And now that you’ll have more
accessory options to choose from,

605
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:25,853
let's check out how we made
the experience even better

606
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:27,754
with an all-new Home app.

607
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:32,059
We reimagined it from the ground up
starting with the underlying architecture

608
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:34,228
so it's more efficient and reliable,

609
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:37,264
especially for homes
with many accessories.

610
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:41,301
We also completely redesigned
how you navigate, organize,

611
00:36:41,335 --> 00:36:45,639
and view accessories to make it easier
to control your smart home.

612
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:49,109
We've integrated your rooms and favorites
into the main tab of the app.

613
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:52,479
So you can see your entire home
in a single view.

614
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:55,482
And we made sure it looks great,
whether you're just getting started

615
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:58,318
or have built out
an advanced connected home.

616
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:03,390
We added new categories for climate,
lights, security, and more

617
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:06,126
and an overview of what's happening
in each category

618
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,794
right at the top of the screen.

619
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:11,398
And categories are a great way
to navigate within the app.

620
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:15,736
When you tap on a specific category,
you see all the relevant accessories

621
00:37:15,769 --> 00:37:20,007
organized by room
and more detailed status information.

622
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,511
A multi-camera view displays up to
four cameras at once front and center,

623
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:27,514
and you can scroll to the right
to see any additional cameras.

624
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:30,817
We also redesigned tiles
so that different accessories

625
00:37:30,851 --> 00:37:33,987
are more visually recognizable
through shape and color.

626
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:37,057
And with the new widgets
on the Lock Screen, it's easier than ever

627
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,825
to see how your home is doing.

628
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:43,997
So that's the all-new Home app,
and it's coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac.

629
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:47,067
Now that you have what you need
to keep tabs on your home,

630
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,635
you're ready to hit the road.

631
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:51,505
Let's hand it off to Emily
to talk about CarPlay.

632
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:58,111
Emily Schubert: CarPlay is the smarter,
safer way to use your iPhone in the car

633
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:02,850
and has fundamentally changed the way
people interact with their vehicles.

634
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:07,020
It's available
on over 98% of cars in the U.S.

635
00:38:07,054 --> 00:38:10,958
What's more, 79% of U.S. buyers

636
00:38:10,991 --> 00:38:14,394
would only consider a car
that works with CarPlay.

637
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:18,365
It's a must-have feature
when shopping for a new vehicle.

638
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:20,701
Our users love CarPlay.

639
00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:23,737
It gives them an easy way
to use apps in the car,

640
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,040
using the familiar UI from their iPhone.

641
00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,976
But cars have changed a lot,

642
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:33,080
with larger-sized screens
and more of them throughout the car.

643
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:39,019
There's an opportunity for iPhone
to play an even more important role.

644
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:44,291
We've been working with automakers
to reinvent the in-car experience

645
00:38:44,324 --> 00:38:46,960
across all of the driver's screens.

646
00:38:46,994 --> 00:38:51,798
Let's take a sneak peek
at this next generation of CarPlay.

647
00:38:53,166 --> 00:39:00,174
♪ ♪

648
00:39:09,416 --> 00:39:15,189
♪ ♪

649
00:39:15,222 --> 00:39:17,591
There's so much to explore here.

650
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:19,226
Let's take a closer look.

651
00:39:19,259 --> 00:39:25,299
This next generation of CarPlay provides
content for all the driver's screens,

652
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:29,403
giving an experience
that is unified and consistent.

653
00:39:29,436 --> 00:39:33,574
It's the very best
of both your car and your iPhone.

654
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:37,110
And it goes beyond what you can do
with CarPlay today.

655
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:42,349
Deep integration with the car's hardware
lets you tune your car's radio

656
00:39:42,382 --> 00:39:48,589
or change your temperature without ever
leaving the CarPlay experience.

657
00:39:48,622 --> 00:39:52,392
It also includes widgets,
powered by your iPhone,

658
00:39:52,426 --> 00:39:55,295
that fit your screens perfectly.

659
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:59,099
They can live front and center
in the gauge cluster as well,

660
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:02,436
giving you information at a glance.

661
00:40:02,469 --> 00:40:08,275
In fact, this next generation of CarPlay
powers your entire instrument cluster.

662
00:40:08,308 --> 00:40:11,478
To do this, your iPhone communicates

663
00:40:11,512 --> 00:40:14,114
with your vehicle's real-time systems

664
00:40:14,147 --> 00:40:18,318
in an on-device, privacy-friendly way,

665
00:40:18,352 --> 00:40:23,357
showing all of your driving information
like speed, RPMs,

666
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:25,959
fuel level, temperature, and more.

667
00:40:25,993 --> 00:40:31,331
And no matter what type of unique
screen shapes or layouts you may have,

668
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:34,535
this next generation of CarPlay feels like

669
00:40:34,568 --> 00:40:38,672
it was made specifically for your car.

670
00:40:38,705 --> 00:40:41,041
We're also excited to give you the ability

671
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:46,079
to make the core of the driving experience
unique to you.

672
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:49,850
We carefully crafted
instrument cluster options

673
00:40:49,883 --> 00:40:53,153
ranging from the modern
to the traditional,

674
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:55,389
that use different colors,

675
00:40:55,422 --> 00:40:58,692
dial treatments, backgrounds, and layouts

676
00:40:58,725 --> 00:41:01,695
to provide various looks and feels.

677
00:41:01,728 --> 00:41:06,633
You can choose different curated themes
and styles for your gauges.

678
00:41:06,667 --> 00:41:10,804
And automakers
from around the world are excited

679
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:14,341
to bring this new vision of CarPlay
to customers.

680
00:41:14,374 --> 00:41:19,446
This is just a taste of what
the next generation of CarPlay will bring.

681
00:41:19,479 --> 00:41:23,383
Vehicles will start to be announced
late next year,

682
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:28,155
and we can't wait to show you more
further down the road.

683
00:41:28,188 --> 00:41:30,858
And now, I'll hand it back to Craig.

684
00:41:30,891 --> 00:41:33,460
Craig: And that's iOS 16,

685
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:38,398
a mighty release that gives you
entirely new ways to make iOS your own.

686
00:41:38,432 --> 00:41:42,769
It also helps you stay in touch with ease,
engage with the world around you,

687
00:41:42,803 --> 00:41:47,040
and seamlessly share experiences
and memories with your family and friends.

688
00:41:47,074 --> 00:41:48,609
And that's just the beginning.

689
00:41:48,642 --> 00:41:52,713
We've also made a big advancement
in Spatial Audio with AirPods.

690
00:41:52,746 --> 00:41:55,816
Now, Spatial Audio works by understanding
how sound interacts

691
00:41:55,849 --> 00:41:58,719
with the geometry of your head and ears.

692
00:41:58,752 --> 00:42:03,056
And now, in iOS 16, you can use
the True Depth camera on iPhone

693
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:06,560
to create a personalized
Spatial Audio profile,

694
00:42:06,593 --> 00:42:08,762
enabling an even more precise

695
00:42:08,795 --> 00:42:12,599
and immersive listening experience,
tuned just for you.

696
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:17,070
Plus, Quick Note is coming to iOS
so you can capture ideas instantly.

697
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:19,673
A new rapid security response mechanism

698
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,876
gets important improvements
to iPhone faster,

699
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:27,047
and you've got more Memoji customizations
to choose from.

700
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:31,451
And there's so many more features to meet
your needs no matter where you are.

701
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:33,387
Now, I’ll hand it over to Kevin

702
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:37,591
to tell you about the big new advancements
coming to Apple Watch.

703
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:44,631
♪ ♪

704
00:42:47,434 --> 00:42:49,803
Kevin Lynch: Let's talk about watchOS.

705
00:42:49,837 --> 00:42:53,040
Apple Watch continues to be
the most loved watch in the world,

706
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:56,677
because it helps you stay connected,
active, and healthy.

707
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:01,682
In watchOS 9 we're bringing great
new features to each of these three areas.

708
00:43:01,715 --> 00:43:04,985
First, you can stay connected
to what matters to you most

709
00:43:05,018 --> 00:43:07,087
just by glancing at your wrist,

710
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,656
whether you use
the popular Photos watch face,

711
00:43:09,690 --> 00:43:11,525
or a face with rich complications.

712
00:43:11,558 --> 00:43:14,761
And we're adding four new watch faces
for you to choose from.

713
00:43:14,795 --> 00:43:19,833
The Astronomy face has been remastered to
take advantage of the expansive display,

714
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:23,303
and shows current cloud coverage
around the world.

715
00:43:23,337 --> 00:43:26,139
The Lunar calendar is used
to observe traditional holidays

716
00:43:26,173 --> 00:43:28,809
and special events in many cultures.

717
00:43:28,842 --> 00:43:32,246
The Lunar watch face celebrates
this thousand-year-old practice

718
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,916
with support for Chinese,
Islamic, and Hebrew calendars.

719
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:39,620
Play Time, designed by artist Joi Fulton,

720
00:43:39,653 --> 00:43:41,688
features whimsical animated numbers.

721
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:44,358
You can tap the display
to send them bouncing around,

722
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,361
and when you lower your wrist,
they take a nap.

723
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:51,598
Finally, Metropolitan highlights
watch typography with a new font

724
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:55,135
that dynamically stretches
when you rotate the digital crown,

725
00:43:55,169 --> 00:43:57,938
and features
many lovely color combinations.

726
00:43:57,971 --> 00:44:02,543
Rich complications enable you to see
more information in a small space,

727
00:44:02,576 --> 00:44:05,445
and we're bringing these
to more of our watch faces.

728
00:44:06,213 --> 00:44:12,352
watchOS 9 also introduces a refreshed
Siri UI and new banner notifications.

729
00:44:12,386 --> 00:44:16,223
And active apps will be pinned
to the top of the Dock for quick access.

730
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:19,826
Another way to stay connected
is by listening to the latest stories,

731
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,962
or sharing your favorite content.

732
00:44:21,995 --> 00:44:25,899
With watchOS 9,
the Podcast app allows you to discover

733
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:30,237
and follow new podcasts
using Search and Listen Now.

734
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:34,174
And the app is now available to kids
using Family Setup.

735
00:44:34,208 --> 00:44:38,879
For developers, sharing content and
selected images from apps like Outcast

736
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:43,717
and WeChat is easier with the new
Share Sheet and Photos Picker APIs.

737
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:47,521
And with CallKit, you can start,
end, or mute VoIP calls from apps

738
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:50,657
like Webex directly on Apple Watch.

739
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:54,461
That's some of what's coming
in watchOS 9 to keep you connected.

740
00:44:54,494 --> 00:44:57,865
And now to Craig to tell you
what's coming to keep you active.

741
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:05,672
Craig Bolton: The Workout app
is one of the most popular apps,

742
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:09,610
so in watchOS 9,
we're bringing new easy-to-use metrics,

743
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:14,982
views, and training experiences
inspired by high-performing athletes,

744
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:17,050
starting with running.

745
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:19,753
It's a sport that,
no matter what your level,

746
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:23,190
you can use metrics to better understand
your performance.

747
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:27,661
And switching up your training
can reduce the chance of getting injured.

748
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:32,633
The first thing we're doing is adding
three new running form metrics

749
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:35,068
to track how efficiently you run.

750
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:38,005
Measuring these from the wrist isn't easy.

751
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:40,440
Take vertical oscillation for example,

752
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:44,044
which is a measure of how much
you move up and down.

753
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:47,748
If it's too high, your energy
might be wasted going up

754
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:50,117
versus propelling you forward.

755
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,085
In order to capture this from the wrist,

756
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,555
we need to extrapolate your torso movement

757
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,491
from the distinctive style
of your arm swing.

758
00:45:57,524 --> 00:46:00,627
We use machine learning
and sensor fusion–

759
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:03,730
a combination of accelerometer
and gyroscope–

760
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,866
to isolate your torso movement,

761
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:09,469
and then measure how much
vertical oscillation is produced.

762
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:14,208
We use a similar approach to measure
the two other Running Form metrics–

763
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:17,811
stride length and ground contact time.

764
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:22,382
These metrics can be added
to new easy-to-read Workout views.

765
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:25,853
Each Workout view
lets you see more at a glance.

766
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:28,922
Scroll the digital crown to see new views

767
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:31,425
for familiar metrics like segments,

768
00:46:31,458 --> 00:46:34,027
splits, and elevation.

769
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,830
And we're introducing heart rate zones

770
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:39,233
so you can quickly see
what zone you're in

771
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:44,004
and get a sense of your intensity level
at any point during your workout.

772
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:46,373
There's also a new custom workout

773
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:49,076
that you can use
to add structure into your run.

774
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:53,280
For example, if you are trying
to improve your speed or endurance,

775
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:56,550
you can create a workout
using distance and time intervals

776
00:46:56,583 --> 00:47:01,221
that include sets of work and recovery
which you can repeat as needed.

777
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:06,026
You can also add one of the new alerts
to a specific part of your workout–

778
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:09,062
like one to monitor which heart rate zone
you want to train in

779
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:11,231
to help keep you on track.

780
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:14,201
During your run,
these alerts will guide you

781
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,837
with both haptics and voice feedback,

782
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,607
letting you know when to switch
between work and recovery

783
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:24,545
and when to pick up the pace
if your heart rate falls below

784
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:26,547
the target zone that you set.

785
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,550
During your run,
you can use the Digital Crown

786
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:33,587
for additional workout views
like this new power metric.

787
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:37,191
Running with a power target
can help you go the distance

788
00:47:37,224 --> 00:47:41,295
by keeping your effort in a range
that you can reasonably sustain.

789
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:45,666
You can even see how this workout
is contributing to your Activity rings.

790
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:49,136
And if it's a route you do often,
it will be automatically saved

791
00:47:49,169 --> 00:47:53,607
in the Workout app for you to race
against your last or best time.

792
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,778
That way, you can see if all the training
you're doing is paying off.

793
00:47:57,811 --> 00:48:01,348
You can use many of these new features
not just when you're running,

794
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:04,251
but for many workout types like Hiking,

795
00:48:04,284 --> 00:48:06,820
HIIT, and Functional Strength Training.

796
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:11,191
And for our triathletes,
there's a new multi-sport workout type

797
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:15,095
that uses sensor fusion to detect
when you finish one leg of your race

798
00:48:15,128 --> 00:48:17,464
and are transitioning to the next.

799
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:22,703
So it can automatically switch
between swimming, cycling, and running.

800
00:48:22,736 --> 00:48:28,275
That's just some of what's coming
to the Workout app in watchOS 9.

801
00:48:28,308 --> 00:48:31,879
Since the first Apple Watch,
we've been inspired by the stories

802
00:48:31,912 --> 00:48:37,117
we hear from users who stay motivated
by closing their Activity rings each day.

803
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,487
We also know there are many
iPhone users who want to meet

804
00:48:40,521 --> 00:48:43,590
their fitness goals
but don't yet have an Apple Watch.

805
00:48:43,624 --> 00:48:50,264
So in iOS 16, the Fitness app
will be available to all iPhone users.

806
00:48:50,297 --> 00:48:52,733
Using the iPhone motion sensors,

807
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:55,135
you can track steps, distance,

808
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:58,071
flights climbed,
and workouts from your favorite apps,

809
00:48:58,105 --> 00:49:01,775
which can be converted to
an estimation of your active calories

810
00:49:01,808 --> 00:49:04,478
to contribute to your daily Move goal.

811
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:07,181
You'll also be able to share
your Move ring with friends

812
00:49:07,214 --> 00:49:09,516
and receive coaching tips.

813
00:49:09,550 --> 00:49:13,120
While Apple Watch gives you a picture
of your all-day activity,

814
00:49:13,153 --> 00:49:17,057
we're excited to bring some of
the Fitness app benefits to iPhone users

815
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:19,693
to get them started
on their fitness journey.

816
00:49:19,726 --> 00:49:24,431
Now, I'll hand it off to Sumbul
to tell you what's coming in watchOS 9

817
00:49:24,464 --> 00:49:26,633
to help keep you healthy.

818
00:49:31,738 --> 00:49:33,774
Sumbul Ahmad Desai:
The Sleep app has helped millions of you

819
00:49:33,807 --> 00:49:36,777
by providing insights
into how much sleep you're getting

820
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,946
along with metrics like heart rate,

821
00:49:38,979 --> 00:49:41,348
respiratory rate, and blood oxygen.

822
00:49:41,381 --> 00:49:47,087
In watchOS 9, you'll be able to learn more
about your sleep with Sleep Stages.

823
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:50,891
Apple Watch uses signals from
the accelerometer and heart rate sensor

824
00:49:50,924 --> 00:49:53,894
to detect which stage of sleep you're in.

825
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:56,763
Machine learning models
were trained and validated

826
00:49:56,797 --> 00:50:01,001
against the clinical gold standard
of polysomnography with the largest

827
00:50:01,034 --> 00:50:04,571
and most diverse population
ever studied for a wearable.

828
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:07,307
You can see how much time
you spent in each stage,

829
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:09,643
as well as when you might have woken up.

830
00:50:09,676 --> 00:50:12,946
You'll see more details in the Health app
where you'll learn

831
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:16,083
that each sleep stage–
REM, Core, and Deep–

832
00:50:16,116 --> 00:50:18,485
perform an essential function.

833
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:22,756
And as you sleep, you're likely to cycle
through these stages multiple times.

834
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:26,627
Researchers are still looking
into what happens during sleep

835
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,562
and how it impacts your health.

836
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:31,632
We want to help push forward
the science of sleep,

837
00:50:31,665 --> 00:50:36,136
so Apple Heart and Movement Study
participants will now be able

838
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:39,573
to contribute sleep stage data
through the Research app.

839
00:50:39,606 --> 00:50:44,745
With the large scale of this study, we are
excited about the potential discoveries.

840
00:50:44,778 --> 00:50:47,347
That's what's new with sleep.

841
00:50:47,381 --> 00:50:51,652
Another area where Apple Watch
has an impact is heart health.

842
00:50:51,685 --> 00:50:55,956
We hear from so many of you who have
received an Atrial Fibrillation alert

843
00:50:55,989 --> 00:50:58,625
and sought potentially-life saving care.

844
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:03,430
So we also wanted to offer support
once you've been diagnosed.

845
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:06,133
When living with this condition,
it's important to understand

846
00:51:06,166 --> 00:51:08,969
the time you spend in AFib
because it may relate

847
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:11,772
to your risk of serious complications,
such as stroke.

848
00:51:11,805 --> 00:51:14,942
watchOS 9 can now track the amount of time

849
00:51:14,975 --> 00:51:19,479
your heart shows signs of this rhythm
with AFib History.

850
00:51:19,513 --> 00:51:21,949
And in the Health app,
you can manage lifestyle factors

851
00:51:21,982 --> 00:51:25,052
that may influence the amount of time
you spend in AFib

852
00:51:25,085 --> 00:51:28,222
like exercise, sleep, and weight.

853
00:51:28,255 --> 00:51:32,326
AFib History even helps you identify
the time of the day or week

854
00:51:32,359 --> 00:51:35,128
when your AFib is most frequent.

855
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:40,100
You can also share a PDF with your doctor
to facilitate richer conversations.

856
00:51:40,133 --> 00:51:43,036
AFib History
is a first-of-its-kind feature

857
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:47,574
that uniquely provides insights
into your AFib over the long term.

858
00:51:47,608 --> 00:51:52,546
We expect to receive FDA clearance
for AFib History soon.

859
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:55,148
Apple Watch makes some
of the more complicated aspects

860
00:51:55,182 --> 00:51:57,050
of your health more intuitive.

861
00:51:57,084 --> 00:52:00,454
And this year, we're tackling
another integral aspect of health

862
00:52:00,487 --> 00:52:04,458
for so many of us–Medications.

863
00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,895
Over 50% of people
take prescription medications,

864
00:52:07,928 --> 00:52:11,064
and we wanted to help make it
easier to track, manage,

865
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:13,967
and understand
the medications that you take.

866
00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:18,672
So in watchOS 9, the Medications app
makes it easy for you to discreetly

867
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:21,508
and conveniently track your medications,

868
00:52:21,542 --> 00:52:23,977
vitamins, and supplements anytime.

869
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:27,814
You can log medications
that you might take occasionally

870
00:52:27,848 --> 00:52:30,050
like Cetirizine for allergies.

871
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,986
And you can receive notifications
for medications

872
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,088
that you need to take regularly.

873
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:39,493
Rich complications on your watch face
can help you stay on top of your schedule.

874
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:44,198
And of course you can track and manage
your medications in the Health app,

875
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:47,067
even if you don't have an Apple Watch.

876
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,969
To build your medications list,

877
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:52,673
start typing the name,
and you'll see suggestions.

878
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:54,975
We wanted to make
creating the list easier,

879
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:58,312
especially if you take
multiple medications.

880
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:03,550
So you can just use your iPhone camera
to scan the label of your medication.

881
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:05,986
You can create a schedule
to receive reminders

882
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:10,390
and add custom visuals
to make it easier to remember.

883
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:14,027
Another important aspect of medications
is drug-drug interactions,

884
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:16,997
which can make them less effective
or cause side effects.

885
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,801
In the U.S. alone,
drug interactions cause nearly

886
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:24,638
a quarter of a million
hospitalizations each year.

887
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:28,442
To help you with this, you'll receive
an alert when you add a new medication

888
00:53:28,475 --> 00:53:30,611
if there is a critical interaction.

889
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:33,914
We've partnered with Elsevier,
a leading medical publisher,

890
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:37,317
to provide clinically accurate
and evidence-based information

891
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:40,254
across the Medications experience.

892
00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:44,124
You'll be able to review critical,
serious, and moderate interactions

893
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:47,060
as well as interaction factors
like alcohol.

894
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:49,496
Medications also works
with Health Sharing,

895
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,065
which is updated in iOS 16.

896
00:53:52,099 --> 00:53:54,801
You can now send a family member
an invitation

897
00:53:54,835 --> 00:53:56,803
to share their health data with you.

898
00:53:56,837 --> 00:54:00,774
This is another way that you can support
a loved one on their health journey

899
00:54:00,807 --> 00:54:03,277
and have peace of mind, too.

900
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:05,179
Now back to Kevin.

901
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:11,151
Kevin: Your health data is some of
your most personal information,

902
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:15,556
and privacy is central to how we build
and design features for Apple Watch.

903
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,658
Health data is encrypted on device

904
00:54:17,691 --> 00:54:20,494
and is not shared without
your explicit permission.

905
00:54:20,527 --> 00:54:24,164
You'll also now be periodically reminded
of what health data you're sharing

906
00:54:24,198 --> 00:54:25,832
and who you're sharing it with.

907
00:54:25,866 --> 00:54:28,402
There's so much more in watchOS 9,

908
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:31,538
including support for six
new keyboard languages,

909
00:54:31,572 --> 00:54:35,576
a new way for developers to connect
their watchOS apps to Apple TV,

910
00:54:35,609 --> 00:54:38,779
and with Family Setup,
kids can now control home devices

911
00:54:38,812 --> 00:54:40,747
right from their wrist.

912
00:54:40,781 --> 00:54:44,484
watchOS is the world's most advanced
wearable operating system,

913
00:54:44,518 --> 00:54:46,653
and watchOS 9 takes it further

914
00:54:46,687 --> 00:54:49,289
with new features
to help you stay connected,

915
00:54:49,323 --> 00:54:50,991
active, and healthy.

916
00:54:51,024 --> 00:54:52,492
Back to Craig.

917
00:54:52,526 --> 00:54:54,928
Craig: I'm so excited for watchOS 9

918
00:54:54,962 --> 00:54:57,831
and can't wait to get it
into the hands of our users.

919
00:54:57,865 --> 00:55:02,536
Next, to show you what's new with Mac,
here's John.

920
00:55:02,569 --> 00:55:10,577
♪ ♪

921
00:55:14,548 --> 00:55:16,350
John Ternus: We couldn't be more excited

922
00:55:16,383 --> 00:55:19,586
by how well the Mac transition
to Apple Silicon is going.

923
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:23,056
It all started with the launch of M1,
which brought a whole new level

924
00:55:23,090 --> 00:55:26,994
of performance, capabilities,
and battery life to the Mac.

925
00:55:27,027 --> 00:55:30,364
We've already transitioned
nearly the entire Mac product line.

926
00:55:30,397 --> 00:55:33,667
Users have been blown away
by the phenomenal capabilities

927
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:37,471
of these new systems
powered by the M1 family of chips.

928
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:40,407
And the Mac business
has never been stronger.

929
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:44,278
Well, today we're excited to start
the next generation

930
00:55:44,311 --> 00:55:46,280
of Apple Silicon for the Mac.

931
00:55:46,313 --> 00:55:47,948
Introducing...

932
00:55:48,849 --> 00:55:50,784
M2.

933
00:55:50,817 --> 00:55:55,455
It takes the breakthrough performance
and capabilities of M1 even further.

934
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:58,258
To tell you more,
I'll pass it over to Johny.

935
00:56:01,662 --> 00:56:04,398
Johny Srouji: Today we begin our second
generation of Apple Silicon

936
00:56:04,431 --> 00:56:06,200
designed specifically for the Mac.

937
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:10,938
The M-Series chips deliver a scalable
range of performance and capabilities.

938
00:56:10,971 --> 00:56:14,007
It began with M1's
breakthrough set of features

939
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,977
that transformed our most popular systems.

940
00:56:17,010 --> 00:56:19,947
M2 starts the second generation
of M-Series chips,

941
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,783
and goes beyond the remarkable features
of M1.

942
00:56:22,816 --> 00:56:26,587
Unlike others in the industry
who significantly increase power

943
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,757
to gain performance,
our approach is different.

944
00:56:30,791 --> 00:56:35,262
We continue to have a relentless focus
on power efficient performance.

945
00:56:35,295 --> 00:56:40,367
In other words, maximizing performance
while minimizing power consumption.

946
00:56:41,835 --> 00:56:45,939
Combined with our unified memory
architecture and custom technologies,

947
00:56:45,973 --> 00:56:50,577
this focus on power efficiency
allows M2 to bring even more performance

948
00:56:50,611 --> 00:56:54,615
and new capabilities
to our most popular Macs.

949
00:56:54,648 --> 00:56:56,316
M2 is built using an enhanced,

950
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,785
second-generation
five nanometer technology,

951
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:01,455
and features over 20 billion transistors:

952
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:04,191
that's 25% more than M1.

953
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:07,828
We use those transistors to enhance
every feature of the chip,

954
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:09,696
starting with the memory controller

955
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:14,001
which delivers
100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth,

956
00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:18,372
which is 50% more than M1
for even greater performance.

957
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:23,343
And because M1 is so capable,
users run all sorts of demanding tasks.

958
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:28,148
So for M2, we've enabled
up to 24GB of unified memory

959
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:31,552
to handle even larger
and more complex workloads.

960
00:57:31,585 --> 00:57:34,254
M2 features our next-generation CPU,

961
00:57:34,288 --> 00:57:38,258
with advancements in both
the performance and efficiency cores.

962
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:41,662
The performance cores are faster
and feature a larger cache,

963
00:57:41,695 --> 00:57:45,098
and the efficiency cores
have been significantly enhanced

964
00:57:45,132 --> 00:57:47,267
for even greater performance gains.

965
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:52,439
Together, they rip through CPU-intensive
tasks using very little power.

966
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:56,476
When we look at the multi-core
CPU performance of M2 compared to M1,

967
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,980
it delivers 18% greater performance.

968
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:02,883
And compared to the latest
10-core PC laptop chip,

969
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:06,820
the CPU in M2 delivers nearly
two times faster performance

970
00:58:06,854 --> 00:58:08,755
at the same power level.

971
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:11,892
And M2 delivers the peak performance
of the PC chip

972
00:58:11,925 --> 00:58:15,062
while using a quarter of the power.

973
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:18,298
Now let's compare M2 to the latest 12-core
PC laptop chip,

974
00:58:18,332 --> 00:58:20,334
which needs dramatically more power

975
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:22,135
to deliver an increase in performance.

976
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,772
So it's in a thicker, hotter,
more noisy system

977
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,140
with less battery life.

978
00:58:27,174 --> 00:58:31,845
M2 delivers nearly 90% of the peak
performance of the 12-core chip

979
00:58:31,879 --> 00:58:34,414
while using just a quarter of the power.

980
00:58:34,448 --> 00:58:37,184
This is what we mean
by the power efficient performance

981
00:58:37,217 --> 00:58:38,385
of Apple Silicon.

982
00:58:38,418 --> 00:58:41,321
M2 also features our next generation GPU,

983
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:45,225
which now has up to 10 cores–
that's two more than M1.

984
00:58:45,259 --> 00:58:48,295
Combined with a larger cache
and higher memory bandwidth,

985
00:58:48,328 --> 00:58:51,965
the 10-core GPU delivers a big boost
in graphics performance.

986
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:55,903
M2 delivers up to 25% higher
graphics performance

987
00:58:55,936 --> 00:58:58,205
at the same power level as M1

988
00:58:58,238 --> 00:59:02,509
and up to 35% higher performance
at its max.

989
00:59:02,543 --> 00:59:05,913
And compared to the integrated graphics
in the latest PC laptop chip,

990
00:59:05,946 --> 00:59:11,785
the GPU in M2 delivers 2.3 times faster
performance at the same power level.

991
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:14,655
And M2 delivers the peak performance
of the PC chip

992
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:17,157
using just one-fifth of the power.

993
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:19,793
This much higher performance
per watt from M2

994
00:59:19,826 --> 00:59:24,998
enables systems to run cool and quiet
with exceptional battery life.

995
00:59:25,032 --> 00:59:28,035
Now, one of the advantages
of making our own silicon

996
00:59:28,068 --> 00:59:31,271
is that we can quickly bring
our newest custom technologies

997
00:59:31,305 --> 00:59:32,940
across our SoCs.

998
00:59:32,973 --> 00:59:38,212
So M2 also features our next-generation
Secure Enclave and Neural Engine.

999
00:59:38,245 --> 00:59:43,383
The Neural Engine in M2 can process
up to 15.8 trillion operations per second.

1000
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:45,986
That's over 40% more than M1.

1001
00:59:46,019 --> 00:59:48,722
It also has
our next generation media engine,

1002
00:59:48,755 --> 00:59:51,391
including a higher-bandwidth video decoder

1003
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:55,863
that supports 8K H.264 and HEVC video.

1004
00:59:55,896 --> 00:59:59,366
And M2 features our powerful
ProRes video engine

1005
00:59:59,399 --> 01:00:01,835
for hardware accelerated
encode and decode.

1006
01:00:01,869 --> 01:00:07,674
So systems with M2 will be able to play
back multiple streams of 4K and 8K video.

1007
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,209
So that's M2.

1008
01:00:09,243 --> 01:00:14,548
It starts our next generation
of M-Series chips, with an 18% faster CPU,

1009
01:00:14,581 --> 01:00:17,150
35% faster GPU,

1010
01:00:17,184 --> 01:00:19,453
40% faster Neural Engine,

1011
01:00:19,486 --> 01:00:21,989
and 50% more memory bandwidth.

1012
01:00:22,022 --> 01:00:24,858
It takes the amazing performance,
capabilities,

1013
01:00:24,892 --> 01:00:27,861
and efficiency of M1 even further.

1014
01:00:27,895 --> 01:00:30,364
Now, back to John.

1015
01:00:31,365 --> 01:00:34,868
John: The fact that we're already starting
our next generation of Apple Silicon

1016
01:00:34,902 --> 01:00:37,037
for the Mac is remarkable.

1017
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:41,441
So now let's talk about
the first Mac to get the M2 chip.

1018
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:44,711
We're thrilled that it's
our most loved Mac–

1019
01:00:44,745 --> 01:00:45,913
the MacBook Air.

1020
01:00:45,946 --> 01:00:48,549
Users love MacBook Air
for its great performance,

1021
01:00:48,582 --> 01:00:50,584
portability, and battery life.

1022
01:00:50,617 --> 01:00:53,720
It defined the category
of thin and light notebooks.

1023
01:00:53,754 --> 01:00:57,624
And with M1, it redefined
what a thin and light notebook could do.

1024
01:00:57,658 --> 01:00:59,893
Today, it's more popular than ever.

1025
01:00:59,927 --> 01:01:04,698
In fact, MacBook Air is
the world's best-selling laptop.

1026
01:01:04,731 --> 01:01:09,136
Apple Silicon enables us to design
products we never could have imagined,

1027
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:13,006
which is why we're so excited
to introduce an all-new MacBook Air,

1028
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,709
completely redesigned around M2.

1029
01:01:15,742 --> 01:01:16,977

1035
01:02:06,793 --> 01:02:09,530
And to tell you all about it,
here's Kristin.

1036
01:02:11,565 --> 01:02:15,369
Kristin White: The new MacBook Air takes
everything our users love about the Air

1037
01:02:15,402 --> 01:02:17,104
to the next level.

1038
01:02:17,137 --> 01:02:20,841
The wedge shape of the previous Air
has evolved into a new design

1039
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:24,044
that's strikingly thin from every angle.

1040
01:02:24,077 --> 01:02:27,080
The durable,
all-aluminum unibody enclosure

1041
01:02:27,114 --> 01:02:30,784
feels incredibly solid when you hold it
and is built to last.

1042
01:02:30,817 --> 01:02:35,422
And this remarkably thin design
integrates its components so efficiently

1043
01:02:35,455 --> 01:02:40,727
that it results in an astonishing 20%
reduction in volume over the previous Air.

1044
01:02:40,761 --> 01:02:44,364
The new Air is just 11.3mm thin,

1045
01:02:44,398 --> 01:02:48,535
or under half an inch,
and it's only 2.7 pounds.

1046
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:52,072
MacBook Air now comes in four finishes:

1047
01:02:52,105 --> 01:02:53,841
Silver, Space Gray,

1048
01:02:53,874 --> 01:02:57,678
a gorgeous Starlight,
and a stunning Midnight.

1049
01:02:57,711 --> 01:03:01,982
And yes, MagSafe is back
for dedicated charging

1050
01:03:02,015 --> 01:03:03,951
and peace of mind when you're plugged in.

1051
01:03:03,984 --> 01:03:06,587
And it keeps
the two Thunderbolt ports free

1052
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:09,723
for connecting
to a variety of accessories.

1053
01:03:09,756 --> 01:03:14,061
There's also an audio jack with support
for high-impedance headphones.

1054
01:03:14,094 --> 01:03:17,130
This all-new design
is incredibly portable,

1055
01:03:17,164 --> 01:03:20,000
and it's loaded with new features,

1056
01:03:20,033 --> 01:03:23,804
starting with a brilliant
Liquid Retina display.

1057
01:03:23,837 --> 01:03:27,574
We expanded the display closer
to the sides and up around the camera

1058
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:29,843
to make room for the menu bar.

1059
01:03:29,877 --> 01:03:35,616
The result is a larger 13.6-inch display
with much thinner borders,

1060
01:03:35,649 --> 01:03:40,988
giving users more screen real estate
to view their content in brilliant detail.

1061
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:46,093
At 500 nits,
it's also 25% brighter than before.

1062
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:49,863
And MacBook Air now supports
1 billion colors,

1063
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:53,200
so photos and movies
look incredibly vibrant.

1064
01:03:53,233 --> 01:03:56,503
Next, let's talk about the camera.

1065
01:03:56,537 --> 01:04:00,174
Having a great camera is more
important than ever these days.

1066
01:04:00,207 --> 01:04:05,212
So MacBook Air features a new
1080p camera with twice the resolution

1067
01:04:05,245 --> 01:04:08,615
and twice the low-light performance
of the previous Air.

1068
01:04:08,649 --> 01:04:13,320
Combined with the processing power
of M2's advanced image signal processor,

1069
01:04:13,353 --> 01:04:16,423
you'll look great on video calls.

1070
01:04:16,456 --> 01:04:18,192
Next up, audio.

1071
01:04:18,225 --> 01:04:22,496
To fit inside such a thin design,
the speakers and mics

1072
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:25,933
are completely integrated
between the keyboard and display,

1073
01:04:25,966 --> 01:04:29,536
all while delivering
an even better audio experience.

1074
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:34,708
A three-mic array captures clean audio
using advanced beam-forming algorithms.

1075
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:37,044
And there's a four-speaker sound system

1076
01:04:37,077 --> 01:04:41,448
that produces amazing stereo separation
and vocal clarity.

1077
01:04:41,481 --> 01:04:44,785
There's also support
for immersive Spatial Audio

1078
01:04:44,818 --> 01:04:48,255
for music and movies with Dolby Atmos.

1079
01:04:48,288 --> 01:04:53,493
The Magic Keyboard features
a full-height function row with Touch ID.

1080
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:56,263
And, of course,
the new Air has a spacious,

1081
01:04:56,296 --> 01:04:59,700
industry-leading Force Touch trackpad.

1082
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:03,303
And when it comes to performance,
M2 takes it even further.

1083
01:05:03,337 --> 01:05:06,807
So applying filters and effects
in apps like Photoshop

1084
01:05:06,840 --> 01:05:09,343
is up to 20% faster than before

1085
01:05:09,376 --> 01:05:11,979
and a massive five times faster

1086
01:05:12,012 --> 01:05:14,948
for customers that haven't yet upgraded
to Apple Silicon.

1087
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:19,620
And for intensive workloads like editing
complex timelines in Final Cut Pro,

1088
01:05:19,653 --> 01:05:24,525
performance is nearly 40% faster
than the previous Air.

1089
01:05:24,558 --> 01:05:27,261
Thanks to the power efficiency of M2,

1090
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:32,666
all these capabilities are built into
a silent, fan-less design.

1091
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:36,303
And even with a larger display
and increased performance,

1092
01:05:36,336 --> 01:05:40,174
the Air delivers the same great
all-day battery life

1093
01:05:40,207 --> 01:05:43,644
with up to 18 hours of video playback.

1094
01:05:43,677 --> 01:05:46,180
There's also some new charging options,

1095
01:05:46,213 --> 01:05:50,350
including a compact power adapter
with two USB-C ports

1096
01:05:50,384 --> 01:05:52,586
so you can charge two devices at once.

1097
01:05:52,619 --> 01:05:54,555
And for the first time,

1098
01:05:54,588 --> 01:05:59,826
the Air supports fast charge
with an available 67W adapter.

1099
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,830
So you can charge
up to 50% in just 30 minutes.

1100
01:06:03,864 --> 01:06:08,936
So that's the all-new, amazingly portable
and powerful MacBook Air.

1101
01:06:08,969 --> 01:06:11,405
It's thinner, lighter, and faster

1102
01:06:11,438 --> 01:06:14,575
with a durable unibody design,
bigger display,

1103
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:19,012
better camera, all-day battery life,
and four beautiful finishes.

1104
01:06:19,046 --> 01:06:22,716
It's everything you could want
in a new MacBook Air.

1105
01:06:22,749 --> 01:06:26,453

to bring M2 to MacBook Air,

1112
01:07:41,995 --> 01:07:43,764
the world's best-selling laptop.

1113
01:07:43,797 --> 01:07:47,367
Only with Apple Silicon can you build
such a thin and light notebook

1114
01:07:47,401 --> 01:07:49,002
with a fan-less design

1115
01:07:49,036 --> 01:07:52,239
and this combination
of performance and capabilities.

1116
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:54,374
But that's not all we have for you today.

1117
01:07:54,408 --> 01:07:56,376
M2 is coming to another Mac,

1118
01:07:56,410 --> 01:08:00,047
which is actually the world's
second-best-selling laptop:

1119
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,982
the 13-inch MacBook Pro.

1120
01:08:02,015 --> 01:08:04,184
It's our most portable pro notebook,

1121
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:08,388
and users love the performance it delivers
in its compact design.

1122
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:11,191
Now with M2,
you get even more capabilities

1123
01:08:11,225 --> 01:08:13,427
in the same great form factor.

1124
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:16,897
With a faster 8-core CPU
and 10-core GPU,

1125
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:19,833
working with RAW images
in apps like Affinity Photo

1126
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:23,103
is nearly 40% faster
than the previous generation.

1127
01:08:23,136 --> 01:08:25,072
And over three times faster

1128
01:08:25,105 --> 01:08:27,741
if you're upgrading from a model
without Apple Silicon.

1129
01:08:27,774 --> 01:08:30,978
And playing graphics intensive games
like Baldur's Gate III

1130
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:35,382
is also nearly 40% faster
than the previous 13-inch Pro.

1131
01:08:35,415 --> 01:08:38,418
With an active cooling system,
the MacBook Pro is designed

1132
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:40,821
to sustain its pro performance.

1133
01:08:40,854 --> 01:08:46,527
And thanks to M2, it also supports
up to 24GB of unified memory.

1134
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,862
Along with 50% more memory bandwidth,

1135
01:08:48,896 --> 01:08:52,566
multitasking and working with
large assets is super fluid.

1136
01:08:52,599 --> 01:08:56,870
With support for ProRes encode
and decode in M2's media engine,

1137
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:59,173
you can convert
your video projects to ProRes

1138
01:08:59,206 --> 01:09:01,975
nearly three times faster than before.

1139
01:09:02,009 --> 01:09:04,678
MacBook Pro also delivers
phenomenal battery life,

1140
01:09:04,711 --> 01:09:07,681
with up to 20 hours of video playback.

1141
01:09:07,714 --> 01:09:11,018
So that's
the powerful 13-inch MacBook Pro.

1142
01:09:11,051 --> 01:09:14,655
With the incredible performance of M2,
ProRes acceleration,

1143
01:09:14,688 --> 01:09:18,492
up to 24GB of memory,
and up to 20 hours of battery life,

1144
01:09:18,525 --> 01:09:22,196
our most portable Pro notebook
gets even better.

1145
01:09:22,229 --> 01:09:25,966
Both the Air and the Pro also support
our environmental goals.

1146
01:09:25,999 --> 01:09:30,204
They use 100% recycled rare earth elements
in many components,

1147
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:32,739
are free of numerous harmful substances,

1148
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:35,709
and meet Apple's high standards
for energy efficiency.

1149
01:09:35,742 --> 01:09:39,279
The all-new MacBook Air starts
at $1199

1150
01:09:39,313 --> 01:09:41,982
and just $1099 for education.

1151
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:45,619
The powerful 13-inch MacBook Pro
starts at $1299

1152
01:09:45,652 --> 01:09:47,888
and $1199 for education.

1153
01:09:47,921 --> 01:09:50,290
And they'll be available next month.

1154
01:09:50,324 --> 01:09:53,994
And the MacBook Air with M1
stays in the lineup at $999

1155
01:09:54,027 --> 01:09:56,430
and just $899 for education.

1156
01:09:56,463 --> 01:10:00,834
We're thrilled to bring M2
to the world's two most popular laptops,

1157
01:10:00,868 --> 01:10:03,637
the MacBook Air
and 13-inch MacBook Pro.

1158
01:10:03,670 --> 01:10:07,808
And they join the even more powerful
14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro

1159
01:10:07,841 --> 01:10:09,543
with M1 Pro and M1 Max

1160
01:10:09,576 --> 01:10:13,180
to round out the most amazing lineup
of Macs we've ever offered,

1161
01:10:13,213 --> 01:10:17,484
and continue our tremendous pace
of innovation for the Mac.

1162
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:20,153
Now, back to Craig.

1163
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:22,489
Craig: We're really excited
about these new Macs

1164
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:25,225
with the next generation of Apple Silicon.

1165
01:10:25,259 --> 01:10:29,162
And the powerful software
that drives the experience is macOS.

1166
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:33,700
So let's talk about what's new.

1167
01:10:34,835 --> 01:10:36,803
Kyle: Jump! Sit!

1168
01:10:36,837 --> 01:10:38,138
Craig?

1169
01:10:38,172 --> 01:10:39,606
Craig: Sorry, Kyle. Wrong door.

1170
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:43,777
♪ ♪

1171
01:10:43,810 --> 01:10:47,080
macOS plays a critical role
in our lives

1172
01:10:47,114 --> 01:10:51,451
as we work, collaborate with colleagues,
family, and friends,

1173
01:10:51,485 --> 01:10:53,820
create and organize
what's important to us,

1174
01:10:53,854 --> 01:10:55,756
and so much more.

1175
01:10:55,789 --> 01:11:01,495
This year, we focused on making the
core things you do with macOS even better,

1176
01:11:01,528 --> 01:11:04,898
delivering new ways to be productive
and take advantage

1177
01:11:04,932 --> 01:11:08,969
of the capability of your
other devices with Continuity.

1178
01:11:09,002 --> 01:11:10,737
So what should we call it?

1179
01:11:10,771 --> 01:11:13,874
Well, that brings us
to the latest exploits

1180
01:11:13,907 --> 01:11:16,710
of Apple's crack product marketing team.

1181
01:11:16,743 --> 01:11:22,749
They've been absolutely riding high
since their naming coup on M1 and M2,

1182
01:11:22,783 --> 01:11:25,853
and needless to say, they were exhausted.

1183
01:11:25,886 --> 01:11:29,723
But after their requisite three-month
rejuvenation retreat in Monterey,

1184
01:11:29,756 --> 01:11:32,292
with their chakras now
in complete alignment,

1185
01:11:32,326 --> 01:11:35,863
the team once again piled
into their macOS naming microbus

1186
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:39,032
and wove their way down Highway 1.

1187
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:42,936
Chasing the vibrant display
of colorful California wildflowers,

1188
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,738
they finally came to rest

1189
01:11:44,771 --> 01:11:48,442
where stunning surf meets lush
alluvial plains,

1190
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:50,944
in beautiful Ventura.

1191
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:55,048
macOS Ventura enriches so many
of the ways we use our Macs.

1192
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:56,717
So let's jump in.

1193
01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:01,855
A key part of the Mac experience
is helping you be productive and creative,

1194
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:05,759
which can often mean having
a lot of windows open at once.

1195
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:09,429
And the more you do,
the more overwhelming this can become.

1196
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:11,632
We all want the perfect mix–

1197
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:14,301
to focus on our work without distractions

1198
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:17,204
and to easily move between tasks.

1199
01:12:17,237 --> 01:12:22,042
This year, we have a new way
to automatically keep everything organized

1200
01:12:22,075 --> 01:12:25,112
and give you quick access to your windows.

1201
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:27,848
It's called Stage Manager.

1202
01:12:27,881 --> 01:12:29,483
Let's see how it works.

1203
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:33,053
When you're working on the Mac,
it's really easy

1204
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:36,089
to find yourself
with lots of open windows.

1205
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:39,726
Now, the Mac has great tools
like Mission Control

1206
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,362
to help you find the window
that you're looking for,

1207
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,097
but with so many open windows,

1208
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:47,334
it can feel like you never really escape
all the clutter.

1209
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:51,138
With Stage Manager,
you can focus on the app you're using

1210
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:53,207
without the distractions,

1211
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,309
and it's easy to get started.

1212
01:12:55,342 --> 01:12:59,813
Let's activate Stage Manager
from Control Center.

1213
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:04,618
As you see, it automatically arranges
all my windows for me off to the side

1214
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:08,889
and puts the app I'm currently
working with front and center.

1215
01:13:08,922 --> 01:13:10,624
When I bring forward a different app,

1216
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:13,594
like clicking on Mail here in the Dock,

1217
01:13:13,627 --> 01:13:15,629
you'll see that it's brought to the stage

1218
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:18,365
and Safari gracefully moves
over to the left

1219
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,267
with my other recent apps.

1220
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,237
When I click on Safari,
it retakes the stage,

1221
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,205
and Mail moves back to the left.

1222
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:28,842
You'll notice that for an app
with multiple open windows,

1223
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:32,713
like Pages here, Stage Manager gathers
all the windows together

1224
01:13:32,746 --> 01:13:34,381
in a single pile.

1225
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:36,750
When I click, I get the top one,

1226
01:13:36,783 --> 01:13:39,987
and if I want a different window,
I can cycle through them

1227
01:13:40,020 --> 01:13:41,555
just by clicking.

1228
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,457
It's really convenient.

1229
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:46,360
Of course,
just as you would expect on a Mac,

1230
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:50,964
I can have overlapping windows and
multiple apps open at the same time too.

1231
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:53,400
It's really easy to group apps together.

1232
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:59,506
Here I'll just drag in Notes
and pair it with my Pages window.

1233
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,142
This is so great
when I'm working on projects

1234
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:03,977
that involve a specific group of windows

1235
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:07,381
like planning a trip
with these three apps here.

1236
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:09,850
And if I go back to my previous group,

1237
01:14:09,883 --> 01:14:12,553
Stage Manager keeps my windows arranged

1238
01:14:12,586 --> 01:14:14,454
just as I left them.

1239
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:16,089
I love working this way.

1240
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:18,192
Of course, like many Mac users,

1241
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:21,295
I often want to get at files
on my desktop,

1242
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:25,165
and with Stage Manager,
we've made that easier than ever.

1243
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,167
I'm working on this Final Cut project,

1244
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,969
and I want to pull in a couple of files.

1245
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:33,273
With just a click on my desktop,
my windows clear the stage

1246
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,942
and my files are revealed.

1247
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:38,312
Now I can grab these title graphics

1248
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:42,449
and drag them over
to my Final Cut window.

1249
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:44,952
I'll just drop them in right here,

1250
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,720
and boom.

1251
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:51,992
So that's a quick look at multitasking
with Stage Manager,

1252
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:56,630
Another part of the Mac experience
that helps you do more is Spotlight.

1253
01:14:56,663 --> 01:15:00,167
This year we have a big update
that delivers a more consistent

1254
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,337
and powerful experience
across our platforms.

1255
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,406
Spotlight is great
for doing all kinds of things,

1256
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,476
like quickly launching an app
or starting a search.

1257
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:12,479
And now you can peek at a result
in Quick Look

1258
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,581
with a tap on the space bar.

1259
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:17,618
Spotlight can now also find images
from your photo library,

1260
01:15:17,651 --> 01:15:20,521
across the system, and on the web.

1261
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:24,791
And using Live Text,
you can search the text inside the image.

1262
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:28,028
You can also take actions
like starting a timer

1263
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:30,931
or running a shortcut
right from Spotlight.

1264
01:15:30,964 --> 01:15:33,667
It's also a great way to get information,

1265
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,671
now leveraging the full window
for richer results.

1266
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:42,242
For musicians, you'll see their albums,
key facts, news, and more.

1267
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:45,746
It's also great for movies, TV shows,
and actors,

1268
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:48,582
businesses, and sports.

1269
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:51,985
Rich results and the ability
to take actions right from Spotlight

1270
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:55,489
are also coming to iOS and iPadOS.

1271
01:15:55,522 --> 01:15:59,626
Now, speaking of iOS,
we wanted to make Spotlight even easier

1272
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:01,628
to discover and access,

1273
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:05,165
so we added it right
to the bottom of the Home Screen.

1274
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,502
With just a tap, you can use Spotlight
to launch an app,

1275
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:11,338
find a contact, or start a search.

1276
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:14,441
These updates
make Spotlight more productive,

1277
01:16:14,474 --> 01:16:17,444
helping you find
what you're looking for faster.

1278
01:16:17,477 --> 01:16:22,816
Next, let's turn to an app that many of us
use to communicate every day.

1279
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:25,519
To take you through it,
here's Darin.

1280
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:30,891
Darin Adler:
Of course, we're talking about Mail.

1281
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,961
Mail is central to how
so many of us communicate.

1282
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:37,164
This year, we have great updates
that will help you be more productive,

1283
01:16:37,197 --> 01:16:39,666
starting with some
highly-requested features.

1284
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:44,338
Undo send lets you pull an email back
a few moments after hitting Send.

1285
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:48,609
Scheduled send, so your emails arrive
at the perfect moment.

1286
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:51,912
Follow-up suggestions will automatically
remind you to follow up

1287
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:54,014
if you haven't received a response.

1288
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:57,117
And Remind Me makes it easy
to come back to a message

1289
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,019
at a particular date and time.

1290
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:01,588
Next, let's talk Search.

1291
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:05,492
This is the biggest overhaul
of Search in Mail we've done in years,

1292
01:17:05,526 --> 01:17:07,995
leveraging the latest
state-of-the-art techniques

1293
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:10,430
to deliver more accurate
and complete results.

1294
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:13,567
When you click Search,
you'll see recently shared documents,

1295
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:16,103
links, and more.

1296
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,471
The moment you start typing,

1297
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:20,974
with each letter,
you instantly see suggestions.

1298
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:23,744
If you make a typo,
Search is one step ahead,

1299
01:17:23,777 --> 01:17:26,380
only showing results
for the correct spelling.

1300
01:17:26,413 --> 01:17:29,683
And if Search knows a synonym,
it'll look for that too.

1301
01:17:29,716 --> 01:17:34,855
And all these new features are also coming
to iPadOS and iOS.

1302
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:36,823
And that's Mail.

1303
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:41,328
Next up is another app most of us spend
a ton of time in every day:

1304
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,729
Safari.

1305
01:17:42,763 --> 01:17:46,466
With macOS Ventura,
Safari is the world's fastest browser,

1306
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:50,704
rendering the most complex websites
with incredible speed.

1307
01:17:50,737 --> 01:17:53,574
Safari is the most power-efficient
browser on Mac,

1308
01:17:53,607 --> 01:17:56,510
letting you do more on a single charge
than any other browser.

1309
01:17:56,543 --> 01:18:01,148
And of course, Safari is a trailblazer
in protecting your privacy on the web,

1310
01:18:01,181 --> 01:18:03,450
with features like
Intelligent Tracking Protection

1311
01:18:03,483 --> 01:18:04,918
and Privacy Report.

1312
01:18:04,952 --> 01:18:08,655
Safari has a legacy of introducing
key web technologies

1313
01:18:08,689 --> 01:18:10,824
that elevate the web experience
for everyone.

1314
01:18:10,858 --> 01:18:15,262
Safari's pioneering support for HTML5
transformed the video experience

1315
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:19,733
on the web, resulting in higher-quality
playback and increased battery life.

1316
01:18:19,766 --> 01:18:23,003
And Safari continues to deliver support
for the latest web technologies

1317
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:24,671
and standards for web developers,

1318
01:18:24,705 --> 01:18:27,541
including all of these
added in just the last year,

1319
01:18:27,574 --> 01:18:30,978
like more fluid web animations,
new browser extension types,

1320
01:18:31,011 --> 01:18:34,515
and support for
the push notifications standards.

1321
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:38,919
These enable more immersive
and engaging web content for our users.

1322
01:18:38,952 --> 01:18:42,956
And now Safari has a new way to share
your favorite content with others

1323
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,592
with Shared Tab Groups.

1324
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:48,262
Whether you're planning a trip
with friends or shopping for a couch

1325
01:18:48,295 --> 01:18:52,099
with your partner,
you can share all the tabs in one place.

1326
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:55,869
And when they find something great,
they can add tabs too.

1327
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:59,072
You can see which tabs your friends
are looking at live,

1328
01:18:59,106 --> 01:19:02,476
and using built-in collaboration,
you can easily connect in real time

1329
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:04,311
over Messages or FaceTime.

1330
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:07,381
It's so easy to discover the web together.

1331
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:12,186
And next, we have a new way
to make the web a safer place.

1332
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:15,856
We rely on passwords
to protect our most private accounts.

1333
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:19,793
While Safari helps users create
the strongest passwords possible,

1334
01:19:19,826 --> 01:19:23,130
there are still ways
accounts can be compromised.

1335
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:26,567
Hackers can use social engineering
techniques like phishing

1336
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,570
to trick users into giving up passwords.

1337
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,772
They can also breach a website directly

1338
01:19:31,805 --> 01:19:35,642
to get access to all the passwords
stored on its server.

1339
01:19:35,676 --> 01:19:38,512
That's why we've helped create
a next generation credential

1340
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:41,348
that's more secure, easier to use,

1341
01:19:41,381 --> 01:19:44,318
and aims to replace passwords for good.

1342
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:48,422
We call them passkeys.

1343
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,558
Passkeys use powerful
cryptographic techniques

1344
01:19:51,592 --> 01:19:55,262
and the biometrics built into your device
to keep accounts safe.

1345
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,365
To create a passkey, just use TouchID

1346
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:01,502
or FaceID to authenticate,
and you're done.

1347
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,338
When users create a passkey,
a unique digital key is created

1348
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:06,740
that only works
for the site it was created for.

1349
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,775
Passkeys can't be phished.

1350
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:10,811
Since the passkey never leaves
your devices,

1351
01:20:10,844 --> 01:20:14,147
hackers can't trick you into sharing it
on a fake website.

1352
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:18,385
And passkeys can't be leaked because
nothing secret is kept on a web server.

1353
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:22,789
We've designed passkeys to work in apps
as easily as they do on the web.

1354
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:27,461
Passkeys are securely synced across
Apple devices using iCloud Keychain

1355
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:29,429
and are instantly available on Mac,

1356
01:20:29,463 --> 01:20:33,934
iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV.

1357
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,669
We've been working with industry leaders

1358
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:38,105
in the FIDO alliance
including Google and Microsoft,

1359
01:20:38,138 --> 01:20:42,142
to ensure that passkeys work seamlessly
cross-platform.

1360
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:45,412
With a passkey, you'll be able to walk up
to a non-Apple device

1361
01:20:45,445 --> 01:20:49,183
and sign in to a website or app
using just your iPhone.

1362
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:51,952
The transition away from passwords
will be a journey,

1363
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:55,722
and we look forward to working with
developers on the password-less future.

1364
01:20:55,756 --> 01:20:57,491
And that's Safari.

1365
01:20:57,524 --> 01:21:00,394
Now back over to you, Craig.

1366
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:02,796
Craig: We think these updates
to Mail and Safari

1367
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:05,132
will help you be productive
and browse the web

1368
01:21:05,165 --> 01:21:07,434
in new and safer ways.

1369
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:11,772
Next, let's have some fun
and talk about gaming.

1370
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:15,375
We're at a point where two things
are really coming together.

1371
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:19,213
First, Apple Silicon
has changed everything.

1372
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:23,650
It's taking the graphics performance
of every new Mac to new heights,

1373
01:21:23,684 --> 01:21:28,322
giving Macs the power to run
the most demanding games, with ease.

1374
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:31,625
Second,
the Mac is more popular than ever,

1375
01:21:31,658 --> 01:21:36,463
and it's a huge and fast-growing
opportunity for game developers.

1376
01:21:36,496 --> 01:21:41,335
And since we have a unified silicon
architecture spanning from iPhone and iPad

1377
01:21:41,368 --> 01:21:43,637
all the way up to M1 Ultra,

1378
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:47,841
game developers can scale the quality
and performance of their titles

1379
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,810
across the entire line.

1380
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:55,148
Another key part of a great gaming
experience is the software that powers it.

1381
01:21:55,182 --> 01:21:58,352
To tell you what's new, here's Jeremy.

1382
01:22:01,722 --> 01:22:03,724
Jeremy Sandmel:
We continue to improve Metal.

1383
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:06,326
It's the software that powers
hardware-accelerated graphics

1384
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,661
on all our platforms.

1385
01:22:07,694 --> 01:22:11,164
And now, Metal 3 brings
new features that will unleash

1386
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:14,701
the full potential of Apple Silicon
for years to come.

1387
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:18,238
Gaming at maximum resolution
and quality looks awesome.

1388
01:22:18,272 --> 01:22:21,508
And to help game developers
increase the performance of realistic

1389
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:26,013
and immersive graphics,
we're introducing MetalFX Upscaling,

1390
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:31,418
which enables developers to render rich,
visually complex scenes even faster.

1391
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:34,855
It works by rendering smaller,
less compute-intensive frames

1392
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:38,959
and then applies high-quality spatial
upscaling and temporal anti-aliasing.

1393
01:22:38,992 --> 01:22:40,327
And it's so cool.

1394
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,529
No Man's Sky,
coming to Mac later this year,

1395
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:46,166
will be one of the first games
to use MetalFX Upscaling.

1396
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,605
The frame rate increases, giving you that
responsive feel, and it looks beautiful.

1397
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,274
Another area we're improving
is game loading.

1398
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,978
Games continue to push the boundaries
and appear more realistic than ever before

1399
01:22:58,011 --> 01:23:00,814
by using richer textures
and more geometric detail,

1400
01:23:00,848 --> 01:23:02,649
which can take a while to load.

1401
01:23:02,683 --> 01:23:05,719
So Metal 3 adds a new fast
resource loading API

1402
01:23:05,752 --> 01:23:08,789
that minimizes wait time
by providing a more direct path

1403
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,158
from storage to the unified memory system

1404
01:23:11,191 --> 01:23:14,094
so the GPU can more quickly access
high-quality textures

1405
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:16,430
and buffers without waiting.

1406
01:23:16,463 --> 01:23:20,100
Metal 3 and Apple Silicon enable
even more immersive visuals,

1407
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,669
faster performance, and quicker loading.

1408
01:23:22,703 --> 01:23:25,939
This really is a new day
for gaming on the Mac.

1409
01:23:25,973 --> 01:23:27,441
But don't take our word for it.

1410
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:29,109
Let's hear from the team that has created

1411
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:31,478
the acclaimed Resident Evil Village.

1412
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:33,747
We are so excited it's coming to the Mac.

1413
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:37,117
To tell you more, we are delighted
to introduce Ijuin-san,

1414
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:41,021
manager of Capcom's
Advanced Technical Research Division.

1415
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:46,326
♪ ♪

1416
01:25:45,112 --> 01:25:47,481
Craig: Thank you, Ijuin-san.

1417
01:25:47,514 --> 01:25:50,784
Next, let's talk about Continuity.

1418
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:55,722
Continuity is all about giving you
a seamless experience across devices.

1419
01:25:55,756 --> 01:25:59,826
Features like Universal Control,
AirPlay, and Handoff

1420
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:03,363
allow you to always use
the right device for the moment.

1421
01:26:03,397 --> 01:26:07,634
And today,
we're extending Handoff to FaceTime.

1422
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:11,004
Now picture this: you answer
a FaceTime call on your iPhone

1423
01:26:11,038 --> 01:26:12,739
while you're away from your desk.

1424
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:15,876
When you get home and bring
your iPhone up close to your Mac,

1425
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:19,279
your Mac automatically recognizes
the call on your iPhone,

1426
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:22,015
and you can move it
to your Mac seamlessly,

1427
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:25,219
giving you a bigger view
to continue the conversation.

1428
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:28,155
You can handoff calls in any direction
between your devices,

1429
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:32,693
so you'll always be able to join the call
from the right one.

1430
01:26:32,726 --> 01:26:36,630
We also have exciting news
about another Continuity feature,

1431
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:41,602
which pairs the best camera you own
with the large displays on Mac.

1432
01:26:41,635 --> 01:26:45,105
We spend a lot of time in front
of our Macs with our cameras on.

1433
01:26:45,138 --> 01:26:49,943
Our webcams have become an integral part
of work, school, and play.

1434
01:26:49,977 --> 01:26:52,579
And now, with Continuity Camera,

1435
01:26:52,613 --> 01:26:55,449
you can use iPhone as your webcam.

1436
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:59,620
It's powered by the advanced capabilities
of the iPhone camera system,

1437
01:26:59,653 --> 01:27:03,690
letting you do things that were never
before possible with a webcam.

1438
01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:05,959
Let me show you how it works.

1439
01:27:05,993 --> 01:27:09,296
Now, I'm just gonna pop this stand
on my iPhone,

1440
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:12,199
and attach it to my display.

1441
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:14,168
Let's launch FaceTime.

1442
01:27:16,803 --> 01:27:19,673
You can see my Mac
automatically detects my iPhone

1443
01:27:19,706 --> 01:27:21,341
and uses it as the camera.

1444
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:23,310
I don't even have to wake up my iPhone.

1445
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:26,346
This all works wirelessly
so there's nothing to plug in.

1446
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:30,117
So to try this out, let's call a friend
in the design studio.

1447
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,688
Johnnie Manzari: Hi, Craig!

1448
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:35,589
Craig: Hey, Johnnie!

1449
01:27:35,622 --> 01:27:37,891
Are you up for helping me give a demo
of Continuity Camera?

1450
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:39,726
Johnnie: Sure, I'm using it right now.

1451
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,796
with my iPhone and Pro Display XDR.

1452
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:46,400
You know, one thing I love about
Continuity Camera is Center Stage.

1453
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:49,770
I can move around and Center Stage
will keep me in the frame.

1454
01:27:49,803 --> 01:27:52,706
I'll frequently pair that
with Portrait Mode

1455
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:55,042
to blur the background
with that beautiful boca.

1456
01:27:55,075 --> 01:27:57,578
Craig: Yeah, I've loved
having these features on my iPad,

1457
01:27:57,611 --> 01:28:00,347
and it's great that we can now
use them with any Mac.

1458
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,215
Johnnie: For sure.

1459
01:28:01,248 --> 01:28:03,650
A new one people are gonna love
is Studio Light.

1460
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:05,219
Check this out.

1461
01:28:05,252 --> 01:28:08,188
It brightens my face
and darkens the background.

1462
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:09,089
Craig: Hey, that looks great.

1463
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:10,891
It's almost like you have a ring-light.

1464
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:13,527
Johnnie: It is perfect
for tough lighting conditions,

1465
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,163
like if I'm ever sitting in front
of a window.

1466
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:21,835
Okay, now I wanna show
my favorite new feature, Desk View.

1467
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:23,871
You can see the work that's on my desk,

1468
01:28:23,904 --> 01:28:25,939
and it keeps me in the picture.

1469
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:28,008
It is amazing.

1470
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,943
Take a look.

1471
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,546
It looks like I have
a dedicated overhead camera,

1472
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:36,049
but this is Desk View
creating both of these views

1473
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,353
from the one ultra-wide camera
on my iPhone

1474
01:28:39,386 --> 01:28:42,723
using some very powerful image processing.

1475
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:45,459
I didn't even need to adjust my phone.

1476
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:48,762
Desk View's gonna be great
for sharing new designs with my team.

1477
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:52,966
I can even use it
to show my nephew a new card trick.

1478
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,768
Craig: This is gonna be so cool.

1479
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:58,105
Well, hey, Johnnie, thanks for helping us
give the quick demo.

1480
01:28:58,138 --> 01:28:59,773
Johnnie: No problem.
I'll talk to you later.

1481
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:04,111
Craig: In addition to FaceTime,
you can use Continuity Camera

1482
01:29:04,144 --> 01:29:06,380
with any macOS videoconferencing app

1483
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:09,883
like Zoom, Teams, Webex, and more.

1484
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:12,586
And we're working with Belkin
to offer beautiful stands

1485
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:15,522
to hold your iPhone
at the perfect height and angle.

1486
01:29:15,556 --> 01:29:17,858
These will be available later this year.

1487
01:29:17,891 --> 01:29:21,228
And since so many of you with a Mac
already have an iPhone,

1488
01:29:21,261 --> 01:29:25,632
these great capabilities come
with the devices you already own.

1489
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:27,868
That's the magic of Continuity.

1490
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:30,304
And that's macOS Ventura,

1491
01:29:30,337 --> 01:29:34,741
a feature-packed release that brings
new tools for managing windows,

1492
01:29:34,775 --> 01:29:38,212
smart new features for Mail, Safari,
and games,

1493
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:41,415
and magical new Continuity features.

1494
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:45,986
Now let's turn to iPadOS.

1495
01:29:46,019 --> 01:29:54,027
♪ ♪

1496
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,302
Our vision for iPadOS

1497
01:30:02,336 --> 01:30:04,838
is to create a distinct experience

1498
01:30:04,872 --> 01:30:07,207
that's built on the best of iOS,

1499
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:11,645
like security, mobility,
and an intuitive touch-first interface,

1500
01:30:11,678 --> 01:30:14,515
with powerful capabilities from macOS,

1501
01:30:14,548 --> 01:30:17,718
like multitasking and trackpad support,

1502
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:22,523
combined with features like Apple Pencil
that are uniquely iPad.

1503
01:30:22,556 --> 01:30:27,060
All of this comes together
to deliver our most versatile device.

1504
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:31,298
This year in iPadOS 16,
we have a big release

1505
01:30:31,331 --> 01:30:34,635
that's going to take this versatility
even further.

1506
01:30:34,668 --> 01:30:39,139
Starting with a host of features that
you heard about earlier in iOS and macOS

1507
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:41,875
that are going to be great on iPad,

1508
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:43,644
like Shared Photo Library,

1509
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:46,914
Shared Tab Groups
and Passkeys in Safari,

1510
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:49,483
and a big update to Mail.

1511
01:30:49,516 --> 01:30:51,752
We're also bringing Weather to iPad,

1512
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:55,556
taking full advantage of the stunning
display with beautiful animations

1513
01:30:55,589 --> 01:30:57,658
like these gently moving clouds,

1514
01:30:57,691 --> 01:31:00,594
heavy snowfall, and driving rain.

1515
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:05,265
And all of these modules are tappable
to access detailed information.

1516
01:31:05,299 --> 01:31:08,302
And for developers,
we're announcing WeatherKit

1517
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:11,438
so they can build weather into their apps.

1518
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:15,776
iPadOS 16 also includes new ways
to collaborate with others,

1519
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:19,479
more capable apps,
and new features for Pro users

1520
01:31:19,513 --> 01:31:22,883
that take advantage
of the power of the M1 chip.

1521
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:25,319
So let's start with collaboration,

1522
01:31:25,352 --> 01:31:27,354
which often begins in Messages

1523
01:31:27,387 --> 01:31:29,623
when you're asked
to pass along a document.

1524
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:31,425
Of course, you could send a copy,

1525
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:35,429
but now you can also instantly kick off
a collaboration

1526
01:31:35,462 --> 01:31:37,464
when you send something
with the Share Sheet.

1527
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:40,767
This makes initiating collaboration
across the system

1528
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,569
as easy as sending a link,

1529
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:47,374
and means a conversation with your
collaborators is always just a tap away.

1530
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:49,343
Let me show you how it works.

1531
01:31:50,944 --> 01:31:54,047
So let's tap in to Messages.

1532
01:31:54,081 --> 01:31:56,683
I've been talking to the team
about an upcoming offsite,

1533
01:31:56,717 --> 01:32:00,187
and we've been using this conversation
to figure out the details.

1534
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,390
Now, it looks like a message just came in
from Lopp,

1535
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:05,492
and he wants to catch up on the latest.

1536
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:09,162
Over here in Pages,
I've been collecting our ideas.

1537
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:11,031
I want to share this with the group.

1538
01:32:11,064 --> 01:32:13,433
In the past, when I'd tap Share,

1539
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:15,335
I'd end up sharing a copy.

1540
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:19,773
But now, you'll notice I can start
collaboration right here.

1541
01:32:19,806 --> 01:32:22,776
And what's great is, I don't need
to type in a bunch of names

1542
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:24,344
or email addresses.

1543
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:29,116
When I select a Messages group,
everyone gets added automatically.

1544
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:31,285
Let's go ahead and send it.

1545
01:32:33,587 --> 01:32:35,956
This makes it way easier
to collaborate with people

1546
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:37,524
you're already communicating with.

1547
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:40,827
Everyone can immediately join
and start making edits,

1548
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,663
like the ones you see here.

1549
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:44,831
And back in the Messages conversation,

1550
01:32:44,865 --> 01:32:48,268
I even get a notice of any changes
I might have missed.

1551
01:32:48,302 --> 01:32:51,205
When you collaborate this way,
your document is connected

1552
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,372
to the conversation.

1553
01:32:52,406 --> 01:32:54,374
The group appears in the toolbar,

1554
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:57,911
and I can kick off communication
right from here.

1555
01:32:57,945 --> 01:33:00,314
I can get back
to the messages conversation

1556
01:33:00,347 --> 01:33:02,316
or initiate a FaceTime call.

1557
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:06,486
Let's go ahead and call the group.

1558
01:33:08,288 --> 01:33:09,723
Hey, everyone!

1559
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:10,858
Michael Lopp: Hey, Craig.

1560
01:33:10,891 --> 01:33:13,861
Craig: Hey, I saw that a few of you
were in the document.

1561
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:16,697
Does anyone have any other ideas
for the offsite?

1562
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,766
Lopp: Yeah, I've been thinking about it,
and I've been collecting a few tabs.

1563
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,568
I'm gonna share them right now with you
in Safari.

1564
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:23,604
Craig: Thanks, Lopp.

1565
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:27,641
This year, you can start collaborating
with the group right in FaceTime.

1566
01:33:27,674 --> 01:33:31,979
You can see that Lopp just invited me
to collaborate on a set of tabs in Safari.

1567
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:35,415
I'm gonna go ahead and accept his invite,

1568
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:38,519
and now, I can get to them in Safari.

1569
01:33:38,552 --> 01:33:40,454
Just like with the Pages document,

1570
01:33:40,487 --> 01:33:43,957
everyone in the group
automatically has access.

1571
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:46,860
I can see Anne and Mindy
joining the tab group,

1572
01:33:46,894 --> 01:33:50,998
and I can even see which tabs people are
looking at right in the tab bar.

1573
01:33:51,031 --> 01:33:54,535
Looks like Mindy is checking out kayaking.

1574
01:33:54,568 --> 01:33:56,970
Lopp: Found a few more.
Check these out.

1575
01:33:57,004 --> 01:33:59,840
Craig: When Lopp adds tabs,
they instantly appear

1576
01:33:59,873 --> 01:34:02,543
so we can all check them out.

1577
01:34:02,576 --> 01:34:06,113
Let's see, we already did this last year,

1578
01:34:06,146 --> 01:34:08,749
but ziplining looks cool!

1579
01:34:08,782 --> 01:34:10,684
All right, team, let's wrap this up

1580
01:34:10,717 --> 01:34:13,921
and update our document
with the latest ideas.

1581
01:34:16,256 --> 01:34:18,292
Looks like Anne is updating the text,

1582
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:20,327
and Mindy just dropped in an image,

1583
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,763
so we're all set.

1584
01:34:22,796 --> 01:34:25,933
So that's a quick look
at some of the new ways

1585
01:34:25,966 --> 01:34:30,604
you can work together with collaboration
with iPadOS 16.

1586
01:34:30,637 --> 01:34:32,873
In addition to Pages and Safari,

1587
01:34:32,906 --> 01:34:35,976
these new collaboration features
will work with a variety of apps,

1588
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:38,145
like Notes and Keynote.

1589
01:34:38,178 --> 01:34:42,616
And for developers, there's a new API
to integrate collaboration in their apps,

1590
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:47,354
and these features will also be coming
to iOS and macOS.

1591
01:34:47,387 --> 01:34:49,690
Of course,
when you're collaborating live,

1592
01:34:49,723 --> 01:34:52,226
sometimes you want a space
where you can brainstorm

1593
01:34:52,259 --> 01:34:54,895
and capture ideas as they strike.

1594
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:59,666
So today, we're giving you a sneak peek
at a brand-new app called Freeform

1595
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:01,602
coming later this year.

1596
01:35:01,635 --> 01:35:04,404
To tell you all about it,
here's Elizabeth.

1597
01:35:07,574 --> 01:35:10,577
Elizabeth Reid: We have so many
great ways to collaborate,

1598
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:13,313
but up until now,
you didn't have a space to work in,

1599
01:35:13,347 --> 01:35:16,450
a place for group sessions,
project planning,

1600
01:35:16,483 --> 01:35:18,485
home renovations, or school projects.

1601
01:35:18,519 --> 01:35:20,821
Now, you can be on a FaceTime call,

1602
01:35:20,854 --> 01:35:25,025
and with a tap, you're all collaborating
live on a Freeform board.

1603
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,060
You can add almost anything to a board.

1604
01:35:27,094 --> 01:35:30,297
It's perfect for brainstorming sessions,
jotting down notes,

1605
01:35:30,330 --> 01:35:33,567
sharing files,
or even creating diagrams with others.

1606
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,070
It's flexible,
limited only by your imagination.

1607
01:35:37,104 --> 01:35:38,906
As others begin adding their thoughts,

1608
01:35:38,939 --> 01:35:42,509
you can see their live cursors
showing you right where they're working.

1609
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:44,545
And if someone is in
another part of Freeform,

1610
01:35:44,578 --> 01:35:47,681
you can just tap to jump straight
to where they are on the board.

1611
01:35:47,714 --> 01:35:51,718
And any time you need more space,
move around simply using touch,

1612
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:54,855
or focus on what's really important
with a pinch.

1613
01:35:54,888 --> 01:35:57,758
Of course, with a full complement
of drawing tools,

1614
01:35:57,791 --> 01:36:01,995
you can sketch or write a note
anywhere you'd like with Apple Pencil.

1615
01:36:02,029 --> 01:36:05,632
And with all the powerful tools
to create content on iPad,

1616
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:08,101
Freeform is a great place
to pull it all together,

1617
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:11,605
including photos, video, audio,

1618
01:36:11,638 --> 01:36:14,708
documents, PDFs, web links,

1619
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:18,946
pretty much anything you need to work with
can be brought onto your board.

1620
01:36:18,979 --> 01:36:22,449
And you can preview right in line,
including multipage documents

1621
01:36:22,482 --> 01:36:24,117
and high-resolution videos,

1622
01:36:24,151 --> 01:36:25,485
giving you everything you need

1623
01:36:25,519 --> 01:36:28,755
to bring your ideas to life
right at your fingertips.

1624
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:30,691
And that's a sneak peek at Freeform.

1625
01:36:30,724 --> 01:36:33,293
Back to you, Craig.

1626
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:35,529
Craig: Freeform is going to be
a great way

1627
01:36:35,562 --> 01:36:37,397
to brainstorm your ideas with others,

1628
01:36:37,431 --> 01:36:40,467
and we're building it right into iPadOS,

1629
01:36:40,501 --> 01:36:43,370
macOS, and iOS later this year.

1630
01:36:43,403 --> 01:36:47,774
Of course, the versatility of iPad
means you can seamlessly move

1631
01:36:47,808 --> 01:36:50,811
from being productive to gaming.

1632
01:36:50,844 --> 01:36:53,780
With its stunning display,
built-in sensors,

1633
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:56,183
and support for your
favorite game controller,

1634
01:36:56,216 --> 01:36:59,620
iPad provides a great gaming experience.

1635
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:03,056
And the M1 chip
delivers high-performance graphics,

1636
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:07,427
enabling immersive games
like Divinity: Original Sin 2.

1637
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:11,331
In iPadOS 16,
we have some great updates to gaming,

1638
01:37:11,365 --> 01:37:13,467
starting with Metal 3,

1639
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:15,969
which brings the same MetalFX upscaling

1640
01:37:16,003 --> 01:37:21,642
and fast resource loading API to iPad
that we talked about earlier with macOS.

1641
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:23,911
There's also a new API

1642
01:37:23,944 --> 01:37:27,548
that lets games download
large assets in the background,

1643
01:37:27,581 --> 01:37:32,152
enabling you to multitask
while the download completes.

1644
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:37,157
Another important aspect to gaming on iPad
is how it brings us together.

1645
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:40,227
Tens of thousands of games
use Game Center to help us

1646
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,430
play with our friends
or compete against each other.

1647
01:37:43,463 --> 01:37:47,501
It's easy to jump right in and play
without creating a new account,

1648
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:50,170
using your Game Center profile.

1649
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:54,107
You can find friends to play with,
compare scores on leaderboards,

1650
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:56,643
and track progress through achievements.

1651
01:37:56,677 --> 01:38:00,747
And now, we're bringing Activity
to the Game Center dashboard.

1652
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:04,184
You can see what your friends are playing,
highlights of their achievements,

1653
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:06,854
and even find out
when they beat your high score,

1654
01:38:06,887 --> 01:38:10,057
so you know when it's time
to take your game to the next level

1655
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,992
and get back on top.

1656
01:38:12,025 --> 01:38:15,929
And all of this activity appears
on your Game Center profile.

1657
01:38:15,963 --> 01:38:19,800
Game Center has always supported
playing together in real time.

1658
01:38:19,833 --> 01:38:24,104
Now, SharePlay makes it simple
to join and play.

1659
01:38:24,137 --> 01:38:26,473
In a multiplayer game using Game Center,

1660
01:38:26,507 --> 01:38:31,111
just start a SharePlay session
and bring your friends right in.

1661
01:38:31,144 --> 01:38:34,114
These new Game Center features
will be coming to an update

1662
01:38:34,147 --> 01:38:37,117
to iPadOS 16 later this year,

1663
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:41,088
and we're also bringing them
to iOS and macOS.

1664
01:38:41,121 --> 01:38:45,359
The versatility of iPad
makes it great for so many things,

1665
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:48,262
and a big part of that is apps.

1666
01:38:48,295 --> 01:38:52,900
This year, we're continuing our work
to make iPad apps more capable

1667
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:55,869
with desktop-class apps.

1668
01:38:55,903 --> 01:38:59,306
While many iPad apps
have their origins in iOS,

1669
01:38:59,339 --> 01:39:03,410
over the years, they've taken on
their own unique capabilities,

1670
01:39:03,443 --> 01:39:06,947
optimized for the iPad's larger display.

1671
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:10,817
In iPadOS 16,
we scoured the entire system,

1672
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:13,353
adding enhancements across the board,

1673
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:15,722
from system elements and interactions

1674
01:39:15,756 --> 01:39:19,960
to new features you use on Mac
and want on iPad.

1675
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:21,862
Let me highlight a few of them.

1676
01:39:21,895 --> 01:39:24,565
Undo/redo across the system,

1677
01:39:24,598 --> 01:39:26,867
availability view in Calendar,

1678
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:30,904
find and merge cards
and create lists in Contacts,

1679
01:39:30,938 --> 01:39:33,073
and we have a big update to Files,

1680
01:39:33,106 --> 01:39:35,108
with some of the most requested features,

1681
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:37,611
such as the ability to change
file extensions,

1682
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:40,247
view folder size, and more.

1683
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:45,018
We've also added system-wide features
that deliver improvements across apps,

1684
01:39:45,052 --> 01:39:48,021
starting with a redesigned
find and replace experience

1685
01:39:48,055 --> 01:39:50,023
that works in-line.

1686
01:39:50,057 --> 01:39:53,861
A document menu in apps
like Files, Pages, and Keynote

1687
01:39:53,894 --> 01:39:56,196
that reveals common actions
you may want to take,

1688
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:59,900
such as duplicate,
rename, export, and print.

1689
01:39:59,933 --> 01:40:04,905
And for the first time ever,
customizable toolbars in iPadOS

1690
01:40:04,938 --> 01:40:08,208
so you can add the tools
that matter to you most.

1691
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:11,311
And for developers,
we've created new APIs,

1692
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:15,315
so they can build these capabilities
right into their own apps.

1693
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:18,418
These features will help you
be more productive.

1694
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:20,988
And we have another feature
for Mac that will be great

1695
01:40:21,021 --> 01:40:23,123
for creative pros on iPad.

1696
01:40:23,156 --> 01:40:25,492
And that is reference color.

1697
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:30,097
The Liquid Retina XDR display
in our latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro

1698
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:33,267
is great for professional color workflows.

1699
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,638
And with iPadOS 16,
we're introducing Reference Mode,

1700
01:40:37,671 --> 01:40:41,575
which meets the color requirements
in workflows like review and approve,

1701
01:40:41,608 --> 01:40:43,710
color grading, and compositing,

1702
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:47,748
where accurate colors
and consistent image quality are critical.

1703
01:40:47,781 --> 01:40:51,485
So whether you prefer using iPad Pro
as a standalone device

1704
01:40:51,518 --> 01:40:54,087
or as a second display with Sidecar,

1705
01:40:54,121 --> 01:40:57,624
Reference Mode provides
a consistent reference workflow

1706
01:40:57,658 --> 01:40:59,293
across your pro devices,

1707
01:40:59,326 --> 01:41:04,398
making iPad Pro an indispensable tool
for creative professionals.

1708
01:41:04,431 --> 01:41:07,734
Now, I want to turn our attention
to a set of features

1709
01:41:07,768 --> 01:41:10,838
enabled by the performance of the M1 chip

1710
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:14,374
in our latest iPad Pro and iPad Air.

1711
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:19,880
Features for people who push
the versatility of iPad to the limit.

1712
01:41:19,913 --> 01:41:22,916
Pros are always wanting
more space to work with,

1713
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,253
so we're adding
a new display scaling setting,

1714
01:41:26,286 --> 01:41:29,623
which allows you to increase
the pixel density of the display

1715
01:41:29,656 --> 01:41:31,525
so you can view more in your apps,

1716
01:41:31,558 --> 01:41:34,795
which is particularly helpful
when using Split View.

1717
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:38,065
We also want to enable you
to do more in apps.

1718
01:41:38,098 --> 01:41:40,000
Our latest iPad Air and iPad Pro

1719
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:44,104
come with a ton of ultra-fast memory
and storage.

1720
01:41:44,137 --> 01:41:48,509
iPadOS 16 adds support
for virtual memory swap,

1721
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:50,310
meaning your iPad storage can be used

1722
01:41:50,344 --> 01:41:53,380
to expand the available memory
for all apps

1723
01:41:53,413 --> 01:41:58,752
and delivers up to 16 GB of memory
to the most demanding apps.

1724
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:02,723
With technologies like display scaling
and virtual memory swap,

1725
01:42:02,756 --> 01:42:07,294
we have the foundation for a big leap
forward in user experience,

1726
01:42:07,327 --> 01:42:12,332
one that can change how our Pro users
get work done on iPad.

1727
01:42:12,366 --> 01:42:14,801
So we're bringing Stage Manager,

1728
01:42:14,835 --> 01:42:20,040
our latest windowing system
that you just saw in macOS, to iPadOS.

1729
01:42:20,073 --> 01:42:24,144
Stage Manager takes multitasking
on iPad to a whole new level

1730
01:42:24,178 --> 01:42:29,416
by making it more nimble and unlocking
full external display support.

1731
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:31,218
I'd like to show it to you now.

1732
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,988
Today on iPad, when you use apps,

1733
01:42:35,022 --> 01:42:38,325
you get the full screen experience
that we're all familiar with,

1734
01:42:38,358 --> 01:42:40,194
like in Photos here.

1735
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:44,531
With Stage Manager activated,
I can now resize windows,

1736
01:42:44,565 --> 01:42:48,669
exposing a powerful new way
to work with apps on iPad.

1737
01:42:48,702 --> 01:42:52,673
And the Dock is visible,
so I can easily get to all my apps.

1738
01:42:52,706 --> 01:42:54,741
Let's open Music.

1739
01:42:54,775 --> 01:42:58,178
You'll notice that all my recently used
apps appear on the left,

1740
01:42:58,212 --> 01:43:01,048
so switching between them is really fast.

1741
01:43:01,081 --> 01:43:04,618
And Stage Manager gives me
powerful new layout capabilities

1742
01:43:04,651 --> 01:43:07,187
to create my ideal workspace.

1743
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:11,592
For the first time on iPad,
I can work with overlapping windows.

1744
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:16,730
I'm gonna drag Messages
alongside Calendar here,

1745
01:43:16,763 --> 01:43:20,033
and Stage Manager automatically moves
Calendar gently off to the side

1746
01:43:20,067 --> 01:43:21,902
as I bring it to the stage.

1747
01:43:21,935 --> 01:43:25,372
And if I move Messages to the left,

1748
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:29,910
Stage Manager repositions Calendar for me
automatically.

1749
01:43:29,943 --> 01:43:32,779
And like you saw earlier,
I can resize windows

1750
01:43:32,813 --> 01:43:36,383
and arrange everything
just the way I want.

1751
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:38,118
And it gets even better

1752
01:43:38,151 --> 01:43:42,122
when I plug my iPad
into an external display.

1753
01:43:43,857 --> 01:43:47,261
My wallpaper beautifully fills
the entire display,

1754
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:51,098
and I can move my cursor to it
from my iPad.

1755
01:43:51,131 --> 01:43:55,169
I have the Dock here too,
so let's go ahead and launch Keynote.

1756
01:43:55,202 --> 01:43:58,405
When I do,
I once again enter Stage Manager,

1757
01:43:58,438 --> 01:44:01,241
now on an even bigger canvas.

1758
01:44:01,275 --> 01:44:03,944
All of that additional screen real estate
is so useful

1759
01:44:03,977 --> 01:44:06,580
when working on a presentation in Keynote.

1760
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:09,082
And it's amazing when you're working
with a set of apps.

1761
01:44:09,116 --> 01:44:13,854
I can create groups of three
and even four windows.

1762
01:44:13,887 --> 01:44:16,123
This is just incredibly powerful.

1763
01:44:16,156 --> 01:44:19,026
Between my iPad and my external display,

1764
01:44:19,059 --> 01:44:23,130
I can have up to eight apps
running onscreen simultaneously.

1765
01:44:23,163 --> 01:44:28,235
And I can take advantage of the unique
capabilities of each of these displays.

1766
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:31,205
For instance,
I'm working on this Keynote document,

1767
01:44:31,238 --> 01:44:34,541
and I want to add a drawing from Procreate

1768
01:44:34,575 --> 01:44:37,845
here on my iPad.

1769
01:44:37,878 --> 01:44:41,515
I can use Apple Pencil
to add a finishing touch

1770
01:44:41,548 --> 01:44:43,417
to my drawing.

1771
01:44:48,255 --> 01:44:51,024
And now I can jump back into the gallery

1772
01:44:51,058 --> 01:44:56,263
and then drag and drop across displays
and into my deck.

1773
01:44:56,296 --> 01:45:00,367
And that's a quick look at Stage Manager.

1774
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,671
It's an entirely new way to multitask
with multiple overlapping windows,

1775
01:45:04,705 --> 01:45:08,208
flexible window sets,
fast app switching,

1776
01:45:08,242 --> 01:45:11,278
and full external display support.

1777
01:45:11,311 --> 01:45:14,147
And that's iPadOS 16,

1778
01:45:14,181 --> 01:45:17,985
a big release with exciting updates
to many of the built-in apps;

1779
01:45:18,018 --> 01:45:20,087
Weather app comes to iPad,

1780
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,856
new ways to collaborate
and be productive,

1781
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:26,560
great features for pro users,
including Stage Manager,

1782
01:45:26,593 --> 01:45:28,595
and so much more.

1783
01:45:28,629 --> 01:45:31,398
Now, back to Tim.

1784
01:45:31,431 --> 01:45:32,933
Tim: Thank you, Craig.

1785
01:45:32,966 --> 01:45:35,435
And thanks to all of our presenters.

1786
01:45:35,469 --> 01:45:38,172
What an exciting day of announcements!

1787
01:45:38,205 --> 01:45:41,808
We introduced the all-new,
redesigned MacBook Air,

1788
01:45:41,842 --> 01:45:45,579
with its super-thin enclosure,
Liquid Retina display,

1789
01:45:45,612 --> 01:45:48,382
MagSafe, beautiful new finishes,

1790
01:45:48,415 --> 01:45:50,584
and supercharged by M2,

1791
01:45:50,617 --> 01:45:53,921
our next generation of Apple Silicon.

1792
01:45:53,954 --> 01:45:57,457
Along with a powerful new
13-inch MacBook Pro,

1793
01:45:57,491 --> 01:46:00,427
also supercharged by M2.

1794
01:46:00,460 --> 01:46:04,965
And we pushed our software platforms
forward in some incredible new ways.

1795
01:46:04,998 --> 01:46:09,136
Introducing features and capabilities
that will enable our developers

1796
01:46:09,169 --> 01:46:14,675
to do amazing work and provide our users
with exciting new experiences.

1797
01:46:14,708 --> 01:46:19,246
Our OS releases will be available
as developer betas today,

1798
01:46:19,279 --> 01:46:22,950
and each of them will have a public beta
next month.

1799
01:46:22,983 --> 01:46:27,688
All of these OS releases
will be available to our users this fall.

1800
01:46:28,889 --> 01:46:32,860
I'm confident that our incredible products
and innovative platforms

1801
01:46:32,893 --> 01:46:37,364
will inspire developers
to do the very best work of their lives,

1802
01:46:37,397 --> 01:46:42,035
enabling all of us to do
even more amazing things.

1803
01:46:42,069 --> 01:46:44,171
We hope you enjoyed today's event,

1804
01:46:44,204 --> 01:46:46,874
and we have a huge week ahead.

1805
01:46:46,907 --> 01:46:50,377
We will be offering
a comprehensive online experience,

1806
01:46:50,410 --> 01:46:52,880
starting with
a Platform State of the Union

1807
01:46:52,913 --> 01:46:57,985
for those developers who want take
a deeper dive into our announcements.

1808
01:46:58,018 --> 01:47:01,822
And there will be more than 175 sessions,

1809
01:47:01,855 --> 01:47:05,158
as well as one-on-one labs
with Apple engineers

1810
01:47:05,192 --> 01:47:07,261
and digital lounges.

1811
01:47:07,294 --> 01:47:10,831
All of this is available for free
to all our developers

1812
01:47:10,864 --> 01:47:14,101
to help them get the most
out of the conference.

1813
01:47:14,134 --> 01:47:18,906
Thank you for joining us,
and let's have a great WWDC!
