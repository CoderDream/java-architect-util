00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:12,933
很容易就可以进一步调整成我想要的样子
it's easy to dial it in further to get it just the way I want it

101
00:07:12,966 --> 00:07:16,770
我可以轻点锁定屏幕上的任何元素
All I need to do is tap on any element of the Lock Screen to start editing

102
00:07:16,803 --> 00:07:17,304
直接进行编辑

103
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:19,406
让我来自定义字型

我可以尝试不同的字体

00:07:22,042 --> 00:07:25,045
还有不同的颜色

106

我喜欢这个颜色

我还可以在锁定屏幕上添加小组件来增加实用性
Now, I can also make my Lock Screen more helpful

102
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:35,822
by putting widgets right on the Lock Screen

110
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:38,125
让我把女儿的照片往下移一点
So let me move the girls down here

111
00:07:38,158 --> 00:07:41,361
再轻点进入小组件库
and tap in to bring up the widget gallery

112
00:07:41,395 --> 00:07:44,831
这些可以让你一览无余各类信息

113
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:46,333
比如日历上的下一个日程

00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,441
再拖入日历小组件

这看起来棒极了
Now, this is great

118
00:07:56,076 --> 00:08:00,414
更棒的是锁定屏幕可以不止一个

00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,100
让我可以选一组照片在一天里随机滚动显示

126

另外还有建议照片都是从我的个人图库中精选出的

例如为家人拍的最棒的照片

128
00:08:27,508 --> 00:08:29,042

快速轻松地将 app 的信息概览放在锁定屏幕上

that you can always enjoy it, even if you get a lot of notifications

147
00:09:22,563 --> 00:09:25,766
有时候通知会遮盖住锁定屏幕上你的个人照片
Sometimes, notifications can cover up your personal photo

148
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:28,769
所以我们重新构思了通知的出现方式
So we've rethought how they appear

149
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:33,073
现在当你收到通知时它们将在锁屏底部滚动显示
Notifications now roll in from the bottom of the Lock Screen as you receive them

150
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,342
当然你也可以选择将其隐藏起来
and you can choose to hide them throughout the day

151
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:38,946
有时候你会从某个 app 收到一连串的通知
Now, sometimes you get a bunch of notifications from an app

152
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41,782
比如说你正在关注一场篮球赛的比分
like when you're following the score of a basketball game

153
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:44,451
现在呢有个更好的方法来追踪动态
Well, now there's a better way to keep tabs

154
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:47,855
那就是实时活动
with something called Live Activities

155
00:09:47,888 --> 00:09:54,828
更便于你通过锁定屏幕实时跟进正在发生的动态
Live Activities make it easier to stay on top of things

146
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:54,828
that are happening in real time right from your Lock Screen

156
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:58,832
开发者们在今年晚些时候 iOS 16 的一次更新后
And for developers, starting in an update to iOS 16 later this year

157
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:01,368
可以通过实时活动 API
they can use the Live Activities API

158
00:10:01,401 --> 00:10:05,138
来打造这些设计紧凑又一目了然的体验
to create these compact and glanceable experiences

159
00:10:05,172 --> 00:10:08,475
这将方便用户关注 NBA 球赛
This will make it really easy to follow that NBA game

160
00:10:08,509 --> 00:10:10,878
追踪 Uber 行程的进度
track the progress of an Uber ride

161
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:14,481
跟进个人锻炼情况等
see how you're doing on your workout, and more

162
00:10:14,515 --> 00:10:18,185
同时不影响锁定屏幕上的其他元素显示
all while letting the other elements on the Lock Screen shine

163
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:22,589
我们当中很多人最爱做的就是听音乐
One of the most popular activities for many of us is listening to music

164
00:10:22,623 --> 00:10:24,191
那现在有了实时活动
And now with Live Activities, the Now Playing controls can expand

165
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:27,561
“播放中”控件就可以延展到全屏视图

166
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:30,664
让你可以边听音乐边欣赏专辑封面
to a full screen view that celebrates album art while you listen along

167
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:34,201
这就是全新的锁定屏幕
So that's the all-new Lock Screen

168
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:37,304
这些更新同时带来了强大的新方式
There are some really powerful ways these updates tie together

169
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:41,141
和我们去年推出的专注模式相整合
and build upon what we introduced last year with Focus

170
00:10:41,175 --> 00:10:45,412
专注模式帮助我们减少干扰并集中精力于当下
Focus has helped people reduce distractions and stay in the moment

171
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,848
今年我们进一步提升了专注模式
And this year, we're taking it further

172
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:51,151
首先就是将其带到了锁定屏幕
starting with extending Focus to your Lock Screen

173
00:10:51,185 --> 00:10:54,388
这意味着你所选的照片和小组件
This means your choice of a photo and widgets

174
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,924
可以与某个特定的专注模式相互绑定
can all be tied to a particular Focus

175
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:59,526
现在既然可以有多个锁定屏幕
And now that you can have multiple Lock Screens

176
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,130
你可将它们和一天中不同的专注模式相匹配
you can match them to the appropriate Focus throughout your day

177
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:06,433
你可以为工作专注模式设置相应的锁定屏幕
You can have a dedicated one for when you're in a Work Focus

178
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:09,369
加上小组件来显示下一个会议日程或待完成事项清单
with widgets showing your upcoming meeting or to-do list

179
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:13,340
或者轻扫一下启动你的个人专注模式
Or, with just a swipe, you can activate your Personal Focus

180
00:11:13,373 --> 00:11:16,243
你所有相应的通知设置也将同时应用
All of your corresponding notification settings apply

181
00:11:16,276 --> 00:11:19,246
并启动相应的主屏幕
and it extends to your Home Screen too

182
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,982
你可以保留自己喜爱的常用 app 或小组件
So now you can elevate your favorite apps or widgets

183
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:24,885
与亲友保持联系
for keeping up with friends and family

184
00:11:24,918 --> 00:11:28,822
现在你的专注模式也可应用于 app 层级
And now, your Focus can also carry into the apps themselves

185
00:11:28,856 --> 00:11:30,424
利用专注模式过滤条件
with Focus filters, which let you filter out distracting content

186
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:33,160
减少令人分心的内容

187
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,162
比如说 Safari 浏览器
Let's take Safari, for example

188
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,497
与其看到你所有的网页
Instead of seeing all of your websites

189
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,600
你可以打开工作专注模式过滤条件
you can turn on the Work Focus filter and see only the tabs that relate to work

190
00:11:39,633 --> 00:11:42,069
只保留和工作相关的标签页

191
00:11:42,102 --> 00:11:45,606
除了 Safari 浏览器中的标签页组
And you can filter not just tab groups in Safari

192
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,774
你还可以过滤信息 app 中的某些对话
but also conversations in Messages, accounts in Mail, and events in Calendar

193
00:11:47,808 --> 00:11:49,142
邮件 app 中的某些账户

194
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,878
以及日历 app 中的某些日程

195
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,046
我们为开发者提供了新的 API
And for developers, we have a new API

196
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:56,316
帮助你在使用他们开发的 app 时也能保持专注
so they can help you focus in their apps as well

197
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,353
这些专注模式的更新可以帮你来设定界限
These updates to Focus can help you draw boundaries

198
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:02,823
助你平衡生活中的各个时刻
and find balance throughout all of the moments in your life

199
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:07,127
现在让我们来聊聊信息 app 的新功能
Now, let's talk about what's in store for Messages

200
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,164
每天数以亿计的人依靠着信息 app
Hundreds of millions of people rely on Messages every single day

201
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:15,502
它成为了不可或缺的工具让我们和至亲挚爱保持联络
It's integral to how we communicate with the people who matter most

202
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:20,040
今天我们为信息 app 添加了三个呼声最高的新功能
And now, we're adding three of the most highly-requested features to Messages

203
00:12:20,807 --> 00:12:23,310
首先你是不是有过发送消息后
First, have you ever sent a Message only to immediately realize

204
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:27,214
立即意识到没有准确表达你的意思？
you didn't quite say what you intended?

205
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:28,315
不用担心
Well, no worries

206
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:31,919
现在你可以编辑刚发送出去的信息
Because now you can edit any message you just sent

207
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:35,589
不必再担心令人尴尬的错别字
so embarrassing typos can be a thing of the past

208
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:39,927
其次你是不是有过其实根本不想发出去的信息？
Second, have you ever wished you'd never sent that message at all?

209
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:43,096
好消息！现在有了撤销发送功能
Well, good news–now you have undo send

210
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:46,500
你可以赶紧撤回刚才的失误
so you can immediately recall a recent misfire

211
00:12:46,533 --> 00:12:50,237
最后你可以将对话标记为未读
And finally, you can now mark any thread as unread

212
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,973
尤其适合你当下没空回复
a perfect tool if you don't have time to respond in the moment

213
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:56,276
但又想待会查看的情况下
and want to be sure to come back to a message later

214
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:59,079
这三个功能将大大改变
These three features are going to make a big difference

215
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,515
你日常如何使用信息 app
in how you use Messages every single day

216
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:04,751
信息 app 不仅可以简单高效发送信息
Messages makes texting easy and efficient, and it's also a great way to share

217
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:07,888
还便于大家共享内容

218
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,891
去年我们推出了与你共享功能
Last year, we introduced Shared with You, which takes things like photos, links

219
00:13:10,924 --> 00:13:15,963
朋友们在信息 app 与你分享的照片、链接、音乐

204
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,064
and music that your friends share with you in Messages and highlights them

220
00:13:15,996 --> 00:13:20,300
会在相应的 app 中突出显示以便你回头去欣赏
right in the app where you'd like to enjoy them later

221
00:13:20,334 --> 00:13:25,539
而我们很高兴推出新的 API 让开发者们可以调用与你共享
And for developers, we're really excited

207
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:25,539
to make Shared with You available with a new API

222
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:28,041
这样当有人给你发送有趣视频
So when someone sends you a funny video, a worthwhile article

223
00:13:28,075 --> 00:13:29,276
值得一看的文章

224
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,246
或你当下没空查看的食谱
or a recipe that you don't have time to check out in the moment

225
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:35,582
下次你在开启相应的 app 时会出现在你眼前
it'll be there waiting for you the next time you open that app

226
00:13:36,216 --> 00:13:38,819
而如果是实时与他人分享的话
And when it comes to sharing in real time with others, people are loving SharePlay

227
00:13:38,852 --> 00:13:41,388
同播共享就是人们非常喜爱的功能

228
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:43,023
带来了独一无二的神奇体验
It's stellar for enjoying shared experiences

229
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,692
在 FaceTime 通话同时共享精彩内容
while connecting over FaceTime

230
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,327
比如一起追剧
Like watching TV shows, listening to music

231
00:13:47,361 --> 00:13:48,495
一起听音乐

232
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:51,832
还有一起大汗淋漓地锻炼
or breaking a sweat to a synced up workout

233
00:13:51,865 --> 00:13:54,434
许多大家常用的 app 都基于同播共享
So many of your favorite apps are using SharePlay

234
00:13:54,468 --> 00:13:56,136
来创建共享体验
to create shared experiences

235
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:59,473
比如一起听 Better Sleep 的睡前故事
like listening to bedtime stories together with Better Sleep

236
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,375
或者在 Heads Up 一起畅玩游戏
or playing a rowdy game of Heads Up, no matter how far apart you are

237
00:14:01,408 --> 00:14:03,443
不管你们相距多远

238
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:04,578
而今年
And this year, we're making it easier to discover

239
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:10,417
在 FaceTime 通话中也将更容易发现这些精彩的同播共享体验
all of these awesome SharePlay experiences from within your FaceTime call

240
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,852
只需轻点一下
With just a tap, you can jump into SharePlay-supported apps

241
00:14:11,885 --> 00:14:15,656
就能找到手机上已经支持同播共享的 app

223
00:14:13,787 --> 00:14:17,491
that you already have on your phone, or discover new experiences

242
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:19,193
或者发现可以和朋友们分享的新体验
that you can share with your friends

243
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:22,963
而为了让你有更多机会来共享体验
And to give you more opportunities to enjoy shared experiences

244
00:14:22,996 --> 00:14:25,699
我们正把同播共享扩展到 FaceTime 通话之外
we're extending SharePlay beyond FaceTime and bringing it to Messages

245
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,768
将其带入信息 app 中！

246
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:30,804
这是来自开发者们的第一大要求
This was the number one request from developers

247
00:14:30,838 --> 00:14:32,873
现在如果你有想分享的东西
Now when you find something you want to share

248
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,708
例如 Disney+ 的一部电影

249
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:37,077
你只需要在那里开启同播共享
like a movie on Disney+, you can kick off SharePlay right there

250
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,047
就能够一边看电影一边在信息 app 里聊天
and enjoy it together while chatting in Messages

251
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,248
不仅可以同步观看
You can watch in sync, and you've got the same instantaneous

252
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:44,785
播放控制也可实时同步

253
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,653
带来奇妙的同播共享体验
shared playback controls that make SharePlay magical

254
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,090
所以不管是要同播共享你每周的电影之夜
So whether you're using SharePlay for your weekly movie night

255
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:52,926
或是将信息标为未读以便稍后回复
or marking a message unread so you can respond later

256
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:56,897
信息 app 能满足你各种需求让你轻松保持联系
Messages has everything you need to connect with ease

257
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:00,701
此外编写信息也更方便了
And we're making it that much easier to compose Messages

258
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,103
这归功于听写功能的一些更新
with some updates to Dictation

259
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:05,572
下面有请 Robby 来给你分享
To tell you more, here's Robby

260
00:15:08,475 --> 00:15:11,245
Robby Walker: 通过听写你只需动口就能输入文字
Robby Walker: Dictation lets you type just by speaking

261
00:15:11,278 --> 00:15:14,581
可以比用键盘打字更快
and can be much faster than typing with the Keyboard

262
00:15:14,615 --> 00:15:19,419
所以它常用来做记录、发信息等
This is why it's so popular for taking notes, sending messages, and more

263
00:15:19,453 --> 00:15:24,291
事实上听写功能使用频次每个月超过 180 亿
In fact, Dictation is used over 18 billion times each month

264
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,427
同时这一功能在设计上已将隐私保护考虑其中
And it's designed to protect your privacy

265
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:32,132
多亏神经网络引擎听写可以完全在设备端运行
Thanks to the Neural Engine, Dictation can happen entirely on-device

266
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:37,905
今天我们很高兴带来全新的设备端听写体验
Today, we're excited to introduce an all-new on-device Dictation experience

267
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:41,875
让你在语音和触控之间流畅切换
that lets you fluidly move between voice and touch

268
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,710
让我们来看看
Let's take a look

269
00:15:43,744 --> 00:15:47,648
我将用新的听写功能来发送这封邮件
We'll use our new dictation experience to send an email

270
00:15:47,681 --> 00:15:51,385
现在当我使用听写功能的同时键盘也保持启用
Now, when I start dictating, the keyboard stays open

271
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:54,755
这样我可以在语音和触控输入间自由切换
so I can switch between using voice and touch

272
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,529
我甚至可以用触控选择文本
I can even select text using touch and replace it with my voice

273
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:07,634
然后用语音进行替换

274
00:16:07,668 --> 00:16:09,903
只需动口即可
Just by speaking

275
00:16:09,937 --> 00:16:12,439
你在编辑一段较长的信息吗
Are you sending a longer message?

276
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:16,243
听写能自动在文字里加入标点符号
Dictation automatically adds punctuation to the text

277
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,981
好酷爆炸头表情符号
"That's so cool! Mind blown emoji!"

278
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:27,754
当你用 Siri 发送消息时也可自动添加标点符号和听写表情符号
Automatic punctuation and emoji dictation also work

257
00:16:24,852 --> 00:16:27,754
when you send messages with Siri

279
00:16:27,788 --> 00:16:31,959
而今年要在其他 app 里使用 Siri 也变得更方便了
And this year, we're making it easier to use Siri with apps

280
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:35,662
目前有超过 15000 个 app 可与 Siri 配合使用
There are over 15,000 apps that work with Siri

281
00:16:35,696 --> 00:16:38,131
都是基于 SiriKit 和 Siri 快捷指令
using SiriKit and Siri Shortcuts

282
00:16:38,165 --> 00:16:41,468
目前为止许多操控仍需要手动设置
And today, these require manual setup

283
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,638
所以我们推出了一个新的开发者 API
So we're introducing a new developer API

284
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:48,075
由 Swift 编码语言编写称之为 App Intents
built using the Swift programming language called App Intents

285
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:51,044
现在无需设置就可运行快捷指令
Now shortcuts work with zero setup

286
00:16:51,078 --> 00:16:54,615
直接在所支持的各类 app 里靠 Siri 来完成任务
so you can use Siri to get things done with supported apps

287
00:16:54,648 --> 00:16:57,784
现在让我们来谈谈另一个由智能技术驱动的功能
Now let's talk about another feature powered by intelligence: Live Text

288
00:16:57,818 --> 00:16:59,386
实况文本

289
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,154
实况文本真的很有用
Live Text is so useful

290
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:04,424
因为它深入集成于整个操作系统中
because it's deeply integrated across the entire OS

291
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:08,095
让你能交互使用整个系统里图片中的文字
letting you interact with text in images across the system

292
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:10,397
不管是相机 app、Safari 浏览器
from Camera and Safari to Notes and Screenshots

293
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,499
备忘录 app 甚至是截屏中

294
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:16,270
今年我们很高兴将这样的深度集成更进一步
And this year, we're excited to take this integration further

295
00:17:16,303 --> 00:17:18,839
将实况文本带到视频里！
by bringing Live Text to video

296
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:21,575
现在你可以在任何帧暂停视频
Now you can pause a video on any frame and interact with text

297
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:23,310
交互使用里面的文字

298
00:17:23,343 --> 00:17:25,812
就像之前在照片里那样
just like you can today with photos

299
00:17:25,846 --> 00:17:28,448
比如直接在编程视频里复制代码示例
It's great for copying code samples

300
00:17:28,482 --> 00:17:33,453
我们还增加了一些基于实况文本的快速操作
We're also accelerating the things you do with Live Text with quick actions

301
00:17:33,487 --> 00:17:35,189
例如只需要轻点一下
So now you're just a tap away from converting currency

302
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:38,659
来换算汇率或者翻译外文
and translating a foreign language

303
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:42,162
若要更丰富的翻译体验
And for an even richer translation experience

304
00:17:42,196 --> 00:17:47,701
可以调用翻译 app 中的新相机视图使用实况文本
you'll be able to use Live Text while in the Translate app

281
00:17:45,566 --> 00:17:47,701
with our new camera view

305
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,838
这尤其适用于有大量文本需要翻译的时候
This will be great for when you have lots of text to translate

306
00:17:50,871 --> 00:17:55,676
而我们也很高兴为开发者带来实况文本 API
And for developers, we're also excited to announce a Live Text API

307
00:17:55,709 --> 00:18:02,216
很快你就可以直接在 Vimeo 等 app 中从照片或视频截取文本
Soon you will be able to grab text straight from photos

285
00:17:59,646 --> 00:18:02,216
and videos in apps like Vimeo

308
00:18:02,249 --> 00:18:05,152
当然照片里远不止有文本
And photos are about more than just text

309
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:08,121
所以我们去年推出了 Visual Look Up 这个功能
That's why last year we introduced Visual Look Up

310
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:13,193
用来识别如宠物、地标、植物等主体
a feature that recognizes objects like pets, landmarks, plants, and more

311
00:18:13,227 --> 00:18:16,897
为你提供图片里丰富的资讯
and gives you rich information about what's in your images

312
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:21,134
而且今年我们还有一个新功能进一步推动图像理解
And this year we have a new feature that takes image understanding further

313
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,472
现在只要长按图片里的主体
Now when you touch and hold on the subject of an image

314
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:27,107
就能将其从背景提取出来
you can lift it away from the background and place it in apps like Messages

315
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,910
然后再拖放到信息 app 等各类 app 中

316
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,979
就像变魔术一样
It feels like magic

317
00:18:32,012 --> 00:18:34,982
这实际上得益于一种先进的机器学习模型
It's actually the product of an advanced machine learning model

318
00:18:35,015 --> 00:18:38,418
由 CoreML 和神经网络引擎加速
which is accelerated by CoreML

296
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:40,487
and the Neural Engine to perform 40 billion operations

319
00:18:38,452 --> 00:18:42,055
在几毫秒之内执行 400 亿次运算
in just milliseconds

320
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:45,325
实况文本和 Visual Look Up 两大功能
Together, Live Text and Visual Look Up continue to unlock

321
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:50,564
源源不断地解锁照片和视频中丰富且有益的信息
rich and useful information from your photos and videos

322
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:54,168
覆盖了 iOS、iPadOS 和 macOS 各个系统
across iOS, iPadOS, and macOS

323
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:55,602
回到你了 Craig
Back to you, Craig

324
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:01,608
Craig: 这些智能功能可以帮助你轻松搞定各种事物
Craig: These intelligence features help you get things done with ease

325
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:04,144
另一个让生活更方便的 app
And another app that makes life easier is Wallet

326
00:19:04,178 --> 00:19:05,312
是钱包 app

327
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:09,183
接下来有请 Corey 来给你介绍钱包 app 有些什么新东西
To tell you about what's new in Wallet, I'll hand it over to Corey

328
00:19:11,952 --> 00:19:13,921
Corey Fugman: 凭借 Apple 钱包 app 我们正努力实现的终极目标
Corey Fugman: With Apple Wallet, we're working hard

329
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,823
就是取代你的实体钱包
on our goal to replace your physical wallet

330
00:19:16,857 --> 00:19:20,127
比如将驾照和各类 ID 卡添加到钱包 app
Take what we're doing with driver's licenses and ID cards

331
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,863
很高兴我们已在马里兰和亚利桑那成功推出
We're excited to have launched Maryland and Arizona

332
00:19:22,896 --> 00:19:26,400
在美国另外 11 个州也正积极展开部署
with 11 additional states actively working on deployments

333
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:29,536
最早接受钱包 app 中 ID 卡的是
And the first locations now accepting Wallet IDs

334
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:32,005
指定的 TSA 安全检查点
are select TSA security checkpoints

335
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:38,378
你也将能安全地向各类要求认证身份和年龄的 app 出示你的 ID
You'll also be able to securely present your ID

313
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:38,378
to apps requiring identity and age verification

336
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:42,816
基于隐私保护只有必须共享的信息才会被分享
To protect your privacy, only the necessary information will be shared

337
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,485
例如不需要提供你的详细生日日期
So rather than providing your exact birthday

338
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,055
只需分享你是 21 岁以上即可
you can simply share that you are over 21

339
00:19:48,088 --> 00:19:50,424
现在让我们来聊聊各类钥匙
Now, let's talk about Keys

340
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:52,459
我们的钱包 app 里不断增加的各类钥匙
Our growing suite of keys in Wallet makes it easy to access everyday places

341
00:19:52,492 --> 00:20:00,634
让你只需带着 iPhone 就可以轻松通行你的家、车、酒店和办公室
like your home, car, hotel, and office, all with just your iPhone

342
00:20:00,667 --> 00:20:03,504
现在我们也让共享钥匙变得更简单
And now we're making sharing keys even easier

343
00:20:03,537 --> 00:20:05,272
可通过你常用的几个通信 app
with your favorite messaging apps like Mail, Messages, or WhatsApp

344
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:08,075
如邮件 app、信息 app 或 WhatsApp 等

345
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,910
当你的朋友收到钥匙后
When your friend receives the key, they can add it to their Wallet

346
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,346
轻点一下就能将其加入自己的钱包 app
with a single tap

347
00:20:12,379 --> 00:20:15,549
为了让你也能和没有 iPhone 的人分享
And to let you share keys with people who don't have an iPhone

348
00:20:15,582 --> 00:20:17,484
我们也与 IETF 协作
we're working with the IETF to make sharing keys an industry standard

349
00:20:17,518 --> 00:20:21,522
让共享钥匙成为一个行业标准让大家免费采用
that is free for others to adopt

350
00:20:21,555 --> 00:20:24,958
我们的合作伙伴表现出极大的热情
We are seeing tremendous enthusiasm from our partners

351
00:20:24,992 --> 00:20:29,062
纷纷表示希望加入以提供用于各类场所的钥匙
with more of them signing on to support keys for all of the places you visit

352
00:20:29,096 --> 00:20:33,700
现在让我们来说说 Apple Pay 钱包 app 中最重要的一部分
Now let's talk about Apple Pay, one of the most important areas of Wallet

353
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,202
我们已经取得了很大进展
We've made a lot of progress with Apple Pay acceptance

354
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:37,638
各类商店和线上销售纷纷接受 Apple Pay

355
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:40,474
现在还正进一步扩展
in stores and online, and now we're expanding even further

356
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:43,343
这个月开始有了 iPhone 上的 Tap to Pay
Starting this month with Tap to Pay on iPhone

357
00:20:43,377 --> 00:20:49,516
美国各地数百万商家可以直接通过 iPhone 接受非接触支付
millions of merchants across the U.S. can accept contactless payments

358
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:52,519
也不需要额外的硬件或支付终端
directly on iPhone with no additional hardware or payment terminal needed

359
00:20:52,553 --> 00:20:55,055
借助支付提供商的 app
Beginning with apps from these payment providers

360
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:58,992
无论是小商户还是大零售商都能通过这个功能
Tap to Pay on iPhone enables small merchants and large retailers

361
00:20:59,026 --> 00:21:02,062
用 iPhone 安全地接受付款
to use iPhone to securely accept payments

362
00:21:02,095 --> 00:21:04,198
除了扩大接受范围
In addition to expanded acceptance, we're also enhancing Apple Pay

363
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:06,200
我们还提升了 Apple Pay

364
00:21:06,233 --> 00:21:08,402
以支持新的支付类型
to support new types of payments

365
00:21:08,435 --> 00:21:12,039
我们很高兴推出 Apple Pay Later
So we are thrilled to announce Apple Pay Later

366
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:15,742
该功能可让你将一笔 Apple Pay 支付款项
Apple Pay Later lets you split the cost of an Apple Pay purchase

367
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:19,179
分成四等额分摊在六周内还款
into four equal payments spread over six weeks

368
00:21:19,213 --> 00:21:22,382
而且没有利息或任何费用
with zero interest and no fees of any kind

369
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,353
Apple Pay Later 在所有接受 Apple Pay 的地方均可使用
And Apple Pay Later is available everywhere Apple Pay is accepted

370
00:21:26,386 --> 00:21:27,921
包括 app 内或者线上
in apps and online

371
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,457
例如你可以先买下心仪已久的这台咖啡机
You can now get that espresso machine you've wanted

372
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:32,125
之后再分期付款
and pay for it over time with no additional cost

373
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,794
而且无额外费用

374
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,829
开发者和商家们也不需担心
For developers and merchants, Apple Pay Later requires no integration

375
00:21:35,863 --> 00:21:38,365
Apple Pay Later 不需要额外的整合开发

376
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:41,969
只需标准的 Apple Pay 即可
It just works using their standard Apple Pay implementation

377
00:21:42,002 --> 00:21:44,771
分期还款通过钱包 app 管理
Upcoming payments are managed through Wallet

378
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:47,508
便于追踪什么时候该还什么款
making it easy to keep track of what's due when

379
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,510
帮你维持在预算范围内
and to stay within a budget

380
00:21:49,543 --> 00:21:51,445
而且在你下单后
And after you've placed your order

381
00:21:51,478 --> 00:21:54,248
我们还有一个全新功能帮助你追踪订单
we have another brand-new feature that helps you track it

382
00:21:54,281 --> 00:21:55,949
Apple Pay Order Tracking 功能
Apple Pay Order Tracking enables merchants

383
00:21:55,983 --> 00:22:00,120
使商家能将详细的收据和追踪信息

384
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:01,355
直接发送到钱包 app
to deliver detailed receipt and tracking information directly to Wallet

385
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:05,759
便于你获取 Apple Pay 订单的最新信息

387
00:22:08,862 --> 00:22:12,266
Apple Pay Order Tracking 功能将支持数以百万计的商家
Apple Pay Order Tracking will be offered at millions of merchants

388
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:15,068
基于 Shopify 等各大电商平台
through eCommerce platforms starting with Shopify

389
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:16,770
这就是我们给钱包 app 带来的更新
So that's our Wallet update. Back to you, Craig

390
00:22:16,803 --> 00:22:19,740
交回给你 Craig

391
00:22:19,773 --> 00:22:22,242
Craig: 有了更多地方接受钱包 app 里的 ID 卡
Craig: With ID cards available in more locations

392
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,912
以及使用和共享钥匙的新方式

393
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:27,814
还有Apple Pay Later 和 Apple Pay Order Tracking 等
Apple Pay Later, and Apple Pay Order Tracking

394
00:22:27,848 --> 00:22:30,117
钱包 app 让我们生活更方便
Wallet makes life so much easier, no matter where you go

395
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,585
不管是去到何处

396
00:22:31,618 --> 00:22:34,054
而带你到达目的地的好帮手
And the best way to get wherever you're going is with Maps

397
00:22:34,087 --> 00:22:35,656
当然是地图 app

398
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:38,825
让我们出去看看地图 app 有些什么更新
So let's get out of here to talk about what's new

00:23:12,192 --> 00:23:13,861
通过新的城市体验
And with the new city experience, we pushed it even further

409
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,598
我们进一步增加了许多详尽新细节

410
00:23:17,631 --> 00:23:20,400
例如土地覆盖、道路、高度信息等
with unprecedented detail for landcover, roads, and elevation

411
00:23:20,434 --> 00:23:24,271
同时也优化了驾驶导航和公交信息
as well as improved driving and transit navigation

412
00:23:24,304 --> 00:23:28,709
新增的城市如拉斯维加斯看起来美极了
And we're adding Las Vegas, which looks stunning

413
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:31,879
今年年底前我们将再添加 6 个城市
And before the end of the year, we'll add six more cities

414
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:35,349
包括迈阿密、芝加哥和悉尼
including Miami, Chicago, and Sydney

415
00:23:35,382 --> 00:23:38,986
下面请 Meg 来介绍地图 app 的其他更新
To tell you more about what's new in Maps, here's Meg

416
00:23:42,189 --> 00:23:48,529
Meg Frost: iOS 16 为地图 app 的用户和开发者带来了一系列出色的更新
Meg Frost: With iOS 16, we're introducing great updates

383
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:48,529
for Maps users and developers

417
00:23:48,562 --> 00:23:51,798
首先让我们来看看呼声最高的功能之一
Let's start with one of our most requested features:

418
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,734
多途径点路线规划
multistop routing

419
00:23:53,767 --> 00:23:57,504
你现在可以提前规划最多 15 个途径点
You can now plan up to 15 stops in advance

420
00:23:57,538 --> 00:24:00,741
地图 app 现在会在“最近”保存途径的路线
Maps will now store previous routes in Recents so they're easy to get back to

421
00:24:00,774 --> 00:24:02,409
便于你回看

422
00:24:02,442 --> 00:24:05,279
你也可以事先在 Mac 上规划多途径点路线
and you can plan multi-stop routes on the Mac

423
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:08,081
出发前再发送到 iPhone
and send them to iPhone when you're ready to go

424
00:24:08,115 --> 00:24:10,017
当然驾驶途中
And, of course, when you're driving

425
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:13,053
你也可以让 Siri 在路线添加新途径点
you can ask Siri to add additional stops to your route

426
00:24:13,086 --> 00:24:16,023
不用分散注意力以确保行驶安全
while safely keeping your eyes on the road

427
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:20,060
接下来让我们来谈谈用公交出行
Next, let's talk about getting around with transit

428
00:24:20,093 --> 00:24:23,163
乘客将能更方便地查看车费
We're making it easy for riders to see fares

429
00:24:23,197 --> 00:24:25,232
来预估整个行程的费用
for how much their journey will cost

430
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:28,402
还能直接将交通卡添加到钱包 app 里
along with the ability to add transit cards to Wallet

431
00:24:28,435 --> 00:24:31,305
交通卡余额不足时
And if a transit card balance is running low

432
00:24:31,338 --> 00:24:32,673
你也会收到通知
, you'll receive an alert

433
00:24:32,706 --> 00:24:35,909
让你无需离开地图 app 就可以充值
so you can reload it without having to leave Maps

434
00:24:35,943 --> 00:24:40,414
我们也为开发者带来了 MapKit 的重大优化提升
And for developers, we're making big improvements to MapKit

435
00:24:40,447 --> 00:24:43,984
首先是我们突破性的新城市体验
starting with our revolutionary new city experience

436
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:50,023
其中包括土地覆盖、道路、地标等丰富细节
which includes rich details for landcover, roads, landmarks, and more

437
00:24:50,057 --> 00:24:53,861
比如 Bird app 这样的开发者现在就可以将这一详细的地图整合进自己的 app 中
Developers like Bird can now integrate this detailed map

438
00:24:53,894 --> 00:24:57,164
便于用户寻找自行车和滑板车
so users can more easily locate bikes and scooters to get around town

439
00:24:57,197 --> 00:24:58,832
在城里到处转转

440
00:24:58,866 --> 00:25:03,136
而无论是在浅色模式还是深色模式下都看起来很美观
And it looks stunning in both Light and Dark Mode

441
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:04,938
还有更多
And there's more

442
00:25:04,972 --> 00:25:07,774
我们也会将四处看看添加到 MapKit 里
We're also bringing Look Around to MapKit

443
00:25:07,808 --> 00:25:12,045
这样就可以轻易将地图 app 的高清图像
making it easy to integrate high resolution imagery from Maps

444
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:13,647
引入到其他 app 如 Zillow
into apps like Zillow

445
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:19,019
帮助其用户在浏览房屋的时候获取沉浸式的视平线视图
helping users get an immersive ground-level view while browsing homes

446
00:25:19,052 --> 00:25:23,123
最后我们也欣喜宣布今年晚些时候
And finally, we're excited to announce that later this year

447
00:25:23,156 --> 00:25:26,226
开发者们将可以更快更灵活地
developers will have faster and more flexible ways

448
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,296
打造奇妙的地图体验

449
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,566
这都归功于全新的服务器端 API
to build incredible Maps experiences with brand-new server-side APIs

450
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,801
以上就是地图 app 更新的速览
And that's a quick look at Maps

451
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:36,837
交还给你 Craig！
Back to you, Craig!

Craig: 下面让我们来聊聊运动
Craig: Now, let's talk about sports

453
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:45,112
运动通过积极的方式让人们聚在一起
Sports can bring people together in meaningful ways

454
00:25:45,145 --> 00:25:47,447
无论是朋友间的激烈竞争
whether a heated rivalry among friends

455
00:25:47,481 --> 00:25:49,950
还是整个城市为当地队伍加油打气
or a whole town rooting for their team

456
00:25:49,983 --> 00:25:55,222
在 Apple 我们希望能为世界各地的体育迷们打造精彩的体验
And at Apple, we want to create great experiences for sports fans everywhere

457
00:25:55,255 --> 00:25:58,292

465
00:26:23,817 --> 00:26:27,821
我们最近还在 Apple TV+ 上首播 Friday Night Baseball
We also recently premiered Friday Night Baseball on Apple TV+

466
00:26:27,855 --> 00:26:31,158
这样你可以每周五观看两场精彩赛事
where you can stream two great games every Friday

467
00:26:31,191 --> 00:26:36,530
今天我们也为 Apple News 中的运动板块带来重大更新
And today, we have another major update for sports in Apple News

468
00:26:36,563 --> 00:26:40,133
Apple News 在其提供服务的各个市场问鼎新闻类 app
Apple News is the number one news app everywhere it's available

469
00:26:40,167 --> 00:26:43,337
现在将更让体育迷们有所期待
and it's about to become amazing for sports fans

470
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:46,139
你可以关注自己喜爱的运动队和比赛联盟
You can now follow your favorite teams and leagues to get stories

471
00:26:46,173 --> 00:26:48,976
获取来自上百家优质媒体发布的新闻报道

这都将通过全新的 My Sports 板块

00:26:52,646 --> 00:26:58,385
你也可以查看顶级职业和大学体育联赛的比分、赛程、排名

474
00:26:58,418 --> 00:27:00,654

476
00:27:05,692 --> 00:27:09,162

477
00:27:09,196 --> 00:27:11,832

00:27:29,283 --> 00:27:33,787
Craig: iOS 和整个 Apple 生态系统为全家带来了诸多精彩体验
Craig: iOS and the entire Apple ecosystem are amazing for families

484
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:36,490
我们今天将聊聊一些重要的新功能
and we have some great new features to talk about

485
00:27:36,523 --> 00:27:39,860
先从家人共享的一些更新开始
starting with some updates to Family Sharing

486
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:43,564
通过家人共享你可以将喜爱的购买和订阅的服务
With Family Sharing, you can share your favorite purchases

487
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:45,532
共享给最多五位家庭成员
and subscriptions with up to five of your family members

488
00:27:45,566 --> 00:27:50,771
包括 Apple Music iCloud+、Apple One 等等
including Apple Music, iCloud+, Apple One, and much more

489
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:54,675
这样家里每个人可以个性化定制自己喜爱的内容
Everyone gets personalized access to their favorite content

490
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:56,844
不需要再自己购买订阅
without having to buy their own subscriptions or share an account

491
00:27:56,877 --> 00:27:57,911
或是和其他人共用一个账户

492
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:02,316
有孩子的家庭可以为小朋友创建专属的儿童账户
And for households with kids, you can create accounts just for them

493
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:06,220
内置了家长控制来帮你监督他们的屏幕使用时间
with built-in parental controls to help you monitor their screen time

494
00:28:06,253 --> 00:28:07,788
或批准他们的购买
or approve their purchases

495
00:28:07,821 --> 00:28:12,226
今年我们将进一步简化创建儿童账户的过程
And this year, we're making it even easier to create accounts for kids

496
00:28:12,259 --> 00:28:16,897
以确保恰当的家长控制从一开始就实施起来
and make sure the right parental controls are in place right from the start

497
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:20,133
我们也将增加新方式便于设置年龄限制
We're adding a new, easy way to set age-appropriate restrictions

498
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,504
应用于各类 app、视频、书籍和音乐等
for apps, movies, books, and music

499
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,773
还有其他一些重要家长控制的快速设置
Along with quick setup of other important parental controls

500
00:28:26,807 --> 00:28:32,112
给孩子设置新设备比如 iPad 将变得更加容易
We're also making setting up a new device for your child–

462
00:28:29,877 --> 00:28:32,112
like an iPad–really simple

501
00:28:32,145 --> 00:28:35,682
新设备开机后只需移近你的 iPhone
Just turn on the device they'll be using, bring your iPhone nearby

502
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:38,585
选择快速开始进行设置
and choose to set up with Quick Start

503
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:41,822
轻点几下小朋友的新设备就设置好可以用了
With just a few taps, the new device will be set up for their use

504
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:46,460
并且已经设好了你选择的家长控制
with all the parental controls you've selected already configured

505
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,629
当你的孩子要求更多屏幕使用时间的时候
And when your child asks for more screen time

506
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:52,299
你也不需要转到设置中去同意或不同意他们的要求
you won't have to navigate to Settings to approve or deny their request

507
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:55,068
直接在信息 app 回复就可以了
You can now respond right in Messages

508
00:28:55,102 --> 00:28:58,405
最后我们还新增了家人共享核对清单
Finally, we've added a new Family Checklist with helpful tips

509
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,773
提供非常有帮助的提示

510
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:02,609
比如孩子长大了更新设置
like updating a child's settings as they get older

511
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:04,444
开启共享位置
turning on location sharing

512
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:09,149
或者就是提醒你可以与大家共享你的 iCloud+ 订阅
or just reminding you that you can share your iCloud+ subscription with everyone

513
00:29:09,183 --> 00:29:14,655
这就是今年有关家人共享的一些功能更新
So those are some of the helpful updates to Family Sharing this year

514
00:29:14,688 --> 00:29:21,028
我们知道大家都很喜欢与家人分享照片
Now, as we all know, one of the things

476
00:29:17,591 --> 00:29:21,028
everyone enjoys sharing with their family is photos

515
00:29:21,061 --> 00:29:25,899
所以今年我们优化了与家人共享照片的方式
So this year, we're introducing a better way to share photos with your family

516
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:29,503
我们珍贵的回忆一般可能是由不同的人拍下的
Our precious memories are often captured by several people

517
00:29:29,536 --> 00:29:34,208
包括个人照片中的兴趣爱好、家庭项目和课业等
and in between personal photos of hobbies, house projects, and homework

518
00:29:34,241 --> 00:29:38,212
还有我们的个人设备上那些家里人的照片全家人都想要
we have photos on our device that everyone in the family would like to have

519
00:29:38,245 --> 00:29:39,713
但当然没有人会有所有的照片
But no one has all of them

520
00:29:39,746 --> 00:29:42,783
所以家庭回忆永远没办法包含所有一切
so the family's memories are never complete

521
00:29:42,816 --> 00:29:44,084
现在呢
Until now

522
00:29:44,117 --> 00:29:47,421
我们带来了 iCloud 共享图库
We're introducing iCloud Shared Photo Library

523
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:51,158
帮助你顺利甚至自动与家人分享照片
to help you share photos seamlessly and even automatically

524
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:52,559
这很容易设置
It's easy to set up

525
00:29:52,593 --> 00:29:54,294
它是一个单独的 iCloud 图库
It's a separate iCloud library that everyone can contribute to

526
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:58,232
家里每个人都可以上传、协作和浏览
collaborate on, and enjoy

527
00:29:58,265 --> 00:30:00,200
你可以加入的共享图库
You can participate in one shared library

528
00:30:00,234 --> 00:30:02,636
最多可以和 5 个人共享
that's shared with up to five other people

529
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:05,939
操作非常简单且只会共享你希望从自己图库中分享出去的照片
We've made it simple to share just the photos you want from your library

530
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:08,809
你可以分享图库里所有照片
You can share everything already in your library

531
00:30:08,842 --> 00:30:12,980
或根据一个开始日期或照片里的人物进行筛选
or choose what to include based on a start date or the people in the photos

532
00:30:13,013 --> 00:30:18,418
举例说你可以选择共享只有你与伴侣和孩子的照片
For example, you can choose to include just the photos

495
00:30:15,716 --> 00:30:18,418
where you were together with your partner and the kids

533
00:30:18,452 --> 00:30:20,320
共享图库设置好后
Once the Shared Library is set up

534
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:23,857
你也可以手动将刚拍下的照片转移过去
you can manually move over new photos after you take them

535
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,893
但我们还想更方便些
But we wanted to make it even easier with a new switch right in Camera

536
00:30:25,926 --> 00:30:27,861
通过相机 app 里的一个新切换键

537
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:31,632
就可以在拍照的同时直接把照片发送到共享图库里
that sends shots straight to the Shared Library as you take them

538
00:30:31,665 --> 00:30:37,504
这非常适用于度假旅行时可以即时共享照片
This is great when you're on a vacation and you want to make sure

501
00:30:34,902 --> 00:30:37,504
the photos are shared right away

539
00:30:37,538 --> 00:30:40,240
而当你在拍摄个人物品如一份礼物时
And if you take a photo of something personal, like a gift

540
00:30:40,274 --> 00:30:42,142
也可随手关掉共享
you can easily turn it off

541
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:45,846
你甚至可以设置自动激活共享功能
You can also choose to have the sharing switch enabled automatically

542
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:49,783
这样你在共享图库的成员在附近拍照时就会启动
whenever you take shots with other members of the Shared Library nearby

543
00:30:49,816 --> 00:30:51,985
这样如果你和家人去露营的话
So if you take photos on a camping trip, you don't have to remember

544
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,688
就不用担心忘记分享照片了
to share them later

545
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:59,059
在为你推荐标签页里会智能地提供共享建议
You'll also receive intelligent sharing suggestions in the For You tab

546
00:30:59,092 --> 00:31:00,727
每人都有同样的权限
Everyone has equal permissions for adding, editing

547
00:31:00,761 --> 00:31:04,331
在共享图库添加、编辑和删除照片
and deleting photos in the Shared Library

548
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:07,167
所以如果有家庭成员很会编辑照片
So if one member of the group is a talented photo editor

549
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,337
大家就可以欣赏编辑好的共享照片了
everyone gets to enjoy their edits to the shared photos

550
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,073
删除、标题和关键词也都是同步的
Deletions, captions, and keywords sync too

551
00:31:13,106 --> 00:31:16,210
共享图库的内容会出现在所有人照片 app 的
Content in the Shared Library will appear in everyone's Memories

552
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:19,646
回忆、精选照片和小组件里
Featured Photos, and in the Photos widget

553
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:23,851
这样当你重温家庭之旅时所有的照片都会包含其中
So you can relive your family's adventures that include all the photos

554
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,954
这就是 iCloud 共享图库
That's iCloud Shared Photo Library:

555
00:31:26,987 --> 00:31:29,690
与家人共享照片的最佳方法
the best way to share photos with your family

556
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:33,360
最后我们来聊聊隐私
And last, let's talk about privacy

557
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,798
我们一直致力于保护用户及其隐私
We're always working hard to protect our users and their privacy

558
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:41,969
提供了 App 隐私报告、邮件隐私保护
with features like App Privacy Report, Mail Privacy Protection

559
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:47,107
App 跟踪透明度、隐私标签等功能
App Tracking Transparency, Privacy Nutrition Labels

523
00:31:45,372 --> 00:31:47,107
and so many more

560
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:52,079
另一个至关重要的点是保护用户的个人安全
Another critically important area is protecting our users' personal safety

561
00:31:52,112 --> 00:31:54,681
我们正在开发一个新工具
One way we're doing that is by adding a new tool

562
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:57,451
帮助大家快速关闭其他人的访问权限
to help people quickly turn off others' access

563
00:31:57,484 --> 00:32:02,222
比如有人想逃离一段虐待关系时可以停止位置共享
for example, disabling location sharing if they're escaping an abusive relationship

564
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,358
这就是安全检查功能
It's called Safety Check

565
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:06,660
下面请 Katie 来详细介绍
To tell you about it, here's Katie

566
00:32:10,397 --> 00:32:14,902
Katie Skinner: 有很多人都和自己的伴侣共享他们设备的密码和访问权限
Katie Skinner: Many people share passwords

531
00:32:12,299 --> 00:32:14,902
and access to their devices with their partner

567
00:32:14,935 --> 00:32:17,538
然而若是处于虐待关系
However, in abusive relationships, this can threaten personal safety

568
00:32:17,571 --> 00:32:19,273
这可能威胁到受害者个人安全

569
00:32:19,306 --> 00:32:22,376
也阻碍他们求助
and make it harder for victims to get help

570
00:32:22,409 --> 00:32:28,949
我们正和各类向家庭和亲密伴侣暴力的受害者提供帮助的组织密切合作
We've been working closely with organizations

535
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:28,949
that support victims of domestic and intimate partner violence

571
00:32:28,982 --> 00:32:32,953
其中一项合作成果就是安全检查
And the result of those conversations is Safety Check

572
00:32:32,986 --> 00:32:34,755
这是设置的新部分
a new section in Settings where you can quickly review and reset the access

573
00:32:34,788 --> 00:32:39,159
让你可以快速查看和重置之前授予他人的访问权限
you've granted others

574
00:32:39,193 --> 00:32:45,966
这样虐待关系受害者就可以快速撤销施暴人访问其数据和位置的权限
This lets people in abusive situations quickly revoke an abuser's access

540
00:32:44,398 --> 00:32:45,966
to their data and location

575
00:32:45,999 --> 00:32:49,803
以切断联系逃至安全之所
enabling them to cut ties and get to safety

576
00:32:49,837 --> 00:32:54,308
安全检查可以阻止你的设备通过查找网络将位置共享给他人
Safety Check stops sharing your location with others via FindMy

577
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:59,079
并重置所有 app 的系统隐私权限
and resets the system privacy permissions for all apps

578
00:32:59,112 --> 00:33:01,782
为了确保他人无法读取你的信息
It also protects access to your messages by helping you sign out of iCloud

579
00:33:01,815 --> 00:33:05,953
它也能帮你退出所有其他设备上的 iCloud
on all your other devices

580
00:33:05,986 --> 00:33:09,356
并将信息 app 和 FaceTime 通话的权限限制在手中的设备
and restricts Messages and FaceTime to the device in your hand

581
00:33:10,791 --> 00:33:14,761
安全检查也能帮你来管理什么权限授予给什么人过
Safety Check also helps you manage who you've given access to

582
00:33:14,795 --> 00:33:18,498
也能检查你给过哪些 app 什么样的权限
And you can audit which permissions you've granted to certain apps

583
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:22,202
我们的新举措得到了一些积极反馈
We've received some really positive feedback on our approach

584
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:25,005
包括美国 National Center for Victims of Crime
including from the National Center for Victims of Crime

585
00:33:25,038 --> 00:33:25,906
也对此评论：
who said: "In times of crisis, for many survivors

586
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:32,646
“在危急时刻受害者如果知道谁掌握他们的信息和位置这无疑是至关重要的”
"it's important to know who has their information and location

587
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:36,216
“安全检查将控制权交还给受害者了“
Safety Check helps give control back to survivors."

588
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,252
这是很重要的工作
This is important work

589
00:33:38,285 --> 00:33:42,256
让 iOS 进一步保护你的安全
expanding the ways iOS helps you stay safe

590
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:44,992
交回给你 Craig
Now, back to you, Craig

591
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,094
Craig: 保护你以及你的隐私
Craig: Protecting you and your privacy is and will always be

592
00:33:47,127 --> 00:33:51,465
一直以来都是我们所做的核心
at the center of what we do

593
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:57,738
iOS 16 带来了那么多的更新将会改变你的 iPhone 体验
iOS 16 offers so many updates that will change the way you experience iPhone

594
00:33:57,771 --> 00:34:00,741
iOS 还把这体验延伸到 iPhone 之外
iOS also extends that experience beyond the phone

595
00:34:00,774 --> 00:34:03,877
提升你与周遭世界的互动体验
to enhance how you interact with the world around you

596
00:34:03,911 --> 00:34:06,313
无论是优化你的晨间习惯
Whether helping you through your morning routine

597
00:34:06,346 --> 00:34:08,982
还是在你下一个公路旅行帮你保持在线
or keeping you connected on your next road trip

598
00:34:09,016 --> 00:34:11,552
都包在 iOS 身上
iOS has you covered

599
00:34:11,585 --> 00:34:16,290
今年我们给你的家居和汽车体验带来了令人期待的功能更新
This year we're bringing exciting updates to your home and your car

600
00:34:16,323 --> 00:34:19,560
有请 Corey 来给你谈谈家庭 app 的新功能
To tell you what's new in the home, here's Corey

601
00:34:19,593 --> 00:34:26,600
♪♪
♪♪

602
00:34:31,672 --> 00:34:34,708
Corey Wang: 我们的家也许就是生活中最重要的地方
Corey Wang: Our home is perhaps the most important place in our lives

603
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:36,710
并且要管理的东西有很多
and there's a lot to manage

604
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:38,212
有了智能家居配件
Smart home accessories can make it easier

605
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:42,382
这就方便多了你可以直接通过 iPhone 管理你的家
and more convenient to control your home right from your iPhone

606
00:34:42,416 --> 00:34:45,853
在办公桌边工作时查看谁在你家门口
You can do things like see who's at the door while working at your desk

607
00:34:45,886 --> 00:34:49,489
或者不用下床就关掉楼下的灯
or turn off the lights downstairs without getting out of bed

608
00:34:49,523 --> 00:34:50,924
不在家时
And when you're away from home

609
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:53,160
你也可以确认是否把前门上锁了
you can double-check if the front door is locked

610
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:54,361
或者提前调好温控
or adjust the temperature so it's just right when you get back

611
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:57,164
这样回到家时室内温度是刚好的

612
00:34:57,197 --> 00:34:59,233
你的家还可以变得更智能
And your smart home is all the more powerful

613
00:34:59,266 --> 00:35:01,001
尤其如果所有的配件能协同工作
when your accessories work together, reacting to changes automatically

614
00:35:01,034 --> 00:35:03,704
自动应对各种变化

615
00:35:03,737 --> 00:35:06,006
当然智能家居仍处于早期阶段
Now, the smart home is still in its early days

616
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:08,575
我们希望推动这些强大的功能
and we want to help bring these powerful experiences

617
00:35:08,609 --> 00:35:10,511
带到尽可能多的家里
to as many homes as possible

618
00:35:11,278 --> 00:35:14,147
要在家里建立一个连续互通的生态系统
In order to build a connected ecosystem at home

619
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:16,617
很重要的一点是你有各种选择
it's important that you have the most choice

620
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:19,253
而不必担心配件之间能否相互协作
so you don't have to worry about what works with what

621
00:35:19,286 --> 00:35:20,687
考虑到这点
With that in mind, we joined forces with other industry leaders

622
00:35:20,721 --> 00:35:23,056
我们和其他主流的业内伙伴一起

623
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:25,792
创立一个新的智能家居连接性标准
to create a new smart home connectivity standard

624
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:27,794
那就是 Matter
It's called Matter

625
00:35:27,828 --> 00:35:32,533
Matter 让智能家居配件可以跨平台协同操作
Matter enables smart home accessories to work together across platforms

626
00:35:32,566 --> 00:35:34,968
同时确保我们始终坚守的价值观
And to ensure we stayed true to our values

627
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:37,905
我们贡献了自己的智能家居体系 HomeKit
we contributed HomeKit, our smart home framework

628
00:35:37,938 --> 00:35:40,374
作为新标准的基础
as a foundation of this new standard

629
00:35:40,407 --> 00:35:42,576
这是为了确保 Matter 是建立在相同的核心原则上
so it's built on the same core principles

630
00:35:42,609 --> 00:35:45,712
并保持最高级别的安全性
and maintains the highest level of security

631
00:35:45,746 --> 00:35:48,882
业界的各大品牌都已陆续投入支持 Matter
Industry-leading brands have already committed to supporting Matter

632
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:51,518
有 130 多种产品正在生产计划中
with over 130 products in the pipeline, and that's just the beginning

633
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:53,754
而这只是开始

634
00:35:53,787 --> 00:35:58,525
Matter 标准提供了连接智能家居配件的基石
The Matter standard provides the underlying foundation

635
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:01,495
也让我们得以在此基础上进行创新
to connect smart home accessories, and it allows us to innovate on top of it

636
00:36:01,528 --> 00:36:02,796
我们进一步加强了隐私保护
We take privacy further

637
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:07,968
确保默认状态下你使用配件的数据都得以安全处理与储存
ensuring that data about how you use your accessories is processed

638
00:36:08,001 --> 00:36:10,804
就连 Apple 本身也无法访问
and stored by default in a way that even Apple can't see

639
00:36:10,838 --> 00:36:14,508
基于 Matter 我们将持续通过家庭 app 打造精彩的体验
With Matter, we can continue to create amazing experiences in the Home app

640
00:36:14,541 --> 00:36:17,277
同时也确保所有各种配件

让我们看看全新的家庭 app 如何让你的体验变得更棒
let's check out how we made the experience even better

606
00:36:25,886 --> 00:36:27,754
with an all-new Home app

644
00:36:27,788 --> 00:36:32,059
我们从底层架构开始进行了彻底的重新设计
We reimagined it from the ground up starting with the underlying architecture

645
00:36:32,092 --> 00:36:34,228
让它更有效可靠
so it's more efficient and reliable

646
00:36:34,261 --> 00:36:37,264
这对拥有许多配件的家来说尤其重要
especially for homes with many accessories

647
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:43,003
我们也彻底重新设计了你浏览、组织、查看各个配件的方式
We also completely redesigned how you navigate, organize

648
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:45,639
以更轻松地掌控你的智能家居
and view accessories to make it easier to control your smart home

649
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:49,109
我们将所有的房间和收藏项都整合进家庭 app 的首页
We've integrated your rooms and favorites into the main tab of the app

650
00:36:49,142 --> 00:36:52,479
这样你可以一览无余整个家的情况
So you can see your entire home in a single view

651
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,981
使其看上去美观整洁
And we made sure it looks great, whether you're just getting started

652
00:36:54,014 --> 00:36:55,482
不论你是智能家居的新手

653
00:36:55,516 --> 00:36:58,318
还是搭建了整个先进且相互联通的家
or have built out an advanced connected home

654
00:36:58,352 --> 00:37:03,390
我们还增加了温控、灯光、安全等新类别
We added new categories for climate, lights, security, and more

655
00:37:03,423 --> 00:37:07,794
并在屏幕顶部添加了每个类别情况的概览
and an overview of what's happening in each category

618
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,794
right at the top of the screen

656
00:37:07,828 --> 00:37:11,398
通过类别还可以轻松浏览家庭 app
And categories are a great way to navigate within the app

657
00:37:11,431 --> 00:37:13,734
当你轻点一个特定类别
When you tap on a specific category, you see all the relevant accessories

658
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:17,004
就可以按房间查看所有有关配件

659
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:20,007
以及更详细的状态信息
organized by room and more detailed status information

660
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,511
中心位置则是多摄像头视图可一次查看四个
A multi-camera view displays up to four cameras at once front and center

661
00:37:24,545 --> 00:37:27,514
右扫既能查看其他额外的摄像头
and you can scroll to the right to see any additional cameras

662
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:29,550
我们也重新设计了每个模块
We also redesigned tiles so that different accessories

663
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:33,987
让你能通过形状和颜色轻易识别不同的配件
are more visually recognizable through shape and color

664
00:37:34,021 --> 00:37:36,023
现在有了新的锁定屏幕上的小组件
And with the new widgets on the Lock Screen, it's easier than ever

665
00:37:36,056 --> 00:37:38,825
要查看你的智能家居情况也就更方便了
to see how your home is doing

666
00:37:38,859 --> 00:37:41,128
这就是全新的家庭 app
So that's the all-new Home app, and it's coming to iPhone, iPad, and Mac

667
00:37:41,161 --> 00:37:43,997
很快也将在 iPhone、 iPad 和 Mac 推出

668
00:37:44,031 --> 00:37:47,067
现在你有了掌控家居的工具
Now that you have what you need to keep tabs on your home

669
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,635
可以准备上车出发了
you're ready to hit the road

670
00:37:48,669 --> 00:37:51,505
让我们交给 Emily 来给你介绍 CarPlay 车载

Emily Schubert: CarPlay is the smarter, safer way to use your iPhone in the car

672
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:02,850
也从根本上改变了人们和汽车的交互方式
and has fundamentally changed the way people interact with their vehicles

673
00:38:02,883 --> 00:38:07,020
几乎全美 98% 的汽车都可以使用
It's available on over 98% of cars in the U.S

676
00:38:14,428 --> 00:38:18,365
这是买新车时必有的功能
It's a must-have feature when shopping for a new vehicle

677
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:20,701
我们的用户非常喜爱 CarPlay 车载

00:38:20,734 --> 00:38:27,040
它让用户可以非常便捷地在车中使用各类 app 同时采用他们所熟悉的 iPhone 交互界面
It gives them an easy way to use apps in the car

640
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:27,040
using the familiar UI from their iPhone

00:38:27,074 --> 00:38:28,976
但汽车也经历了很大的变化
But cars have changed a lot

680
00:38:29,009 --> 00:38:30,944
比如屏幕尺寸变大了
with larger-sized screens and more of them throughout the car

681
00:38:30,978 --> 00:38:33,080
也有更多屏幕分布全车

682
00:38:33,113 --> 00:38:39,019
iPhone 也因此有机会扮演更重要的角色
There's an opportunity for iPhone to play an even more important role

683
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:41,221
我们正与汽车制造商们合作
We've been working with automakers to reinvent the in-car experience

684
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:46,960
携手重塑各类车内屏幕的体验

00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:44,358
你可以轻点显示屏让它们跳动
You can tap the display to send them bouncing around

761
00:43:44,391 --> 00:43:47,361
在你放下手腕后它们也就会休息一下
and when you lower your wrist, they take a nap

762
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:51,865
最后大都会表盘以新字型突显手表的风格
Finally, Metropolitan highlights watch typography with a new font

763
00:43:51,899 --> 00:43:55,135
当你旋转数码表冠时字型也会随着动态拉伸

769
00:44:16,256 --> 00:44:19,826
另一个保持联系的方式就是收听最新的故事
Another way to stay connected is by listening to the latest stories

770
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,962
或者分享你喜欢的内容

对于开发者们来说
For developers, sharing content and selected images from apps like Outcast

775
00:44:35,175 --> 00:44:40,914
从 Outcast 或者微信等 app 分享内容和共享已选择图片将更容易

776
00:44:40,948 --> 00:44:43,717
这得益于新的共享表单和照片选择器 API

And now to Craig to tell you what's coming to keep you active

782
00:45:02,936 --> 00:45:05,672
Craig Bolton: 体能训练 app 是最受欢迎的 app 之一
Craig Bolton: The Workout app is one of the most popular apps

783
00:45:05,706 --> 00:45:07,541
所以这次的 watchOS 9
so in watchOS 9, we're bringing new easy-to-use metrics

784
00:45:07,574 --> 00:45:11,812
推出了一系列全新且易用的指标、视图和训练体验

785
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:14,982
得益于顶级的运动员们提供的灵感启发
views, and training experiences inspired by high-performing athletes

786
00:45:15,015 --> 00:45:17,050
先从跑步说起
starting with running

787
00:45:17,084 --> 00:45:19,753
这项运动不管你的水平如何
It's a sport that, no matter what your level

788
00:45:19,786 --> 00:45:23,190
都可以使用指标更好了解你的表现
you can use metrics to better understand your performance

789
00:45:23,223 --> 00:45:27,661
相应地调整训练也能减少受伤机率
And switching up your training can reduce the chance of getting injured

790
00:45:27,694 --> 00:45:32,633
我们首先添加了三项新的跑姿测量指标
The first thing we're doing is adding three new running form metrics

791
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:35,068
以追踪你跑步的效率
to track how efficiently you run

792
00:45:35,102 --> 00:45:38,005
但要从手腕测量这些并不简单
Measuring these from the wrist isn't easy

793
00:45:38,038 --> 00:45:40,440
比如垂直振幅
Take vertical oscillation for example

794
00:45:40,474 --> 00:45:44,044
是衡量你上下移动幅度的指标
which is a measure of how much you move up and down

795
00:45:44,077 --> 00:45:45,512
如果幅度过高
If it's too high, your energy might be wasted going up

796
00:45:45,546 --> 00:45:50,117
代表你消耗太多能量往上移而不是往前推进
versus propelling you forward

797
00:45:50,150 --> 00:45:52,085
要从手腕测量这个
In order to capture this from the wrist

798
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:57,491
我们必须从你手臂摆动的独特性推测你的躯干运动
we need to extrapolate your torso movement

757
00:45:54,588 --> 00:45:57,491
from the distinctive style of your arm swing

799
00:45:57,524 --> 00:46:00,627
我们使用了机器学习和传感器融合
We use machine learning and sensor fusion–

800
00:46:00,661 --> 00:46:03,730
也就是加速感应器和陀螺仪的组合
a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope–

801
00:46:03,764 --> 00:46:05,866
将躯干运动分离出来
to isolate your torso movement

802
00:46:05,899 --> 00:46:09,469
再测量其产生的垂直振幅
and then measure how much vertical oscillation is produced

803
00:46:09,503 --> 00:46:14,208
我们也用类似方法来测量另外两个跑姿测量指标
We use a similar approach to measure the two other Running Form metrics–

804
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:17,811
步长和触地时间
stride length and ground contact time

805
00:46:17,845 --> 00:46:22,382
这些指标可以被添加到全新且易于查看的体能训练视图
These metrics can be added to new easy-to-read Workout views

806
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:25,853
每个视图都有更多指标让你一目了然
Each Workout view lets you see more at a glance

807
00:46:25,886 --> 00:46:30,324
滚动数码表冠就可查看常见指标的新视图
Scroll the digital crown to see new views

767
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:31,425
for familiar metrics like segments

808
00:46:30,357 --> 00:46:34,027
如分段、单段和爬升高度
splits, and elevation

809
00:46:34,061 --> 00:46:36,830
新推出的还有心率区间
And we're introducing heart rate zones

810
00:46:36,864 --> 00:46:39,233
便于你快速查看自己所处的区间
so you can quickly see what zone you're in

811
00:46:39,266 --> 00:46:44,004
随时了解自己的训练强度
and get a sense of your intensity level at any point during your workout

812
00:46:44,037 --> 00:46:46,373
同时还有新的自定义训练计划
There's also a new custom workout

813
00:46:46,406 --> 00:46:49,076
让你规划自己的跑步训练
that you can use to add structure into your run

814
00:46:49,109 --> 00:46:53,280
举个例子如果你是想提高速度或耐力
For example, if you are trying to improve your speed or endurance

815
00:46:53,313 --> 00:46:59,152
就可以基于距离和时间段来创建一套训练与恢复计划
you can create a workout using distance and time intervals

816
00:46:59,186 --> 00:47:01,221
让你可以重复进行
that include sets of work and recovery which you can repeat as needed

817
00:47:01,255 --> 00:47:06,026
你还可以在训练的指定部分添加一些新提示
You can also add one of the new alerts to a specific part of your workout–

818
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:09,062
比如专门用来提醒你的心率区间目标
like one to monitor which heart rate zone you want to train in

819
00:47:09,096 --> 00:47:11,231
帮助你保持在训练目标上
to help keep you on track

820
00:47:11,265 --> 00:47:16,837
当你跑步时这些提示可以通过触觉和声音反馈指引你
During your run, these alerts will guide you

781
00:47:14,234 --> 00:47:16,837
with both haptics and voice feedback

821
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:20,607
让你知道何时在训练和恢复间进行切换
letting you know when to switch between work and recovery

822
00:47:20,641 --> 00:47:26,547
或者提醒你加速如果你的心率低于目标区间时
and when to pick up the pace if your heart rate falls below

784
00:47:24,578 --> 00:47:26,547
the target zone that you set

823
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:29,550
跑步时你也可以使用数码表冠
During your run, you can use the Digital Crown

824
00:47:29,583 --> 00:47:31,318
查看其他的训练视图
for additional workout views like this new power metric

825
00:47:31,351 --> 00:47:33,587
比如这个新的功率指标

826
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:35,556
设定功率目标的话
Running with a power target can help you go the distance

827
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:41,295
可以帮助确保能量消耗在可持续的范围内让你跑得更远
by keeping your effort in a range that you can reasonably sustain

828
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:45,666
你甚至还可以查看你的体能训练对健身记录圆环的贡献
You can even see how this workout is contributing to your Activity rings

829
00:47:45,699 --> 00:47:47,201
而且如果你经常使用一个跑步路线
And if it's a route you do often, it will be automatically saved

830
00:47:47,234 --> 00:47:50,437
你的体能训练 app 会将其自动保存起来

831
00:47:50,470 --> 00:47:53,607
让你可以和自己上次或最佳时间进行赛跑

832
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:57,778
来了解自己坚持锻炼的成效如何
That way, you can see if all the training you're doing is paying off

833
00:47:57,811 --> 00:48:01,348
这么多新的功能也不仅用于跑步
You can use many of these new features not just when you're running

834
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,183
也可用于其他类型

And as you sleep, you're likely to cycle through these stages multiple times

871
00:50:22,789 --> 00:50:26,627
学者们还在研究睡眠时所发生的事情
Researchers are still looking into what happens during sleep

872
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:28,562
及其它对健康的影响

而在健康 app
And in the Health app, you can manage lifestyle factors

888
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:25,052
你也可以管理数个可能影响你房颤时长的生活因素

And this year, we're tackling another integral aspect of health

899
00:52:02,456 --> 00:52:04,458
用药

00:52:04,491 --> 00:52:07,895
超过 50% 的人群在服用各类处方药
Over 50% of people take prescription medications

00:52:14,001 --> 00:52:18,105
所以 watchOS 9 里的用药 app 将帮你
So in watchOS 9, the Medications app makes it easy for you to discreetly

904
00:52:18,138 --> 00:52:25,045

vitamins, and supplements anytime

905
00:52:25,078 --> 00:52:27,814
你可以记录偶尔的用药
You can log medications that you might take occasionally

906
00:52:27,848 --> 00:52:30,050
比如抗过敏的西替利嗪
like Cetirizine for allergies

907
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:35,088
也可以收到通知提醒你定期用药
And you can receive notifications for medications

872
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,088
that you need to take regularly

908
00:52:35,122 --> 00:52:39,493
表盘上丰富的复杂功能也能帮你时刻掌握用药时间
Rich complications on your watch face can help you stay on top of your schedule

909
00:52:39,526 --> 00:52:44,198
当然你也能从健康 app 追踪与管理用药
And of course you can track and manage your medications in the Health app

910
00:52:44,231 --> 00:52:47,067
就算你没有 Apple Watch 也可以
even if you don't have an Apple Watch

911
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:48,969
要创建你的用药清单
To build your medications list

912
00:52:49,002 --> 00:52:52,673
只需将输入药名就会出现用药建议
start typing the name, and you'll see suggestions

913
00:52:52,706 --> 00:52:54,975
我们希望能简化这个过程
We wanted to make creating the list easier

914
00:52:55,008 --> 00:52:58,312
尤其如果你服用多种药物
especially if you take multiple medications

915
00:52:58,345 --> 00:53:03,550
所以你只需使用 iPhone 相机扫描药物标签即可
So you can just use your iPhone camera to scan the label of your medication

916
00:53:03,584 --> 00:53:05,986
你也可以制定时间表来接收提醒
You can create a schedule to receive reminders

917
00:53:06,019 --> 00:53:10,390
还能添加自定义视觉效果帮你记得用药
and add custom visuals to make it easier to remember

918
00:53:10,424 --> 00:53:14,027
用药的另一个重要方面是药物间的相互作用
Another important aspect of medications is drug-drug interactions

919
00:53:14,061 --> 00:53:16,997
有时可能降低效果或者引起副作用
which can make them less effective or cause side effects

920
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:24,638
单在美国每年因药物相互作用而入院的人高达 25 万
In the U.S. alone, drug interactions cause nearly

886
00:53:20,834 --> 00:53:24,638
a quarter of a million hospitalizations each year

921
00:53:24,671 --> 00:53:25,906
为了帮你解决此问题
To help you with this, you'll receive an alert when you add a new medication

922
00:53:25,939 --> 00:53:30,611
每当你添加用药时如果会有危急的相互作用就会出现提示
if there is a critical interaction

923
00:53:30,644 --> 00:53:33,914
我们与顶级的医学出版社 Elsevier 合作
We've partnered with Elsevier, a leading medical publisher

924
00:53:33,947 --> 00:53:40,254
在用药 app 的各个环节提供临床准确且基于证据的信息

891
00:53:37,351 --> 00:53:40,254
across the Medications experience

00:53:40,287 --> 00:53:44,124
这样你就能够查看危急、严重或一般的相互作用
You'll be able to review critical, serious, and moderate interactions

926
00:53:44,157 --> 00:53:47,060
以及与酒精等的相互作用
as well as interaction factors like alcohol

927
00:53:47,094 --> 00:53:49,496
用药 app 也适用于健康共享
Medications also works with Health Sharing

928
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:52,065
这也是 iOS 16 的更新之一
which is updated in iOS 16

现在回到 Kevin
Now back to Kevin

934
00:54:08,182 --> 00:54:11,151
你的健康数据是你最私密的信息之一

935
00:54:11,185 --> 00:54:15,556
而隐私保护是我们打造 Apple Watch 和设计各项功能的核心

984
00:56:58,819 --> 00:57:01,455
并封装了超过 200 亿个晶体管
and features over 20 billion transistors:

985
00:57:01,488 --> 00:57:04,191
比 M1 芯片多了 25%
that's 25% more than M1

986
00:57:04,224 --> 00:57:07,828
我们用这些晶体管来增强芯片的每一个功能
We use those transistors to enhance every feature of the chip

987
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:09,696
首先是内存控制器
starting with the memory controller

988
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:14,001
它能提供 100GB/s 的统一内存带宽
which delivers 100GB/s of unified memory bandwidth

00:57:14,034 --> 00:57:18,372
这比 M1 芯片多了 50% 也带来了更高的性能
which is 50% more than M1 for even greater performance

990
00:57:18,405 --> 00:57:23,343
并且由于 M1 芯片功能强大用户可以运行各种对性能有高要求的任务
And because M1 is so capable, users run all sorts of demanding tasks

991
00:57:23,377 --> 00:57:28,148
所以在 M2 上我们启用了高达 24GB 的统一内存
So for M2, we've enabled up to 24GB of unified memory

992
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:31,552
来处理更巨大也更复杂的工作负载

Together, they rip through CPU-intensive tasks using very little power

999
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:56,476
如果我们把 M2 芯片的多核中央处理器性能与 M1 芯片相比较
When we look at the multi-core CPU performance of M2 compared to M1

1000
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,980
就能发现它的性能提升了 18%

which needs dramatically more power

1008
00:58:20,367 --> 00:58:22,135
需要大幅增加功耗才能提高性能
to deliver an increase in performance

1009
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:25,772
所以搭载 12 核 PC 笔记本电脑芯片的系统会变得更厚、更烫、更吵
So it's in a thicker, hotter, more noisy system

1010
00:58:25,806 --> 00:58:27,140
电池续航时间也更短
with less battery life

M2 芯片的图形处理器能在相同功耗下具有最快可达 2.3 倍的性能
the GPU in M2 delivers 2.3 times faster performance at the same power level

1024
00:59:11,818 --> 00:59:14,655
M2 芯片只需要五分之一的功耗
And M2 delivers the peak performance of the PC chip

1025
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:17,157
就能实现 PC 芯片的峰值性能
using just one-fifth of the power

1026
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:19,793
M2 芯片具有卓越的性能功耗比
This much higher performance per watt from M2

1231
01:11:32,326 --> 01:11:35,863
团队再次挤进了他们的小巴车沿着 1 号公路向南行驶
the team once again piled into their macOS naming microbus

1232
01:11:35,896 --> 01:11:39,032
继续着他们为 macOS 命名的旅程
and wove their way down Highway 1

1233
01:11:39,066 --> 01:11:42,936
追随着五彩缤纷的加州野花
Chasing the vibrant display of colorful California wildflowers

1234
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:45,405
他们终于在迷人的海浪
they finally came to rest

1235
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:48,442
与茂盛的冲积平原交汇处找到了休息之地
where stunning surf meets lush alluvial plains

1236
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:50,944
这就是美丽的 Ventura
in beautiful Ventura

1237
01:11:50,978 --> 01:11:55,048
macOS Ventura 让我们使用 Mac 的方式变得更丰富了
macOS Ventura enriches so many of the ways we use our Macs

1238
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:56,717
那么让我们仔细来了解一下
So let's jump in

1239
01:11:56,750 --> 01:12:01,855
Mac 体验的关键在于帮你变得更有生产力也更有创造力
A key part of the Mac experience is helping you be productive and creative

1240
01:12:01,889 --> 01:12:05,759
这也常常意味着你需要一次打开很多窗口
which can often mean having a lot of windows open at once

1241
01:12:05,792 --> 01:12:09,429
可当窗口越来越多时也会变得越来越应接不暇
And the more you do, the more overwhelming this can become

1242
01:12:09,463 --> 01:12:11,632
我们都想要达到一个完美的平衡
We all want the perfect mix–

1243
01:12:11,665 --> 01:12:14,301
既要专注于自己的工作不被分心
to focus on our work without distractions

1244
01:12:14,334 --> 01:12:17,204
又希望在各种任务之间轻松切换
and to easily move between tasks

1245
01:12:17,237 --> 01:12:22,042
今年我们有了一种能让一切都自动变得井井有条
This year, we have a new way to automatically keep everything organized

1246
01:12:22,075 --> 01:12:25,112
也能让你快速访问各个窗口的新方法
and give you quick access to your windows

1247
01:12:25,145 --> 01:12:27,848
这就是台前调度
It's called Stage Manager

1248
01:12:27,881 --> 01:12:29,483
我们来看看它是怎么发挥作用的
Let's see how it works

1249
01:12:30,617 --> 01:12:33,053
当你用 Mac 工作时常常会发现
When you're working on the Mac, it's really easy

1250
01:12:33,086 --> 01:12:36,089
自己同时打开了许多窗口
to find yourself with lots of open windows

1251
01:12:36,123 --> 01:12:39,726
Mac 有调度中心这样的优秀工具
Now, the Mac has great tools like Mission Control

1252
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:42,362
能帮你找到你需要的窗口
to help you find the window that you're looking for

1253
01:12:42,396 --> 01:12:44,097
但是有这么多打开的窗口
but with so many open windows

1254
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:47,334
可能会让工作区域不可避免地显得杂乱无章
it can feel like you never really escape all the clutter

1255
01:12:47,367 --> 01:12:51,138
有了台前调度你就可以心无旁骛地专注在你正在用的 app 上
With Stage Manager, you can focus on the app you're using

1256
01:12:51,171 --> 01:12:53,207
不会被分心了
without the distractions

1257
01:12:53,240 --> 01:12:55,309
而且它使用起来很简单
and it's easy to get started

1258
01:12:55,342 --> 01:12:59,813
现在让我们从控制中心启动台前调度
Let's activate Stage Manager from Control Center

1259
01:12:59,847 --> 01:13:04,618
你会看到它自动把我所有的窗口都排列在了屏幕一边
As you see, it automatically arranges all my windows for me off to the side

1260
01:13:04,651 --> 01:13:08,889
而台前调度把我正在使用的 app 放在了屏幕最前方的中间位置
and puts the app I'm currently working with front and center

1261
01:13:08,922 --> 01:13:10,624
当我点开新 app 的时候
When I bring forward a different app

1262
01:13:10,657 --> 01:13:13,594
比如我点击了程序坞里的邮件 app
like clicking on Mail here in the Dock

1263
01:13:13,627 --> 01:13:15,629
你就会看到邮件 app 在屏幕前方最中间的位置打开了
you'll see that it's brought to the stage

1264
01:13:15,662 --> 01:13:18,365
而 Safari 浏览器就被优雅地挪到左边
and Safari gracefully moves over to the left

1265
01:13:18,398 --> 01:13:20,267
与其他我近期使用过的 app 放在一起
with my other recent apps

1266
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,237
当我再次点击 Safari 浏览器的时候你可以看到它重新占据了舞台
When I click on Safari, it retakes the stage

1267
01:13:23,270 --> 01:13:25,205
而邮件 app 退到了左边
and Mail moves back to the left

1268
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:26,840
你会注意到
You'll notice that for an app with multiple open windows

1269
01:13:26,874 --> 01:13:30,377
在处理打开了许多窗口的 app 时比如这里的 Pages 文稿

1223
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:32,713
like Pages here, Stage Manager gathers all the windows together

1270
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:34,381
台前调度把这些窗口都聚集在了一起
in a single pile

1271
01:13:34,414 --> 01:13:36,750
只要点击一下最上面的窗口就会打开
When I click, I get the top one

1272
01:13:36,783 --> 01:13:37,985
如果我想打开别的窗口
and if I want a different window, I can cycle through them

1273
01:13:38,018 --> 01:13:41,555
也可以通过点击来让它们循环
just by clicking

1274
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,457
这真的是很方便
It's really convenient

1275
01:13:43,490 --> 01:13:46,360
当然就像你对 Mac 的设想一样
Of course, just as you would expect on a Mac

1276
01:13:46,393 --> 01:13:50,964
我也可以让窗口重叠放置并且同时打开许多个 app
I can have overlapping windows and multiple apps open at the same time too

1277
01:13:50,998 --> 01:13:53,400
把 app 组合在一起真的很容易
It's really easy to group apps together

1278
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:59,506
我只需要把备忘录拖过来和 Pages 文稿的窗口放在一起就可以了
Here I'll just drag in Notes and pair it with my Pages window

1279
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:02,142
当我工作需要用到一组 app 时
This is so great when I'm working on projects

1280
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:03,977
这样的功能就可以派上大用场了
that involve a specific group of windows

1281
01:14:04,011 --> 01:14:07,381
比如我用这 3 个 app 来计划一趟旅行
like planning a trip with these three apps here

1282
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:09,850
而当我回到我之前在用的一组 app 时
And if I go back to my previous group

1283
01:14:09,883 --> 01:14:12,553
台前调度依然保留了
Stage Manager keeps my windows arranged

1284
01:14:12,586 --> 01:14:14,454
所有窗口原本的顺序
just as I left them

1285
01:14:14,488 --> 01:14:16,089
我很喜欢这样的工作方式
I love working this way

1286
01:14:16,123 --> 01:14:18,192
当然就像许多 Mac 用户一样
Of course, like many Mac users

1287
01:14:18,225 --> 01:14:21,295
我会经常想要访问桌面上的文件
I often want to get at files on my desktop

1288
01:14:21,328 --> 01:14:25,165
有了台前调度这一切就变得都比之前更容易了
and with Stage Manager, we've made that easier than ever

1289
01:14:25,199 --> 01:14:27,167
我正在处理这个 Final Cut 项目
I'm working on this Final Cut project

1290
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,969
这时我想拖入几个文件
and I want to pull in a couple of files

1291
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:33,273
只要点击桌面我的窗口就会把桌面空出来
With just a click on my desktop, my windows clear the stage

1292
01:14:33,307 --> 01:14:34,942
而我的文件就会出现
and my files are revealed

1293
01:14:34,975 --> 01:14:38,312
这样我就可以选取这些标题图形
Now I can grab these title graphics

1294
01:14:38,345 --> 01:14:42,449
把它们拖拽到我的 Final Cut 窗口上
and drag them over to my Final Cut window

1295
01:14:42,482 --> 01:14:44,952
我只要把它们放在这里
I'll just drop them in right here

1296
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,720
就一切搞定
and boom

1297
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:51,992
这就是对使用台前调度进行多任务处理的简单介绍
So that's a quick look at multitasking with Stage Manager

1298
01:14:52,025 --> 01:14:56,630
Mac 体验中另一个能帮你完成更多工作的功能就是聚焦
Another part of the Mac experience that helps you do more is Spotlight

1299
01:14:56,663 --> 01:15:00,167
今年我们会发布这方面的重大更新它将为我们带来更加一致也更加强大的体验
This year we have a big update that delivers a more consistent

1300
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:03,337
并贯穿于各个平台
and powerful experience across our platforms

1301
01:15:03,370 --> 01:15:06,406
聚焦适用于各种各样的任务
Spotlight is great for doing all kinds of things

1302
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,476
比如可以用来快速打开 app 或者开始搜索等
like quickly launching an app or starting a search

1303
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:12,479
现在你可以通过快速查看来了解搜索结果
And now you can peek at a result in Quick Look

1304
01:15:12,513 --> 01:15:14,581
并且只需要轻按空格键就可以
with a tap on the space bar

1305
01:15:14,615 --> 01:15:16,617
聚焦现在也可以用来查找照片
Spotlight can now also find images from your photo library

1306
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:20,521
从你的照片图库整个系统以及网络上来查找
across the system, and on the web

1307
01:15:20,554 --> 01:15:24,791
使用实况文本你也可以搜索图片中的文字
And using Live Text, you can search the text inside the image

1308
01:15:24,825 --> 01:15:28,028
还可以直接通过聚焦启动计时器
You can also take actions like starting a timer

1309
01:15:28,061 --> 01:15:30,931
或者运行快捷方式等
or running a shortcut right from Spotlight

1310
01:15:30,964 --> 01:15:33,667
这也变成了获取信息的绝佳方式
It's also a great way to get information

1311
01:15:33,700 --> 01:15:37,671
现在它会利用整个窗口来展示更丰富的搜索结果
now leveraging the full window for richer results

1312
01:15:37,704 --> 01:15:42,242
搜索音乐人的时候你会看到他们的专辑关键信息、相关新闻以及其它信息
For musicians, you'll see their albums, key facts, news, and more

1313
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:45,746
聚焦也非常适合用来搜索电影电视节目和演员
It's also great for movies, TV shows, and actors

1314
01:15:45,779 --> 01:15:48,582
商家还有体育运动
businesses, and sports

1315
01:15:48,615 --> 01:15:51,985
直接从聚焦开展操作的功能和丰富的搜索结果
Rich results and the ability to take actions right from Spotlight

1316
01:15:52,019 --> 01:15:55,489
也将会出现在 iOS 和 iPadOS 上
are also coming to iOS and iPadOS

1317
01:15:55,522 --> 01:15:57,624
说到 iOS
Now, speaking of iOS, we wanted to make Spotlight even easier

1318
01:15:57,658 --> 01:16:01,628
我们想让访问聚焦更加容易
to discover and access

1319
01:16:01,662 --> 01:16:05,165
所以我们把它添加到了主屏幕的底部
so we added it right to the bottom of the Home Screen

1320
01:16:05,199 --> 01:16:08,502
只需要轻点一下你就可以用聚焦启动 app
With just a tap, you can use Spotlight to launch an app

1321
01:16:08,535 --> 01:16:11,338
查找联系人或者开始搜索
find a contact, or start a search

1322
01:16:11,371 --> 01:16:15,442
这些更新让聚焦更高效更快速地
These updates make Spotlight more productive

1323
01:16:15,475 --> 01:16:17,444
帮你找到需要的内容
helping you find what you're looking for faster

1324
01:16:17,477 --> 01:16:22,816
接下来让我们来聊一个我们很多人每天都会用来沟通交流的 app
Next, let's turn to an app that many of us use to communicate every day

1325
01:16:22,850 --> 01:16:25,519
让 Darin 来告诉你们更多
To take you through it, here's Darin

1326
01:16:27,821 --> 01:16:30,891
这个 app 当然是邮件 app
Darin Adler: Of course, we're talking about Mail

1327
01:16:30,924 --> 01:16:33,961
邮件 app 是我们中许多人交流沟通的核心方式
Mail is central to how so many of us communicate

1328
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:37,164
今年我们带来了许多能帮助你提高工作效率的重大更新
This year, we have great updates that will help you be more productive

1329
01:16:37,197 --> 01:16:39,666
首先就是一些被要求最多的功能
starting with some highly-requested features

1330
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:44,338
撤销发送可以让你在发送邮件之后的片刻还能撤回邮件
Undo send lets you pull an email back a few moments after hitting Send

1331
01:16:44,371 --> 01:16:48,609
定时发送能让你的邮件在最完美的时间到达收件人
Scheduled send, so your emails arrive at the perfect moment

1332
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:51,912
跟进建议会自动提醒你跟进这封邮件
Follow-up suggestions will automatically remind you to follow up

1333
01:16:51,945 --> 01:16:54,014
如果你的邮件没有收到回复
if you haven't received a response

1334
01:16:54,047 --> 01:16:57,117
稍后提醒我这个功能可以让你轻松回到相关的信件
And Remind Me makes it easy to come back to a message

1335
01:16:57,150 --> 01:16:59,019
在特定日期和时间
at a particular date and time

1336
01:16:59,052 --> 01:17:01,588
接下来我们来聊聊搜索功能
Next, let's talk Search

1337
01:17:01,622 --> 01:17:05,492
这是多年来我们对邮件 app 中的搜索功能做的最大一次改造
This is the biggest overhaul of Search in Mail we've done in years

1338
01:17:05,526 --> 01:17:07,995
我们利用了最新最先进的技术
leveraging the latest state-of-the-art techniques

1339
01:17:08,028 --> 01:17:10,430
来提供更准确更全面的结果
to deliver more accurate and complete results

1340
01:17:10,464 --> 01:17:11,932
点进搜索的时候
When you click Search, you'll see recently shared documents

1341
01:17:11,965 --> 01:17:16,103
你会看到最近分享的文件、链接等等
links, and more

1342
01:17:16,136 --> 01:17:17,471
开始打字之后
The moment you start typing

1343
01:17:17,504 --> 01:17:20,974
每打出一个字就能立即看到建议的结果
with each letter, you instantly see suggestions

1344
01:17:21,008 --> 01:17:23,744
如果你打错了字搜索也能比你更快一步
If you make a typo, Search is one step ahead

1345
01:17:23,777 --> 01:17:26,380
只显示正确拼写的结果
only showing results for the correct spelling

1346
01:17:26,413 --> 01:17:29,683
如果搜索发现了同义词它也会显示意义相同的结果
And if Search knows a synonym, it'll look for that too

1347
01:17:29,716 --> 01:17:34,855
这些新功能也会引入 iPadOS 和 iOS
And all these new features are also coming to iPadOS and iOS

1348
01:17:34,888 --> 01:17:36,823
这就是关于邮件 app 的更新
And that's Mail

1349
01:17:36,857 --> 01:17:41,328
接下来我们要介绍的是另外一个我们大多数人都会在上面花很久时间的 app
Next up is another app most of us spend a ton of time in every day:

1350
01:17:41,361 --> 01:17:42,729
Safari 浏览器

1368
01:18:38,952 --> 01:18:42,956
现在 Safari 浏览器还带来了能与其他人分享你最爱内容的新方法
And now Safari has a new way to share your favorite content with others

1369
01:18:42,990 --> 01:18:45,592
共享标签页组
with Shared Tab Groups

1370
01:18:45,626 --> 01:18:49,029
无论你是在和朋友计划旅行还是和你的伴侣选购沙发
Whether you're planning a trip with friends or shopping for a couch

1371
01:18:49,062 --> 01:18:52,099
都可以把所有的标签页分享在一处
with your partner, you can share all the tabs in one place

1372
01:18:52,132 --> 01:18:55,869
而如果他们也找到了不错的内容他们也可以添加标签页
And when they find something great, they can add tabs too

1373
01:18:55,903 --> 01:18:59,072
你可以实时查看你的朋友们正在浏览的标签页
You can see which tabs your friends are looking at live

1374
01:18:59,106 --> 01:19:02,476
并且通过内置的协作功能你们也能
and using built-in collaboration, you can easily connect in real time

1375
01:19:02,509 --> 01:19:04,311
通过信息 app 和 FaceTime 通话来实时联络
over Messages or FaceTime

1376
01:19:04,344 --> 01:19:07,381
和亲友共同探索网络世界变得非常容易
It's so easy to discover the web together

1377
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:12,186
接下来我们还有能让网络空间变得更安全的新方法
And next, we have a new way to make the web a safer place

1378
01:19:12,219 --> 01:19:15,856
我们依靠密码来保护我们最隐私的账号
We rely on passwords to protect our most private accounts

1379
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:19,793
虽然 Safari 浏览器可以帮用户创建最强的密码
While Safari helps users create the strongest passwords possible

1380
01:19:19,826 --> 01:19:23,130
但仍有一些方法可以让账户遭到破坏
there are still ways accounts can be compromised

1381
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:26,567
黑客会用网络钓鱼这样的社交工程技巧
Hackers can use social engineering techniques like phishing

1382
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,570
来诱使用户交出密码
to trick users into giving up passwords

1383
01:19:29,603 --> 01:19:31,772
他们还可以直接破解网站
They can also breach a website directly

1384
01:19:31,805 --> 01:19:35,642
以获取储存在服务器上的所有密码
to get access to all the passwords stored on its server

1385
01:19:35,676 --> 01:19:38,512
这就是为什么我们打造了
That's why we've helped create a next generation credential

1386
01:19:38,545 --> 01:19:41,348
更安全、更简便
that's more secure, easier to use

1387
01:19:41,381 --> 01:19:44,318
并且以替代密码为目标的新一代身份验证信息
and aims to replace passwords for good

1388
01:19:44,351 --> 01:19:48,422
我们叫它通行密钥
We call them passkeys

1389
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,558
通行密钥使用了强大的加密技术
Passkeys use powerful cryptographic techniques

1390
01:19:51,592 --> 01:19:55,262
和设备内置的生物识别技术来保护账户的安全
and the biometrics built into your device to keep accounts safe

1391
01:19:55,295 --> 01:19:58,365
只要使用触控 ID 或者面容 ID 进行身份验证
To create a passkey, just use TouchID

1392
01:19:58,398 --> 01:20:01,502
你就可以轻松创建通行密钥
or FaceID to authenticate, and you're done

1393
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:04,338
用户创建通行密钥的时候会产生一个独一无二的数字钥匙
When users create a passkey, a unique digital key is created

1394
01:20:04,371 --> 01:20:06,740
它只能用于创建它的网站
that only works for the site it was created for

1395
01:20:06,773 --> 01:20:08,775
通行密钥是无法被盗用的
Passkeys can't be phished

1396
01:20:08,809 --> 01:20:10,811
由于通行密钥永远不会离开你的设备
Since the passkey never leaves your devices

1397
01:20:10,844 --> 01:20:14,147
所以黑客无法诱使你把它分享在虚假网站上
hackers can't trick you into sharing it on a fake website

1398
01:20:14,181 --> 01:20:18,385
并且因为网络服务器上没有储存任何私密信息通行密钥也不会被泄露
And passkeys can't be leaked because nothing secret is kept on a web server

1399
01:20:18,418 --> 01:20:22,789
我们设计的通行密钥可以在 app 里轻松使用就像在网页上一样
We've designed passkeys to work in apps as easily as they do on the web

1400
01:20:22,823 --> 01:20:27,461
用 iCloud 钥匙串就可以把通行密钥在你的 Apple 设备上安全同步
Passkeys are securely synced across Apple devices using iCloud Keychain

1401
01:20:27,494 --> 01:20:33,934
并且可以在 Mac iPhone、iPad 和 Apple TV 上即时使用
and are instantly available on Mac

1356
01:20:29,463 --> 01:20:33,934
iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV

1402
01:20:33,967 --> 01:20:35,669
我们还和 FIDO alliance 中
We've been working with industry leaders

1403
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:38,105
包括谷歌和微软等合作
in the FIDO alliance including Google and Microsoft

1404
01:20:38,138 --> 01:20:42,142
以保证通行密钥能在不同平台间无缝使用
to ensure that passkeys work seamlessly cross-platform

1405
01:20:42,176 --> 01:20:45,412
有了通行密钥即使面对非 Apple 设备
With a passkey, you'll be able to walk up to a non-Apple device

1406
01:20:45,445 --> 01:20:49,183
你也可以用你的 iPhone 登录网站或 app
and sign in to a website or app using just your iPhone

1407
01:20:49,216 --> 01:20:51,952
这种脱离密码的转型并不会一蹴而就
The transition away from passwords will be a journey

1408
01:20:51,985 --> 01:20:55,722
我们期待和开发者们协同合作共同创造一个无密码的未来
and we look forward to working with developers on the password-less future

1409
01:20:55,756 --> 01:20:57,491
这些就是关于 Safari 浏览器的更新
And that's Safari

1410
01:20:57,524 --> 01:21:00,394
现在交回到 Craig
Now back over to you, Craig

1411
01:21:00,427 --> 01:21:02,796
我们相信这些对邮件 app 和 Safari 浏览器的更新
Craig: We think these updates to Mail and Safari

1412
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:04,131
可以帮你提高工作效率
will help you be productive and browse the web

1413
01:21:04,164 --> 01:21:07,434
并让你以更安全的新方式浏览网页
in new and safer ways

1414
01:21:07,467 --> 01:21:11,772
下面让我们来聊聊有趣的游戏部分
Next, let's have some fun and talk about gaming

1415
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:15,375
我们正处在一个交叉点上
We're at a point where two things are really coming together

1416
01:21:15,409 --> 01:21:19,213
一方面 Apple 芯片改变了一切
First, Apple Silicon has changed everything

1417
01:21:19,246 --> 01:21:23,650
它把所有 Mac 的图形性能都提升到了新的高度
It's taking the graphics performance of every new Mac to new heights

1418
01:21:23,684 --> 01:21:28,322
即使是要求最高的游戏在 Mac 上也能轻松运行
giving Macs the power to run the most demanding games, with ease

1419
01:21:28,355 --> 01:21:31,625
另一方面 Mac 的销量节节升高
Second, the Mac is more popular than ever

1420
01:21:31,658 --> 01:21:36,463
所以对于游戏开发者来说 Mac 带来了大量且不断增加的机会
and it's a huge and fast-growing opportunity for game developers

1421
01:21:36,496 --> 01:21:40,334
而且我们采用了统一的芯片架构
And since we have a unified silicon architecture spanning from iPhone and iPad

1422
01:21:40,367 --> 01:21:43,637
从 iPhone 和 iPad 直到 M1 Ultra 芯片
all the way up to M1 Ultra

1423
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:47,841
游戏开发人员可以在整条产品线上
game developers can scale the quality and performance of their titles

1424
01:21:47,875 --> 01:21:49,810
扩展他们游戏的质量和性能
across the entire line

1425
01:21:49,843 --> 01:21:55,148
另一个关于游戏体验的关键部分是为其提供支持的软件
Another key part of a great gaming experience is the software that powers it

1426
01:21:55,182 --> 01:21:58,352
这部分的更新就请 Jeremy 来告诉你
To tell you what's new, here's Jeremy

1427
01:22:01,722 --> 01:22:03,724
我们一直在对 Metal 做出改进
Jeremy Sandmel: We continue to improve Metal

1428
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:06,326
在我们所有的软件平台上都是这项软件技术
It's the software that powers hardware-accelerated graphics

1429
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:07,661
驱动着硬件加速带来的图形处理
on all our platforms

1430
01:22:07,694 --> 01:22:11,164
现在 Metal 3 带来的新功能
And now, Metal 3 brings new features that will unleash

1431
01:22:11,198 --> 01:22:14,701
将源源不断地释放 Apple 芯片的全部潜力
the full potential of Apple Silicon for years to come

1432
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:18,238
在最高的分辨率和画质下游戏体验会非常棒
Gaming at maximum resolution and quality looks awesome

1433
01:22:18,272 --> 01:22:21,508
为了帮助游戏开发人员提高图形性能
And to help game developers increase the performance of realistic

1434
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:26,013
带来更加逼真也更沉浸式的体验我们推出了 MetalFX 上采样
and immersive graphics, we're introducing MetalFX Upscaling

1435
01:22:26,046 --> 01:22:31,418
让开发人员可以更快速地渲染丰富而视觉复杂的图形
which enables developers to render rich, visually complex scenes even faster

1436
01:22:31,451 --> 01:22:34,855
它通过渲染较小且计算量较少的帧来工作
It works by rendering smaller, less compute-intensive frames

1437
01:22:34,888 --> 01:22:38,959
然后使用高质量的空间放大和时间抗锯齿
and then applies high-quality spatial upscaling and temporal anti-aliasing

1438
01:22:38,992 --> 01:22:40,327
效果非常棒
And it's so cool

1439
01:22:40,360 --> 01:22:42,529
即将在今年晚些时候登陆 Mac 的 No Man’s Sky
No Man's Sky, coming to Mac later this year

1440
01:22:42,563 --> 01:22:46,166
就是第一批使用 MetalFX 上采样技术的游戏之一
will be one of the first games to use MetalFX Upscaling

1441
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:51,605
它的帧率有所增加能给人带来反应灵敏的感觉并且看起来非常漂亮
The frame rate increases, giving you that responsive feel, and it looks beautiful

1442
01:22:51,638 --> 01:22:54,274
我们带来改进的另一个方面是游戏加载
Another area we're improving is game loading

1443
01:22:54,308 --> 01:22:57,978
游戏通过使用更丰富的纹理和更多几何细节
Games continue to push the boundaries and appear more realistic than ever before

1444
01:22:58,011 --> 01:23:00,814
不断突破边界变得更加逼真
by using richer textures and more geometric detail

1445
01:23:00,848 --> 01:23:02,649
而这也造成了更长的加载时间
which can take a while to load

1446
01:23:02,683 --> 01:23:05,719
所以 Metal 3 添加了新的快速资源加载 API
So Metal 3 adds a new fast resource loading API

1447
01:23:05,752 --> 01:23:08,789
它通过提供从存储到统一内存系统的更直接路径
that minimizes wait time by providing a more direct path

1448
01:23:08,822 --> 01:23:11,158
来最大限度地减少等待时间
from storage to the unified memory system

1449
01:23:11,191 --> 01:23:14,094
这样图形处理器就能更快速地
so the GPU can more quickly access high-quality textures

1450
01:23:14,127 --> 01:23:16,430
访问高质量纹理和缓冲区而无需等待
and buffers without waiting

1451
01:23:16,463 --> 01:23:20,100
Metal 3 和 Apple 芯片可以实现更沉浸式的视觉效果
Metal 3 and Apple Silicon enable even more immersive visuals

1452
01:23:20,133 --> 01:23:22,669
更好的性能和更快的加载速度
faster performance, and quicker loading

1453
01:23:22,703 --> 01:23:25,939
这的确为在 Mac 上玩游戏带来了新时代
This really is a new day for gaming on the Mac

1454
01:23:25,973 --> 01:23:27,441
当然不能光听我们自己说
But don't take our word for it

1455
01:23:27,474 --> 01:23:29,109
让我们听听来自创造了广受好评的
Let's hear from the team that has created

1456
01:23:29,142 --> 01:23:31,478
Resident Evil Village 游戏团队的意见吧
the acclaimed Resident Evil Village

1457
01:23:31,512 --> 01:23:33,747
我们非常高兴它即将登陆 Mac
We are so excited it's coming to the Mac

1458
01:23:33,780 --> 01:23:37,117
接下来请 Capcom 高级技术研究部的经理
To tell you more, we are delighted to introduce Ijuin-san

1459
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:41,021
Ijuin 先生来为你介绍更多吧
manager of Capcom's Advanced Technical Research Division

1460
01:23:41,054 --> 01:23:46,293
♪♪
♪♪

1461
01:23:46,326 --> 01:23:49,897
Resident Evil Village 一经公布就成为了一种定义游戏类型的游戏

1462
01:23:49,930 --> 01:23:53,534
为玩家带来了激动人心的有趣体验

1463
01:23:53,567 --> 01:23:57,437
时至今日这个系列依然在同类游戏中最受欢迎

1464
01:23:58,205 --> 01:24:02,276
所以我们非常高兴能为

1465
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:07,681
搭载 Apple 芯片的 Mac 产品线带来我们最新的游戏

1466
01:24:07,714 --> 01:24:11,618
得益于 Apple 芯片 Mac 如今具有超棒的性能

1467
01:24:11,652 --> 01:24:15,589
是一个出众的游戏平台

1468
01:24:15,622 --> 01:24:17,958
并且凭借我们对新 Metal 3 的支持

1469
01:24:17,991 --> 01:24:22,196
从 MacBook Air 到速度极快的 Mac Studio

1470
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:28,502
我们的游戏在 Apple 芯片上大放异彩

1471
01:24:29,269 --> 01:24:35,175
你可以看到我们可以非常流畅地在这些美到惊心动魄的场景中移动

1472
01:24:35,209 --> 01:24:41,381
我们在这里使用了高质量纹理几何图形和复杂的着色器

1473
01:24:42,249 --> 01:24:44,218
借助 MetalFX 上采样

1474
01:24:44,251 --> 01:24:48,522
我们可以在整个产品线上呈现绝佳的高分辨率视觉效果

1475
01:24:48,889 --> 01:24:53,360
MacBook Air 够以 1080p 轻松运行

1476
01:24:53,393 --> 01:24:59,132
Mac Studio 也可以带来的惊人 4K 体验

1477
01:24:59,867 --> 01:25:04,104
从前只有高性能游戏主机和游戏电脑

1478
01:25:04,137 --> 01:25:08,075
可以做到这一点

1479
01:25:08,108 --> 01:25:14,781
但现在我们把它引入了每一台由 Apple 芯片驱动的 Mac 上

1480
01:25:14,815 --> 01:25:19,953
我们对这些全新 Mac 能够实现的真实感惊叹不已

1481
01:25:20,721 --> 01:25:26,460
这些全新 Mac 产品可以毫不费力地处理好我们交给它们的任何任务

1482
01:25:26,493 --> 01:25:28,829
这真是不可思议！

1483
01:25:28,862 --> 01:25:35,035
我们迫不及待地想把这款游戏交到世界各地的 Mac 游戏玩家手中

1484
01:25:35,068 --> 01:25:39,339
请期待今年晚些时候发布的 Mac 版本的 Resident Evil Village 吧

1485
01:25:39,373 --> 01:25:41,041
这就是我今天全部的分享

1486
01:25:41,074 --> 01:25:42,943
非常感谢

1487
01:25:42,976 --> 01:25:45,078
现在让我们回到 Craig

1488
01:25:45,112 --> 01:25:47,481
感谢 Ijuin 先生的发言
Craig: Thank you, Ijuin-san

1489
01:25:47,514 --> 01:25:50,784
接下来我们要聊的是连续互通
Next, let's talk about Continuity

1490
01:25:50,817 --> 01:25:55,722
连续互通能让你在使用不同设备时拥有无缝衔接的体验
Continuity is all about giving you a seamless experience across devices

1491
01:25:55,756 --> 01:25:59,826
通用控制、隔空播放和接力等功能
Features like Universal Control, AirPlay, and Handoff

1492
01:25:59,860 --> 01:26:03,363
可以让你始终根据当下的情况使用最合适的设备
allow you to always use the right device for the moment

1493
01:26:03,397 --> 01:26:07,634
而今天我们要将接力功能扩展到 FaceTime 通话
And today, we're extending Handoff to FaceTime

1494
01:26:07,668 --> 01:26:11,004
想象一下你正在用 iPhone 进行 FaceTime 通话
Now picture this: you answer a FaceTime call on your iPhone

1495
01:26:11,038 --> 01:26:12,739
此时你并没有在桌前
while you're away from your desk

1496
01:26:12,773 --> 01:26:15,876
而当你到家之后将 iPhone 靠近 Mac 时
When you get home and bring your iPhone up close to your Mac

1497
01:26:15,909 --> 01:26:19,279
你的 Mac 就会自动识别出 iPhone 上的通话
your Mac automatically recognizes the call on your iPhone

1498
01:26:19,313 --> 01:26:22,015
这时你就可以让通话无缝切换到 Mac 上
and you can move it to your Mac seamlessly

1499
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:25,219
通话的视图也会变得更大
giving you a bigger view to continue the conversation

1500
01:26:25,252 --> 01:26:28,155
你的所有设备都能从任何方向接力你的通话
You can handoff calls in any direction between your devices

1501
01:26:28,188 --> 01:26:32,693
所以你始终都能用最合适的设备来继续通话
so you'll always be able to join the call from the right one

1502
01:26:32,726 --> 01:26:36,630
关于连续互通我们还有另一个好消息
We also have exciting news about another Continuity feature

1503
01:26:36,663 --> 01:26:41,602
那就是它会把你最好的相机和 Mac 上最大的显示屏相匹配
which pairs the best camera you own with the large displays on Mac

1504
01:26:41,635 --> 01:26:45,105
很多时候我们需要用到 Mac 的摄像头
We spend a lot of time in front of our Macs with our cameras on

1505
01:26:45,138 --> 01:26:49,943
而视频摄像头已经变成了我们工作、学习和娱乐中不可或缺的一部分
Our webcams have become an integral part of work, school, and play

1506
01:26:49,977 --> 01:26:52,579
现在连续互通相机
And now, with Continuity Camera

1507
01:26:52,613 --> 01:26:55,449
支持将 iPhone 作为你的视频摄像头了
you can use iPhone as your webcam

1508
01:26:55,482 --> 01:26:59,620
iPhone 相机系统的先进功能
It's powered by the advanced capabilities of the iPhone camera system

1509
01:26:59,653 --> 01:27:03,690
可以做到一般视频摄像头无法做到的事情
letting you do things that were never before possible with a webcam

1510
01:27:03,724 --> 01:27:05,959
我来向你展示一下它是如何运行的
Let me show you how it works

1511
01:27:05,993 --> 01:27:09,296
首先我把 iPhone 放在这个支架上
Now, I'm just gonna pop this stand on my iPhone

1512
01:27:09,329 --> 01:27:12,199
让它放置到我的显示器上
and attach it to my display

1513
01:27:12,232 --> 01:27:14,168
然后启动 FaceTime 通话
Let's launch FaceTime

1514
01:27:16,803 --> 01:27:19,673
你会看到我的 Mac 自动检测到了 iPhone
You can see my Mac automatically detects my iPhone

1515
01:27:19,706 --> 01:27:21,341
然后使用了 iPhone 的摄像头
and uses it as the camera

1516
01:27:21,375 --> 01:27:23,310
我甚至都不必唤醒我的 iPhone
I don't even have to wake up my iPhone

1517
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:26,346
而且这一切都可以无线完成不需要任何插拔
This all works wirelessly so there's nothing to plug in

1518
01:27:26,380 --> 01:27:30,117
那就让我们试试这个功能给设计工作室的朋友打个电话吧
So to try this out, let's call a friend in the design studio

1519
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,688
嗨 Craig！
Johnnie Manzari: Hi, Craig!

1520
01:27:34,721 --> 01:27:35,589
嘿 Johnnie！
Craig: Hey, Johnnie!

1521
01:27:35,622 --> 01:27:37,891
你愿意帮我演示一下连续互通相机吗？
Are you up for helping me give a demo of Continuity Camera?

1522
01:27:37,925 --> 01:27:39,726
当然  我现在就在用这个功能通过我的 iPhone
Johnnie: Sure, I'm using it right now

1523
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:42,796
和我的 Pro Display XDR 显示器
with my iPhone and Pro Display XDR

1524
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:46,400
关于连续互通相机我很喜欢的一点就是它的人物居中功能
You know, one thing I love about Continuity Camera is Center Stage

1525
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:49,770
我可以四处移动而人物居中功能会让我一直处于画面中
I can move around and Center Stage will keep me in the frame

1526
01:27:49,803 --> 01:27:52,706
我经常把它和人像模式一起使用
I'll frequently pair that with Portrait Mode

1527
01:27:52,739 --> 01:27:55,042
用虚化效果模糊我的背景
to blur the background with that beautiful boca

1528
01:27:55,075 --> 01:27:57,578
是的我真的很喜欢 iPad 上的这些功能
Craig: Yeah, I've loved having these features on my iPad

1529
01:27:57,611 --> 01:28:00,347
现在我们可以在任何 Mac 上使用它了实在是太好了
and it's great that we can now use them with any Mac

1530
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,215
当然
Johnnie: For sure

1531
01:28:01,248 --> 01:28:03,650
还有一个大家会喜欢的新功能那就是摄影室灯光
A new one people are gonna love is Studio Light

1532
01:28:03,684 --> 01:28:05,219
来看看这个
Check this out

1533
01:28:05,252 --> 01:28:08,188
它可以让我的面部变亮而让背景变暗
It brightens my face and darkens the background

1534
01:28:08,222 --> 01:28:09,089
看起来真不错
Craig: Hey, that looks great

1535
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:10,891
就好像你开了环形补光灯一样
It's almost like you have a ring-light

1536
01:28:10,924 --> 01:28:13,527
它非常适合在我光线条件较差的时候使用
Johnnie: It is perfect for tough lighting conditions

1537
01:28:13,560 --> 01:28:16,163
看起来就像我坐在窗前一样
like if I'm ever sitting in front of a window

1538
01:28:16,196 --> 01:28:21,835
现在我想展示我最喜欢的新功能桌面视图
Okay, now I wanna show my favorite new feature, Desk View

1539
01:28:21,869 --> 01:28:23,871
你可以看到我桌面上的工作
You can see the work that's on my desk

1540
01:28:23,904 --> 01:28:25,939
而且还能让我也出现在画面中
and it keeps me in the picture

1541
01:28:25,973 --> 01:28:28,008
这个功能实在是很棒
It is amazing

1542
01:28:28,041 --> 01:28:29,943
你看
Take a look

1543
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,546
它看起来就像我安装了专用的俯视角摄像头一样
It looks like I have a dedicated overhead camera

1544
01:28:32,579 --> 01:28:36,049
但这其实是桌面视图功能产生出的两个视图
but this is Desk View creating both of these views

1545
01:28:36,083 --> 01:28:39,353
使用了 iPhone 上的超广角摄像头
from the one ultra-wide camera on my iPhone

1546
01:28:39,386 --> 01:28:42,723
和非常强大的图像处理技术
using some very powerful image processing

1547
01:28:42,756 --> 01:28:45,459
我甚至都不用调整我的手机
I didn't even need to adjust my phone

1548
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:48,762
桌面视图非常适合用来给我的团队分享新设计
Desk View's gonna be great for sharing new designs with my team

1549
01:28:48,795 --> 01:28:52,966
我甚至可以用它给我的侄子展示新的纸牌技巧
I can even use it to show my nephew a new card trick

1550
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:54,768
这真的特别酷
Craig: This is gonna be so cool

1551
01:28:54,801 --> 01:28:58,105
好的 Johnnie 谢谢你为我们带来的演示
Well, hey, Johnnie, thanks for helping us give the quick demo

1552
01:28:58,138 --> 01:28:59,773
不客气我们一会儿再聊
Johnnie: No problem. I'll talk to you later

1553
01:29:01,208 --> 01:29:04,111
除了 FaceTime 通话你还可以用连续互通相机
Craig: In addition to FaceTime, you can use Continuity Camera

1554
01:29:04,144 --> 01:29:06,380
和 macOS 上的任何视频会议 app 配合使用
with any macOS videoconferencing app

1555
01:29:06,413 --> 01:29:09,883
比如 Zoom、Teams、Webex 等
like Zoom, Teams, Webex, and more

1556
01:29:09,917 --> 01:29:12,586
我们正在和 Belkin 合作会为用户带来精美的手机支架
And we're working with Belkin to offer beautiful stands

1557
01:29:12,619 --> 01:29:15,522
以恰好的高度和角度固定你的 iPhone
to hold your iPhone at the perfect height and angle

1558
01:29:15,556 --> 01:29:17,858
它们会在今年晚些时候上市
These will be available later this year

1559
01:29:17,891 --> 01:29:21,228
而且你们中的很多人同时拥有一台 Mac 和一部 iPhone
And since so many of you with a Mac already have an iPhone

1560
01:29:21,261 --> 01:29:25,632
所以这些新功能在你已经拥有的设备上就能实现
these great capabilities come with the devices you already own

1561
01:29:25,666 --> 01:29:27,868
这就是连续互通的魔力
That's the magic of Continuity

1562
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:30,304
以上这些就是我们的 macOS Ventura
And that's macOS Ventura

1563
01:29:30,337 --> 01:29:34,741
这是一个功能丰富的版本它带来了管理窗口的新工具
a feature-packed release that brings new tools for managing windows

1564
01:29:34,775 --> 01:29:38,212
为邮件 app、 Safari 浏览器和游戏带来了智能的新功能
smart new features for Mail, Safari, and games

1565
01:29:38,245 --> 01:29:41,415
还有神奇的连续互通新功能
and magical new Continuity features

1566
01:29:41,448 --> 01:29:45,986
下面我们要谈到的是 iPadOS
Now let's turn to iPadOS

1567
01:29:46,019 --> 01:29:54,027
♪♪
♪♪

1568
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:02,302
我们对 iPadOS 的愿景是
Our vision for iPadOS

1569
01:30:02,336 --> 01:30:07,207
创造一种基于 iOS 优点的独特体验
is to create a distinct experience

1498
01:30:04,872 --> 01:30:07,207
that's built on the best of iOS

1570
01:30:07,241 --> 01:30:11,645
例如保证安全性具有移动性和直观的触控优先界面
like security, mobility, and an intuitive touch-first interface

1571
01:30:11,678 --> 01:30:14,515
它拥有 macOS 的强大功能
with powerful capabilities from macOS

1572
01:30:14,548 --> 01:30:17,718
比如多任务处理和触控板支持
like multitasking and trackpad support

1573
01:30:17,751 --> 01:30:22,523
并与 iPad 独有的功能相结合例如 Apple Pencil
combined with features like Apple Pencil that are uniquely iPad

1574
01:30:22,556 --> 01:30:27,060
所有这些特点结合在一起就组成了我们最全能的设备
All of this comes together to deliver our most versatile device

1575
01:30:27,094 --> 01:30:31,298
今年的 iPadOS 16 是一个重要的版本
This year in iPadOS 16, we have a big release

1576
01:30:31,331 --> 01:30:34,635
它将进一步提升 iPad 的这种多用性
that's going to take this versatility even further

1577
01:30:34,668 --> 01:30:39,139
首先就是你已经在 iOS 和 macOS 中听过的一系列功能
Starting with a host of features that you heard about earlier in iOS and macOS

1578
01:30:39,173 --> 01:30:41,875
这些功能也会适用于 iPad
that are going to be great on iPad

1579
01:30:41,909 --> 01:30:43,644
例如共享图库
like Shared Photo Library

1580
01:30:43,677 --> 01:30:46,914
共享标签页组 Safari 浏览器中的通行密钥
Shared Tab Groups and Passkeys in Safari

1581
01:30:46,947 --> 01:30:49,483
还有邮件 app 中的重大更新
and a big update to Mail

1582
01:30:49,516 --> 01:30:51,752
我们也会把天气功能引入 iPad
We're also bringing Weather to iPad

1583
01:30:51,785 --> 01:30:55,556
充分利用漂亮的显示屏和出色的动画效果
taking full advantage of the stunning display with beautiful animations

1584
01:30:55,589 --> 01:30:57,658
比如这些缓缓移动的云
like these gently moving clouds

1585
01:30:57,691 --> 01:31:00,594
还有大雪和大雨的画面
heavy snowfall, and driving rain

1586
01:31:00,627 --> 01:31:05,265
并且所有模块都可以通过轻点来访问详细信息
And all of these modules are tappable to access detailed information

1587
01:31:05,299 --> 01:31:08,302
而针对开发人员我们也会发布 WeatherKit
And for developers, we're announcing WeatherKit

1588
01:31:08,335 --> 01:31:11,438
这样他们就可以把天气信息内置在他们的 app 中了
so they can build weather into their apps

1589
01:31:11,471 --> 01:31:15,776
iPadOS 16 也包含了与他人协作的新方式
iPadOS 16 also includes new ways to collaborate with others

1590
01:31:15,809 --> 01:31:17,477
功能更强大的 app
more capable apps, and new features for Pro users

1591
01:31:17,511 --> 01:31:22,883
还有为专业用户提供的能充分利用 M1 芯片的新功能
that take advantage of the power of the M1 chip

1592
01:31:22,916 --> 01:31:25,319
那我们就先来了解协作
So let's start with collaboration

1593
01:31:25,352 --> 01:31:27,354
它常常从信息 app 开始
which often begins in Messages

1594
01:31:27,387 --> 01:31:29,623
你被要求传输一份文件
when you're asked to pass along a document

1595
01:31:29,656 --> 01:31:31,425
当然你可以发送一份副本
Of course, you could send a copy

1596
01:31:31,458 --> 01:31:35,429
但现在你也可以在用共享表单发送文件时
but now you can also instantly kick off a collaboration

1597
01:31:35,462 --> 01:31:37,464
立即启动协作
when you send something with the Share Sheet

1598
01:31:37,497 --> 01:31:40,767
这个功能把在整个系统中发起协作
This makes initiating collaboration across the system

1599
01:31:40,801 --> 01:31:42,569
变得像发送链接一样容易
as easy as sending a link

1600
01:31:42,603 --> 01:31:47,374
并且意味着你只需要轻轻一点就能与协作者发起对话了
and means a conversation with your collaborators is always just a tap away

1601
01:31:47,407 --> 01:31:49,343
我来向你展示一下它是怎样操作的
Let me show you how it works

1602
01:31:50,944 --> 01:31:54,047
那就让我们点进信息 app
So let's tap in to Messages

1603
01:31:54,081 --> 01:31:56,683
我一直在和团队讨论一个接下来的场外活动
I've been talking to the team about an upcoming offsite

1604
01:31:56,717 --> 01:32:00,187
我们在利用这次谈话确定细节
and we've been using this conversation to figure out the details

1605
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:03,390
现在看起来 Lopp 发来了一条信息
Now, it looks like a message just came in from Lopp

1606
01:32:03,423 --> 01:32:05,492
他想要了解最新的消息
and he wants to catch up on the latest

1607
01:32:05,526 --> 01:32:09,162
在这边的 Pages 文稿里面我记录搜集了我们的想法
Over here in Pages, I've been collecting our ideas

1608
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:11,031
我想要和小组成员们分享这些文稿
I want to share this with the group

1609
01:32:11,064 --> 01:32:13,433
在过去我点击分享的时候
In the past, when I'd tap Share

1610
01:32:13,467 --> 01:32:15,335
最终分享的是一份副本
I'd end up sharing a copy

1611
01:32:15,369 --> 01:32:19,773
现在你会注意到我可以直接在这里发起协作
But now, you'll notice I can start collaboration right here

1612
01:32:19,806 --> 01:32:22,776
而且最好的一点就是我不需要把大家的名字或者邮件地址
And what's great is, I don't need to type in a bunch of names

1613
01:32:22,809 --> 01:32:24,344
都打出来
or email addresses

1614
01:32:24,378 --> 01:32:29,116
只要我选择一个信息组每个人就自动被添加进来了
When I select a Messages group, everyone gets added automatically

1615
01:32:29,149 --> 01:32:31,285
让我们把文件发给大家吧
Let's go ahead and send it

1616
01:32:33,587 --> 01:32:37,524
这让你可以更加容易地与已经在沟通的人协作
This makes it way easier to collaborate with people

1546
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:37,524
you're already communicating with

1617
01:32:37,558 --> 01:32:40,827
每个人都可以立即加入并且开始编辑
Everyone can immediately join and start making edits

1618
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,663
就像你在这里看到的一样
like the ones you see here

1619
01:32:42,696 --> 01:32:44,831
而在信息 app 的对话中
And back in the Messages conversation

1620
01:32:44,865 --> 01:32:48,268
我甚至能收到我可能错过的任何修改的通知
I even get a notice of any changes I might have missed

1621
01:32:48,302 --> 01:32:49,536
当你用这种方式协作时
When you collaborate this way, your document is connected

1622
01:32:49,570 --> 01:32:52,372
你的文件就会和对话相关联
to the conversation

1623
01:32:52,406 --> 01:32:54,374
小组会在工具栏中出现
The group appears in the toolbar

1624
01:32:54,408 --> 01:32:57,911
我可以直接从这里开始交流
and I can kick off communication right from here

1625
01:32:57,945 --> 01:33:00,314
我可以随时回到信息 app 中的对话
I can get back to the messages conversation

1626
01:33:00,347 --> 01:33:02,316
或者发起 FaceTime 通话
or initiate a FaceTime call

1627
01:33:02,349 --> 01:33:06,486
让我们给小组成员发起通话试试看
Let's go ahead and call the group

1628
01:33:08,288 --> 01:33:09,723
嗨大家好！
Hey, everyone!

1629
01:33:09,756 --> 01:33:10,858
嗨 Craig！
Michael Lopp: Hey, Craig

1630
01:33:10,891 --> 01:33:13,861
嗨我看到你们有几个人在文件里
Craig: Hey, I saw that a few of you were in the document

1631
01:33:13,894 --> 01:33:16,697
你们对场外活动还有其它想法吗
Does anyone have any other ideas for the offsite?

1632
01:33:16,730 --> 01:33:19,766
是的我一直在考虑并且收集了一些标签页
Lopp: Yeah, I've been thinking about it, and I've been collecting a few tabs

1633
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,568
我现在就从 Safari 浏览器把它们分享给你
I'm gonna share them right now with you in Safari

1634
01:33:21,602 --> 01:33:23,604
谢谢 Lopp
Craig: Thanks, Lopp

1635
01:33:23,637 --> 01:33:27,641
今年你可以直接在 FaceTime 通话里开始与小组协作
This year, you can start collaborating with the group right in FaceTime

1636
01:33:27,674 --> 01:33:31,979
你可以看到 Lopp 刚才邀请我在 Safari 浏览器的一组标签页中协作
You can see that Lopp just invited me to collaborate on a set of tabs in Safari

1637
01:33:32,012 --> 01:33:35,415
我现在要接受他的邀请
I'm gonna go ahead and accept his invite

1638
01:33:35,449 --> 01:33:38,519
然后我就可以在 Safari 浏览器中看到这些标签页了
and now, I can get to them in Safari

1639
01:33:38,552 --> 01:33:40,454
就像之前的 Pages 文稿文件一样
Just like with the Pages document

1640
01:33:40,487 --> 01:33:43,957
小组里的每个人都自动拥有了这些标签页的访问权限
everyone in the group automatically has access

1641
01:33:43,991 --> 01:33:46,860
我能看到 Anne 和 Mindy 加入了这个标签组
I can see Anne and Mindy joining the tab group

1642
01:33:46,894 --> 01:33:50,998
我甚至可以在标签栏里看到大家正在看哪些标签页
and I can even see which tabs people are looking at right in the tab bar

1643
01:33:51,031 --> 01:33:54,535
看起来 Mindy 正在看皮划艇
Looks like Mindy is checking out kayaking

1644
01:33:54,568 --> 01:33:56,970
我又找到了一些来看看吧
Lopp: Found a few more. Check these out

1645
01:33:57,004 --> 01:33:59,840
当 Lopp 添加标签页时它们会立即出现
Craig: When Lopp adds tabs, they instantly appear

1646
01:33:59,873 --> 01:34:02,543
这样我们所有人都可以查看了
so we can all check them out

1647
01:34:02,576 --> 01:34:06,113
让我们来看看我们去年已经做过这个了
Let's see, we already did this last year

1648
01:34:06,146 --> 01:34:08,749
但是高空滑索看起来很酷
but ziplining looks cool!

1649
01:34:08,782 --> 01:34:10,684
这样吧各位让我们总结一下
All right, team, let's wrap this up

1650
01:34:10,717 --> 01:34:13,921
把最新的想法添加到文档里
and update our document with the latest ideas

1651
01:34:16,256 --> 01:34:18,292
看起来 Anne 正在更新文本
Looks like Anne is updating the text

1652
01:34:18,325 --> 01:34:20,327
而 Mindy 刚刚添加了一张图片
and Mindy just dropped in an image

1653
01:34:20,360 --> 01:34:22,763
这样我们就都准备好了
so we're all set

1654
01:34:22,796 --> 01:34:26,934
那么以上就是对在 iPadOS 16 中
So that's a quick look at some of the new ways

1655
01:34:26,967 --> 01:34:30,604
用协作功能工作的简介
you can work together with collaboration with iPadOS 16

1656
01:34:30,637 --> 01:34:32,873
除了 Pages 文稿和 Safari 浏览器
In addition to Pages and Safari

1657
01:34:32,906 --> 01:34:35,976
这些新的协作功能还可以和其他各种 app 一起使用
these new collaboration features will work with a variety of apps

1658
01:34:36,009 --> 01:34:38,145
比如备忘录和 Keynote 讲演
like Notes and Keynote

1659
01:34:38,178 --> 01:34:42,616
而对于开发者则会有新的 API 来让他们在自己的 app 中集成协作
And for developers, there's a new API to integrate collaboration in their apps

1660
01:34:42,649 --> 01:34:47,354
这些功能也会添加到 iOS 和 macOS
and these features will also be coming to iOS and macOS

1661
01:34:47,387 --> 01:34:49,690
当然在实时协作时
Of course, when you're collaborating live

1662
01:34:49,723 --> 01:34:52,226
有时你会需要一个不受限的空间
sometimes you want a space where you can brainstorm

1663
01:34:52,259 --> 01:34:54,895
用来头脑风暴捕捉灵感
and capture ideas as they strike

1664
01:34:54,928 --> 01:34:58,665
所以今天就让你先睹为快一个叫做 Freeform 的全新 app
So today, we're giving you a sneak peek at a brand-new app called Freeform

1665
01:34:58,699 --> 01:35:01,602
它会在今年晚些时候发布
coming later this year

1666
01:35:01,635 --> 01:35:04,404
让 Elizabeth 为你详细介绍吧
To tell you all about it, here's Elizabeth

1667
01:35:07,574 --> 01:35:10,577
我们有各种各样的精彩方式来达成协作
Elizabeth Reid: We have so many great ways to collaborate

1668
01:35:10,611 --> 01:35:13,313
但是直到今日你还是没有一个空间可以用来工作
but up until now, you didn't have a space to work in

1669
01:35:13,347 --> 01:35:16,450
用来开展小组会议规划项目
a place for group sessions, project planning

1670
01:35:16,483 --> 01:35:18,485
家庭装修或者完成学校作业等等
home renovations, or school projects

1671
01:35:18,519 --> 01:35:20,821
现在即使你正在 FaceTime 通话中
Now, you can be on a FaceTime call

1672
01:35:20,854 --> 01:35:21,855
只要轻点一下
and with a tap, you're all collaborating live on a Freeform board

1673
01:35:21,889 --> 01:35:25,025
你就可以在一个 Freeform board 中开始实时合作了

1674
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:27,060
你可以在画板上添加几乎任何东西
You can add almost anything to a board

1675
01:35:27,094 --> 01:35:31,298
它非常适合用来头脑风暴会议记笔记、共享文件
It's perfect for brainstorming sessions, jotting down notes

1676
01:35:31,331 --> 01:35:33,567
或是和其他人一起创建图表
sharing files, or even creating diagrams with others

1677
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:37,070
它非常灵活多变唯一限制它的只有你的想象力
It's flexible, limited only by your imagination

1678
01:35:37,104 --> 01:35:38,906
当别人写下他们想法的时候
As others begin adding their thoughts

1679
01:35:38,939 --> 01:35:42,509
你可以看到他们的光标在实时向你展示他们工作的位置
you can see their live cursors showing you right where they're working

1680
01:35:42,543 --> 01:35:44,545
如果有人在用 Freeform 的另一部分
And if someone is in another part of Freeform

1681
01:35:44,578 --> 01:35:47,681
你只要轻点就可以直接跳转到他们在画板上的位置了
you can just tap to jump straight to where they are on the board

1682
01:35:47,714 --> 01:35:51,718
而如果你需要更多空间只需要用手指触控屏幕来移动就可以了
And any time you need more space, move around simply using touch

1683
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:54,855
或者可以通过手指缩放专注在真正重要的事情上
or focus on what's really important with a pinch

1684
01:35:54,888 --> 01:35:57,758
当然画布还配备了完整的绘画工具
Of course, with a full complement of drawing tools

1685
01:35:57,791 --> 01:36:01,995
用 Apple Pencil 就可以随心所欲画草图记笔记
you can sketch or write a note anywhere you'd like with Apple Pencil

1686
01:36:02,029 --> 01:36:05,632
iPad 上有无数用来创作的强大工具
And with all the powerful tools to create content on iPad

1687
01:36:05,666 --> 01:36:08,101
而 Freeform 则是把它们整合在一起的地方
Freeform is a great place to pull it all together

1688
01:36:08,135 --> 01:36:11,605
你可以把包括照片、视频、音频
including photos, video, audio

1689
01:36:11,638 --> 01:36:14,708
文档、PDF 文件、网页链接在内的
documents, PDFs, web links

1690
01:36:14,741 --> 01:36:18,946
任何你需要的东西放到画板上
pretty much anything you need to work with can be brought onto your board

1691
01:36:18,979 --> 01:36:22,449
而且你还可以直接预览甚至可以预览多页文档
And you can preview right in line, including multipage documents

1692
01:36:22,482 --> 01:36:24,117
和高分辨率视频
and high-resolution videos

1693
01:36:24,151 --> 01:36:25,485
这些工具可以为你提供所需要的一切
giving you everything you need

1694
01:36:25,519 --> 01:36:28,755
让你的想法触手可及
to bring your ideas to life right at your fingertips

1695
01:36:28,789 --> 01:36:30,691
这就是 Freeform 的简介
And that's a sneak peek at Freeform

1696
01:36:30,724 --> 01:36:33,293
交回给你 Craig
Back to you, Craig

1697
01:36:33,327 --> 01:36:35,529
Freeform 非常适合用来
Craig: Freeform is going to be a great way

1698
01:36:35,562 --> 01:36:37,397
与他人集思广益
to brainstorm your ideas with others

1699
01:36:37,431 --> 01:36:39,800
而且今年晚些时候我们要把它
and we're building it right into iPadOS

1700
01:36:39,833 --> 01:36:43,370
引入 iPadOS、macOS 还有 iOS
macOS, and iOS later this year

1701
01:36:43,403 --> 01:36:46,773
当然 iPad 的多用性意味着
Of course, the versatility of iPad means you can seamlessly move

1702
01:36:46,807 --> 01:36:50,811
你可以让工作和游戏无缝衔接
from being productive to gaming

1703
01:36:50,844 --> 01:36:53,780
凭借它绚丽的显示屏和各种内置传感器
With its stunning display, built-in sensors

1704
01:36:53,814 --> 01:36:56,183
还有对常用游戏手柄的支持
and support for your favorite game controller

1705
01:36:56,216 --> 01:36:59,620
iPad 带来了绝佳的游戏体验
iPad provides a great gaming experience

1706
01:36:59,653 --> 01:37:03,056
并且 M1 芯片带来了超高图形处理性能

1707
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:07,427
为 Divinity Original Sin 2 这样的沉浸式游戏提供支持

1708
01:37:07,461 --> 01:37:11,331
在 iPadOS 16 中我们还带来了对游戏的更新
In iPadOS 16, we have some great updates to gaming

1709
01:37:11,365 --> 01:37:13,467
首先 Metal 3 为 iPad 带来了
starting with Metal 3

1710
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:18,972
我们之前在 macOS 中讲到的相同的 MetalFX 上采样技术
which brings the same MetalFX upscaling

1711
01:37:19,006 --> 01:37:21,642
和快速资源加载 API
and fast resource loading API to iPad that we talked about earlier with macOS

1712
01:37:21,675 --> 01:37:23,911
还有新的 API
There's also a new API

1713
01:37:23,944 --> 01:37:27,548
可以让游戏在后台下载大型资源
that lets games download large assets in the background

1714
01:37:27,581 --> 01:37:32,152
让你在下载的过程中也能执行多项任务
enabling you to multitask while the download completes

1715
01:37:32,186 --> 01:37:37,157
在 iPad 上游戏的另一个好处就是让我们共享精彩
Another important aspect to gaming on iPad is how it brings us together

1716
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:40,227
成千上万的游戏都用 Game Center
Tens of thousands of games use Game Center to help us

1717
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:43,430
来帮助我们和朋友一起游戏或者比拼
play with our friends or compete against each other

1718
01:37:43,463 --> 01:37:47,501
使用你的 Game Center 资料就无需创建新账户
It's easy to jump right in and play without creating a new account

1719
01:37:47,534 --> 01:37:50,170
直接进入游戏
using your Game Center profile

1720
01:37:50,204 --> 01:37:54,107
你可以找到一起玩的朋友在排行榜上比拼分数
You can find friends to play with, compare scores on leaderboards

1721
01:37:54,141 --> 01:37:56,643
并通过成就跟踪进度
and track progress through achievements

1722
01:37:56,677 --> 01:38:00,747
现在我们在 Game Center 主页添加了活动功能
And now, we're bringing Activity to the Game Center dashboard

1723
01:38:00,781 --> 01:38:04,184
你可以看到你的朋友正在玩什么游戏他们取得了哪些成就
You can see what your friends are playing, highlights of their achievements

1724
01:38:04,218 --> 01:38:06,854
甚至可以了解他们什么时候分数超过了你
and even find out when they beat your high score

1725
01:38:06,887 --> 01:38:10,057
这样你就会知道是时候把你的游戏提高到新的水准
so you know when it's time to take your game to the next level

1726
01:38:10,090 --> 01:38:11,992
重新占领鳌头了
and get back on top

1727
01:38:12,025 --> 01:38:15,929
所有这些活动都会出现在你的 Game Center 资料上
And all of this activity appears on your Game Center profile

1728
01:38:15,963 --> 01:38:19,800
Game Center 一直都支持实时联机游戏

1735
01:38:41,121 --> 01:38:45,359
iPad 的多用性让它能用来做各种各样的事
The versatility of iPad makes it great for so many things

1736
01:38:45,392 --> 01:38:48,262
而其中有很大一部分都是 app 做到的
and a big part of that is apps

1737
01:38:48,295 --> 01:38:52,900
今年我们将持续努力让 iPad 上的 app
This year, we're continuing our work to make iPad apps more capable

1738
01:38:52,933 --> 01:38:55,869
更符合桌面级 app 的要求

1739
01:38:55,903 --> 01:38:59,306
虽然许多 iPad 上的 app 都起源于 iOS
While many iPad apps have their origins in iOS

1740
01:38:59,339 --> 01:39:03,410
而这些年来很多 app 纷纷推出了各种独特功能
over the years, they've taken on their own unique capabilities

1741
01:39:03,443 --> 01:39:06,947
专门针对 iPad 更大的显示屏进行了优化适配
optimized for the iPad's larger display

1742
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:10,817
在 iPadOS 16 中我们针对整个系统

1743
01:39:10,851 --> 01:39:13,353
进行了全面的优化
adding enhancements across the board

1744
01:39:13,387 --> 01:39:15,722
从系统元素到交互方式

01:39:15,756 --> 01:39:19,960
还有你在 Mac 上使用过并希望在 iPad 上实现的新功能
to new features you use on Mac and want on iPad

1746
01:39:19,993 --> 01:39:21,862
我要强调其中的几点
Let me highlight a few of them

1747
01:39:21,895 --> 01:39:24,565
跨系统撤销/重做
Undo/redo across the system

1748
01:39:24,598 --> 01:39:26,867
日历中的可用性视图

1749
01:39:26,900 --> 01:39:30,904
在联系人中查找和合并名片还有创建列表
find and merge cards and create lists in Contacts

1750
01:39:30,938 --> 01:39:33,073
我们还对文件 app 进行了重大更新
and we have a big update to Files

1751
01:39:33,106 --> 01:39:35,108
增加了许多大家一直希望的功能
with some of the most requested features

1752
01:39:35,142 --> 01:39:37,611
比如更改文件扩展名
such as the ability to change file extensions

1753
01:39:37,644 --> 01:39:40,247
查看文件夹大小等
view folder size, and more

1754
01:39:40,280 --> 01:39:45,018
我们还添加了许多系统级功能为各种 app 都带来了优化体验
We've also added system-wide features that deliver improvements across apps

1755
01:39:45,052 --> 01:39:48,021
首先就是经过重新设计的
starting with a redesigned find and replace experience

1756
01:39:48,055 --> 01:39:50,023
查找和替换
that works in-line

1757
01:39:50,057 --> 01:39:53,861
在文件、Pages 文稿 Keynote 讲演等 app 的文档菜单中
A document menu in apps like Files, Pages, and Keynote

1758
01:39:53,894 --> 01:39:56,196

1759
01:39:56,230 --> 01:39:59,900
如复制、重命名、导出和打印

1760
01:39:59,933 --> 01:40:04,905
并且在 iPadOS 中首次实现了可定制的工具栏
And for the first time ever, customizable toolbars in iPadOS

1761
01:40:04,938 --> 01:40:08,208
这样你就可以自由添加对你最重要的工具
so you can add the tools that matter to you most

1762
01:40:08,242 --> 01:40:11,311
而对于开发人员我们提供了一系列 API
And for developers, we've created new APIs

1763
01:40:11,345 --> 01:40:15,315
这样他们就能在自己的 app 中创建这些功能了

1764
01:40:15,349 --> 01:40:18,418
这些功能可以让你更高效
These features will help you be more productive

1765
01:40:18,452 --> 01:40:20,988
还有一个来自 Mac 的功能

1767
01:40:23,156 --> 01:40:25,492
那就是参考颜色
And that is reference color

1768
01:40:25,526 --> 01:40:30,097
我们最新的 12.9 英寸 iPad Pro 配备了 Liquid 视网膜 XDR 显示屏
The Liquid Retina XDR display in our latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro

1769
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:33,267
适合专业的色彩工作流程使用

1770
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:37,638
而在 iPadOS 16 我们引入了参考模式
And with iPadOS 16, we're introducing Reference Mode

1771
01:40:37,671 --> 01:40:41,575
其色彩标准可用在各类工作流中例如一起讨论、审批
which meets the color requirements in workflows like review and approve

1772
01:40:41,608 --> 01:40:43,710
校色、色彩合成等
color grading, and compositing

1773
01:40:43,744 --> 01:40:47,748
在这些工作流程中准确的色彩和统一的图像质量非常重要
where accurate colors and consistent image quality are critical

1774
01:40:47,781 --> 01:40:51,485
因此不管你是想要把 iPad Pro 作为独立设备使用

1775
01:40:51,518 --> 01:40:54,087
还是使用随航功能让 iPad 作为第二台显示器
or as a second display with Sidecar

1776
01:40:54,121 --> 01:40:57,624
参考模式都能为你的专业设备
Reference Mode provides a consistent reference workflow

1777
01:40:57,658 --> 01:40:59,293
提供统一的参考工作流程
across your pro devices

1778
01:40:59,326 --> 01:41:04,398
让 iPad Pro 成为创意人士不可或缺的工具
making iPad Pro an indispensable tool for creative professionals

1779
01:41:04,431 --> 01:41:07,734
现在我想要来聊聊最新的 iPad Pro 和 iPad Air 中
Now, I want to turn our attention to a set of features

1780
01:41:07,768 --> 01:41:14,374
M1 芯片的性能所带来的一系列功能
enabled by the performance of the M1 chip

1710
01:41:10,871 --> 01:41:14,374
in our latest iPad Pro and iPad Air

1781
01:41:14,408 --> 01:41:19,880
这些功能是为那些将 iPad 的多用性发挥到极致的人准备的
Features for people who push the versatility of iPad to the limit

1782
01:41:19,913 --> 01:41:22,916
专业人士总会希望有更多工作空间
Pros are always wanting more space to work with

1783
01:41:22,950 --> 01:41:26,253
所以我们增加了一个新的显示缩放设置
so we're adding a new display scaling setting

1784
01:41:26,286 --> 01:41:29,623
它可以让你增加显示器的像素密度
which allows you to increase the pixel density of the display

1785
01:41:29,656 --> 01:41:31,525
这样你就可以在 app 中查看更多内容
so you can view more in your apps

1786
01:41:31,558 --> 01:41:34,795
这点在使用分屏浏览的时候特别有用
which is particularly helpful when using Split View

1787
01:41:34,828 --> 01:41:38,065
我们还希望帮助你在 app 中做更多事情
We also want to enable you to do more in apps

1788
01:41:38,098 --> 01:41:40,000
我们最新的 iPad Air 和 iPad Pro
Our latest iPad Air and iPad Pro

1789
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:44,104
配备了大量超快内存和储存空间
come with a ton of ultra-fast memory and storage

1790
01:41:44,137 --> 01:41:48,509
iPadOS 16 增加了对虚拟内存交换的支持
iPadOS 16 adds support for virtual memory swap

1791
01:41:48,542 --> 01:41:50,310
这意味着你的 iPad 储存空间
meaning your iPad storage can be used

1792
01:41:50,344 --> 01:41:53,380
可以用来扩展所有 app 的可用内存
to expand the available memory for all apps

1793
01:41:53,413 --> 01:41:58,752
而且还能为要求最高的 app 提供高达 16GB 的内存
and delivers up to 16 GB of memory to the most demanding apps

1794
01:41:58,785 --> 01:42:02,723
有了显示缩放和虚拟内存交换等技术
With technologies like display scaling and virtual memory swap

1795
01:42:02,756 --> 01:42:07,294
我们就为在用户体验方面实现飞跃奠定了基础
we have the foundation for a big leap forward in user experience

1796
01:42:07,327 --> 01:42:12,332
它可以改变我们的专业用户在 iPad 上工作的方式
one that can change how our Pro users get work done on iPad

1797
01:42:12,366 --> 01:42:14,801
所以我们把台前调度
So we're bringing Stage Manager

1798
01:42:14,835 --> 01:42:18,539
就是你刚刚在 macOS 上看到的最新窗口系统
our latest windowing system that you just saw in macOS, to iPadOS

1799
01:42:18,572 --> 01:42:20,040
引入到了 iPadOS

1800
01:42:20,073 --> 01:42:24,144
台前调度把 iPad 上的多任务处理提升到了一个全新的水平
Stage Manager takes multitasking on iPad to a whole new level

1801
01:42:24,178 --> 01:42:29,416
让它变得更加快捷也解锁了对外接显示器的全面支持
by making it more nimble and unlocking full external display support

1802
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:31,218
我现在就展示给你们看
I'd like to show it to you now

1803
01:42:32,819 --> 01:42:34,988
迄今在 iPad 上当你使用 app 的时候
Today on iPad, when you use apps

1804
01:42:35,022 --> 01:42:38,325
它们会以我们熟悉的全屏方式打开
you get the full screen experience that we're all familiar with

1805
01:42:38,358 --> 01:42:40,194
就像这里的照片一样
like in Photos here

1806
01:42:40,227 --> 01:42:44,531
激活台前调度之后我现在就可以调整窗口的大小
With Stage Manager activated, I can now resize windows

1807
01:42:44,565 --> 01:42:48,669
这为在 iPad 上使用 app 提供了一种强大的新方式
exposing a powerful new way to work with apps on iPad

1808
01:42:48,702 --> 01:42:52,673
程序坞也触手可及所以我可以轻松访问所有的 app
And the Dock is visible, so I can easily get to all my apps

1809
01:42:52,706 --> 01:42:54,741
让我们打开音乐 app
Let's open Music

1810
01:42:54,775 --> 01:42:58,178
你会注意到所有我最近用过的 app 都显示在左边
You'll notice that all my recently used apps appear on the left

1811
01:42:58,212 --> 01:43:01,048
在它们之间可以快速切换
so switching between them is really fast

1812
01:43:01,081 --> 01:43:04,618
台前调度为我提供了出色的全新布局功能
And Stage Manager gives me powerful new layout capabilities

1813
01:43:04,651 --> 01:43:07,187
让我可以创造出我理想的工作空间
to create my ideal workspace

1814
01:43:07,221 --> 01:43:11,592
在 iPad 上我第一次可以在重叠窗口中工作
For the first time on iPad, I can work with overlapping windows

1815
01:43:11,625 --> 01:43:16,730
我现在要把信息 app 拖到日历 app 旁边
I'm gonna drag Messages alongside Calendar here

1816
01:43:16,763 --> 01:43:20,033
而当我把信息 app 拖到屏幕中间时
and Stage Manager automatically moves Calendar gently off to the side

1817
01:43:20,067 --> 01:43:21,902
台前调度会自动把日历轻轻移动到旁边
as I bring it to the stage

1818
01:43:21,935 --> 01:43:25,372
如果我把信息 app 移动到屏幕左边
And if I move Messages to the left

1819
01:43:25,405 --> 01:43:29,910
台前调度也会自动为日历 app 改变位置
Stage Manager repositions Calendar for me automatically

1820
01:43:29,943 --> 01:43:32,779
而且就像你之前看过的那样我可以调整窗口的大小
And like you saw earlier, I can resize windows

1821
01:43:32,813 --> 01:43:36,383
按照我想要的方式安排所有内容
and arrange everything just the way I want

1822
01:43:36,416 --> 01:43:40,120
而当我把 iPad 连接到外接显示器的时候
And it gets even better

1823
01:43:40,153 --> 01:43:42,122
这些功能会更强大
when I plug my iPad into an external display

1824
01:43:43,857 --> 01:43:47,261
我的墙纸可以完美地填充整个屏幕
My wallpaper beautifully fills the entire display

1825
01:43:47,294 --> 01:43:51,098
我也可以把光标从 iPad 移动到屏幕上
and I can move my cursor to it from my iPad

1826
01:43:51,131 --> 01:43:55,169
我在这个显示屏上也可以访问程序坞现在让我们打开 Keynote 讲演
I have the Dock here too, so let's go ahead and launch Keynote

1827
01:43:55,202 --> 01:43:58,405
这时我就在一个更大的空间内
When I do, I once again enter Stage Manager

1828
01:43:58,438 --> 01:44:01,241
再次进入了台前调度
now on an even bigger canvas

1829
01:44:01,275 --> 01:44:03,944
这些额外的屏幕空间
All of that additional screen real estate is so useful

1830
01:44:03,977 --> 01:44:06,580
在用 Keynote 处理演示文稿的时候非常有用
when working on a presentation in Keynote

1831
01:44:06,613 --> 01:44:09,082
而且当你需要用一组 app 来工作的时候它也能完美应对
And it's amazing when you're working with a set of apps

1832
01:44:09,116 --> 01:44:13,854
我可以创建有三个甚至四个窗口的组
I can create groups of three and even four windows

1833
01:44:13,887 --> 01:44:16,123
它的功能非常强大
This is just incredibly powerful

1834
01:44:16,156 --> 01:44:19,026
结合我的 iPad 和外接显示器
Between my iPad and my external display

1835
01:44:19,059 --> 01:44:23,130
我最多可以同时使用 8 个 app
I can have up to eight apps running onscreen simultaneously

1836
01:44:23,163 --> 01:44:28,235
而且我还可以利用这些显示器的独特功能
And I can take advantage of the unique capabilities of each of these displays

1837
01:44:28,268 --> 01:44:31,205
例如我正在处理这个 Keynote 演讲文档
For instance, I'm working on this Keynote document

1838
01:44:31,238 --> 01:44:34,541
而这时我想添加一张用 Procreate 画的图
and I want to add a drawing from Procreate

1839
01:44:34,575 --> 01:44:37,845
在我的 iPad 上
here on my iPad

1840
01:44:37,878 --> 01:44:41,515
我可以用 Apple Pencil 来为我的绘图
I can use Apple Pencil to add a finishing touch

1841
01:44:41,548 --> 01:44:43,417
完成最后的点睛之笔
to my drawing

1842
01:44:48,255 --> 01:44:51,024
现在我可以回到图库
And now I can jump back into the gallery

1843
01:44:51,058 --> 01:44:56,263
把显示器里的绘图拖过来直接放进我的演示文稿中了
and then drag and drop across displays and into my deck

1844
01:44:56,296 --> 01:45:00,367
以上就是对台前调度的简短介绍
And that's a quick look at Stage Manager

1845
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:04,671
它带来了一种全新的多任务处理方式提供多个窗口的重叠
It's an entirely new way to multitask with multiple overlapping windows

1846
01:45:04,705 --> 01:45:08,208
灵活的窗口设定快速的 app 切换
flexible window sets, fast app switching

1847
01:45:08,242 --> 01:45:11,278
以及对外接显示器的全面支持
and full external display support

1848
01:45:11,311 --> 01:45:14,147
这就是 iPadOS 16
And that's iPadOS 16

1849
01:45:14,181 --> 01:45:17,985
这次重大发布为许多内置 app 带来了超棒的更新
a big release with exciting updates to many of the built-in apps;

1850
01:45:18,018 --> 01:45:20,087
为 iPad 引入了天气 app

1851
01:45:20,120 --> 01:45:22,856
带来了进行协作和提供生产力的新方式

1852
01:45:22,890 --> 01:45:26,560
为专业级用户带来了包括台前调度在内的众多新功能
