1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,680
Hello and welcome to a brand-new
series

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,160
of Bake Off: The Professionals.

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,320
Our first set of heats are about to
begin.

4
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,640
I can't wait. And let's hope our
first six teams go all out,

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:12,840
because after two testing
challenges,

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,480
somebody will be going home.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,760
Going home? Oh, don't worry, Liam -
it's not going to be you this time.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,560
You've got a new role to play now.

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,000
So does that mean that I make it all
the way to the final?

10
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:23,120
Yes, Liam, absolutely!

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,360
Oh, cool. Cos last time, I was
robbed, you know.

12
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,440
Oh, I know.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,920
12 teams of incredibly talented
pastry chefs

14
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:32,520
are about to take part in the
most spectacular

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:35,160
professional bake off Britain has
ever seen.

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,400
It feels amazing, doesn't it?
Terrifying!

17
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,360
Each week, they will have to create
hundreds of exquisite cakes and

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,040
pastries and then construct

19
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,880
incredible towering showpieces
made entirely

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,200
of delicately-sculpted sugar and
chocolate.

21
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,920
It's a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity.

22
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,440
Hopefully, we get to go further.

23
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:58,040
Yeah? Yeah?

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,720
Everything they create will be
judged

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,240
by two of the world's most respected
patissiers - Benoit Blin...

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,040
I am losing that kid's pleasure of
snapping your teeth into this.

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,560
..and Cherish Finden.

28
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,440
It is so sensational.

29
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,000
I've got to cha-cha-cha.

30
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,640
Ooh, it's beautiful.

31
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:18,840
Go, go, go, go, go.

32
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,680
There is no hiding away.
Patisserie is an art.

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,880
Avant-garde?

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,040
Any mistake that they
put on the plate,

35
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,960
I will spot it immediately.

36
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:33,000
At the end of each demanding week,
one team...

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,840
Oh, BLEEP! ..will be sent home.

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,080
I am scared for them.

39
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,280
But which of our 12 teams
can hold their nerve?

40
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,640
That intense enough? And who will
push themselves furthest?

41
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,800
Don't cry. As they fight to be
crowned champions...

42
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,320
Do you think it is going to hold?

43
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,240
I've got faith in you.
THEY LAUGH

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,520
BLEEP.

45
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,560
..of Bake Off: The Professionals.

46
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,600
GROANING

47
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,280
Over the next two days,

48
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,120
our first six teams of professional
pastry chefs

49
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,800
will face two challenges...

50
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Good luck.

51
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,120
Are you ready?

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,560
..after which they will be ranked,

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,160
and whoever comes last will have to
leave.

54
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,560
I know they say, like, "Go."

55
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,520
We don't need to, like, run off. We
just need to get our recipe out and,

56
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,600
like... Yeah. ..discuss for a
second, I think.

57
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,040
Good morning, chefs, and welcome to
Bake Off: The Professionals.

58
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,960
Which, according to the judges,

59
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,760
is Britain's toughest patisserie
competition.

60
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,640
We start today with
miniature classics,

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,800
a high-volume test of
two standards of pastry.

62
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,280
And the judges have told me if you
cannot deliver on this,

63
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,600
they will be sorely disappointed.

64
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,240
Not angry, just disappointed.

65
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,960
Well, Cherish will be angry,
but that's just Cherish.

66
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,480
So, judges, can you tell us what
you have chosen for the teams?

67
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,680
I have chosen tarte aux fruits.

68
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:10,440
You may use any fruit you like,
however,

69
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,240
your 24 tarts must be delicious and
highly finished.

70
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,040
Benoit, can you tell us what you've
chosen?

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,960
Yes, Tom, I've chosen a... FRENCH
PRONUNCIATION: ..conversation.

72
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,600
Do you mean "conversation"?
No, no, I mean conversation.

73
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,840
What does it mean in English?

74
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:24,560
ENGISH PRONUNCIATION: Conversation.

75
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,480
Well, that was a wonderful...
FRENCH PRONUNCIATION:
..conversation.

76
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,280
This is a little French tart
consisting of puff pastry,

77
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:36,200
frangipane or almond cream, jam and
finished off with royal icing.

78
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,960
I need to see 24 from each team.

79
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,560
Chefs, you have three-and-a-half
hours, and your time starts now.

80
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,560
Oh, BLEEP!

81
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,120
Let's do it.

82
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:50,640
It is crucial that the
team do well with this first

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,520
challenge. Cherish and I have made
it tight with time.

84
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,920
We want to find out how those
professionals

85
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
can be pushed with their

86
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,360
time management to deliver
incredible flavours

87
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,400
and flawless presentation across
large batches of miniatures.

88
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:11,280
What I want to see on a tarte aux
fruits is a beautiful velvet pastry

89
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:14,240
of smooth, aerated creme patissiere.

90
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,160
The fruit has to be beautifully
presented.

91
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,240
We want the team to run free with
their imagination.

92
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,640
Morning, Marta,
morning, Julie.

93
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,120
Morning. Morning, chef.

94
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,640
You are going at it like you want it
done very quickly.

95
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,040
So what are we preparing now?

96
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
So I am preparing the pate sucree
for the fruit tarts.

97
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,080
Pate suc...?

98
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,840
Pate sucree. Pate sucree. My French
isn't great - I do apologise.

99
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,440
No, that is fine. In English,
you could say sweet pastry.

100
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,440
It's fine, that's quicker.

101
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,920
Julie and Marta from the independent
Bom Bom Patisserie in Loughborough

102
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:47,400
met at catering college, where Julie
was Marta's tutor.

103
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,040
Brazilian-born Marta is blending a
classic British rhubarb and custard

104
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,080
with strawberries,

105
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,880
surrounded by a time-consuming
glaze dome of yoghurt mousse.

106
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,760
I will need the tarts baked
so I can start assembling it.

107
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,480
Nothing is going to be delayed,
Marta.

108
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,920
Nothing is going to be delayed!
Shall we let them crack on?

109
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,040
You do not want a go, then?

110
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,720
Oh, no, no, no! I want a go,
I want a go.

111
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,000
BENOIT: A team of three now!

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,200
No, too many waves. Thank you.

113
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,200
Get going.

114
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,960
Is that why I lost the
other Bake Off?

115
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,800
THEY LAUGH

116
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,640
# Get into the groove

117
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,640
# Boy, you gotta move... #

118
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,280
Rebekah and Michael's tarte aux
fruits

119
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,760
has been inspired by their love of
a song. And one or two drinks.

120
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,880
We like to relax with a pina colada.

121
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:30,800
If you are after a tipple, our
table's the one.

122
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,080
# Hold me close and don't let go...
#

123
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,000
Michael and Rebekah's combined
talent

124
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,040
has helped St David's in Cardiff

125
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,600
become the city's only
five-star hotel.

126
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,280
Their pina colada tartes aux fruits
will have a coconut and rum mousse,

127
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,120
lime caviar and a pipette of
rum caramel syrup.

128
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,360
The best pastry chefs in Cardiff -
is that correct?

129
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,560
Well, slightly big-headed, but,
yeah, go on. If you have said it,
not us...

130
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,000
Well, that is what I heard. Word on
the street is... I like your voice,
Rebekah.

131
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,000
She is a Valleys girl. So I'm from
Tonypandy, the Rhondda Valley.

132
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,760
Tonypandy? Tonypandy. That sounds
like something you should be putting
in this tart.

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,440
And where are you from, Michael?

134
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,000
I am from a little town called
Bargoed, which is... Bargoed?

135
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,280
Yeah. That doesn't sound
like it should be in a dessert.

136
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,000
Definitely not - trust me.

137
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,120
For Hideko and Theo's
tarte aux fruits,

138
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,360
inspiration has come from a little
further afield than a nightclub in
Cardiff.

139
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,520
Sorry, love.

140
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,760
Hideko runs her own bespoke pastry
business, the SweetArt Lab,

141
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,400
where Theo helps bring her
incredible creations to life.

142
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:32,720
She has designed a rainbow tarte aux
fruits

143
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,280
that includes another Japanese
ingredient.

144
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,720
Shiso. It's a Japanese green herb.

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,480
It is not like a basil, it's not
like a mint... It's in between.

146
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,000
Do you know that
I grow shiso at home?

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,720
I put it by my window and it is
amazing.

148
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,160
We eat it with rice, don't we?

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
Yeah, exactly!

150
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,080
You don't smoke it, no?

151
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,240
No.

152
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:56,680
To fill their tartes aux fruits,
Chris and BJ are going even further.

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,880
We are using sea buckthorn in our
creme patissiere.

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
It's a berry that grows by the sea.

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,880
It is very sharp.
It is almost like sherbet.

156
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,200
Ordinarily, it is poisonous, but
once it is cooked up,

157
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,760
it's got a really amazing flavour.

158
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,720
What is life without a little bit of
danger?

159
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,360
See what else we can find and
then we can head back. Yeah.

160
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,480
BJ and Chris often forage for
ingredients

161
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,440
to take back to the kitchen at
the critically-acclaimed

162
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,440
Warren restaurant in Tunbridge
Wells.

163
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,800
Bear Grylls is one of my biggest
heroes.

164
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,600
I love him. He's not going to watch
this.

165
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,800
I don't care.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
Their tartes aux fruits
will feature mango,

167
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,520
coconut meringue and a sea buckthorn
gel.

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
And their potentially poisonous
ingredient has already had a lethal

169
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
effect on their creme patissiere.

170
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,320
That has immediately split.

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
I think the puree has split with the
cream.

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Okey dokey. I am feeling weirdly
calm,

173
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,000
but I'm sure that's going to
change.

174
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,400
The boys from the Warren aren't the
only team beginning to discover

175
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,800
just how difficult this first
challenge is.

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
One hour. Nearly an hour gone,
Hideko.

177
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,400
Have to push now.

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,640
Yeah. Julia, the tart in the oven
already.

179
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
There are about to go in.

180
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
With tart cases baking,

181
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
every remaining minute will need to
be carefully scheduled.

182
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,720
They need enough time for the cases
to cool before they can fill them...

183
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,040
This needs to hurry up, like.

184
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,200
..and their fillings need to set
early enough...

185
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,200
Doing my yoghurt mousse.

186
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,360
..to leave enough time for
decoration.

187
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,080
We are not there yet. I think we're
going to run out of time.

188
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,880
If I start running around and
crying, that'll be the telltale
sign.

189
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
It's getting warmer in here, isn't
it?

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,680
Time could be the least of
Darryl and Bharat's worries.

191
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
So we have a German sweet paste.

192
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,600
It's an eggless. It's a great
pastry.

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,800
Do you guys normally go against
using eggs in your recipes?

194
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
I'm a actually allergic to egg.

195
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,480
Ah! You're allergic to eggs?

196
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,240
I am, yes. Do you do the tasting?

197
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
I do the tasting. Ah, there we go.

198
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,200
Darryl lives with his family in
Cornwall,

199
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,400
but commutes to Birmingham

200
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,240
where he and Bharat create high-end
desserts at Resorts World.

201
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,320
Their tart will have a vanilla
creme patissiere and a white

202
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,080
chocolate-glazed mango mousse,

203
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,240
neither of which Darryl has ever
tasted.

204
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,800
Mistakes have happened and I have
ended up in hospital.

205
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,600
The doctors did say, "Give it up,
you could end up killing yourself."

206
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,520
I did go away and think about it for
a minute..

207
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,680
..then just decided to carry on

208
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,040
cos it's something I love doing.

209
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,240
Sam and Emmanuel are also facing a
mortal enemy...

210
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,040
We have decided to go a totally
different way,

211
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,840
rethinking the way we are presenting
it.

212
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,280
..themselves.

213
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,880
We are going to do a mango
and passion mousse.

214
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,840
Then I am going to make a strawberry
and lime jelly to go in the middle.

215
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,520
And once that is frozen, cut them
out,

216
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,120
dip them in a passion fruit
cocoa butter.

217
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,320
A former finalist,

218
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,800
Sam is returning to the competition
with his boss, Emmanuel,

219
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,920
head pastry chef of the five-star
Hilton Park Lane in London.

220
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:40,280
As well as a triple-layered mousse,
they are heading six types of fruit,

221
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,200
strawberry chocolate feathers and
gold leaf for a vertical tart.

222
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,280
We try and take all the flavours
that you would normally find but

223
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:50,440
transform them into something quite
modern.

224
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,000
Feeling a bit under pressure
but still confident.

225
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
Chefs, you are halfway through.

226
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,120
BLEEP! We're behind.

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,120
If creating 24 flawless tartes aux
fruits wasn't demanding enough...

228
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,480
Freeze them. ..the teams have
another pastry to complete -

229
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840
Benoit's...

230
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,920
I remember, when I was little,
going into those bakeries

231
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,040
and falling in love with those
beautiful, golden, round tarts.

232
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,440
Traditionally, a conversation has a
puff pastry case

233
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,200
filled with raspberry
jam, almond cream, or frangipane,

234
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,880
topped with puff pastry,

235
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,360
royal icing and a puff pastry
diamond decoration.

236
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,280
If any of the teams are brave enough
to add their own twist,

237
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:39,760
it has to enhance the pastry I loved
as a boy.

238
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,160
Chris. Even though they have already
ruined their schedule...

239
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
I reckon even slightly more
sea buckthorn.

240
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
Yeah, put it in.

241
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,200
..Chris and BJ could now ruin
Benoit's childhood dreams.

242
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
The modern conversation...

243
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,880
A modern conversation?!

244
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,960
..is made with sweet pastry and
not puff pastry.

245
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,440
FUNEREAL BELL TOLLS

246
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,280
We are using a rough puff pastry
base

247
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,640
and then we have capped that
with the sweet paste. Why?

248
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Because we were having so much
trouble with the puff pastry

249
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
not rising the way we wanted it.

250
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,040
Shock it.

251
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,720
Hey, let's learn and live.

252
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,680
I hope so. Or live and learn. Yeah!

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,120
Learn and leave?

254
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
Learn and leave.

255
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,360
Practising recreating this classic
hasn't suited Theo and Hideko's

256
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
artistic side.

257
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,960
I tried a fast one. Good luck -
it went well.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,440
The second collapsed!

259
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080
It was a disaster!

260
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,960
Boil, boil, boil, boil.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
Do you want to just taste this?

262
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
And already coping with Daryll's egg
allergy...

263
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
Have you got vanilla in there? Does
it need more?

264
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
It needs more vanilla, yeah.
..Bharat now faces another obstacle.

265
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,880
How do you feel about making
conversation?

266
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
You're doing great now. This is a
great... FRENCH PRONUNCIATION:
..conversation.

267
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,720
I haven't really made before.
Is that a good thing? Not for a
competition, no.

268
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,800
I mean, it's basically a
Bakewell tart, isn't it?

269
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,560
It's a fancy name for... Yeah, I
think so.

270
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,360
That's how I felt about it when
Benoit was going ON about it.

271
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,320
The passion and mango mousse
has been frozen.

272
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
As well as a worryingly ambitious
tarte aux fruits...

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
I made an aga jelly.

274
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,000
Aga sets fast, so makes sense for a
competition like this.

275
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
..Sam and Emmanuel have found a way
to make the conversations'

276
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,000
beautifully simple fillings
a bit more complicated.

277
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
To the jam, we have added a little
bit of calamansi...

278
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,040
Ooh... ..which is a citrus.

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,960
I grew up with this lime.
It's a small, little, tiny lime.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,080
Very intense, its flavour.

281
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,160
Hopefully, it won't take over the
raspberry, which is a risk.

282
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,960
Even if the teams are happy with
both their conversation fillings...

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,200
It is a lot of French beurre.

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
Let's do half. Yeah? Yeah.

285
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,080
..multitasking in this first
challenge

286
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,600
is about to get much harder.

287
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,760
Your mousses are frozen. Sweet!

288
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,280
As well as ensuring all their tarte
aux fruits elements are on track...

289
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,520
The quicker it gets in the blast,
the better it is.

290
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
I need to try and cut out of this,
and if it is too soft,

291
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
it's going to be a nightmare.

292
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,360
..the conversations have to be
filled and built...

293
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,800
# Oh, you've got to move... #

294
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,480
..with enough time remaining for
them to bake correctly.

295
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,640
We can do this, babes. We can claw
this time back now.

296
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,600
Vous avez une heure!

297
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,800
Une heure!

298
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,880
I don't even know if that...
Is that how you say it?

299
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,600
Probably doesn't mean that.

300
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,720
Probably means, "You have left
something on the sideboard."

301
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
We have an hour to have everything
done.

302
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,040
Definitely going to be tight.

303
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
Perspiring a lot now.

304
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,640
Nice.

305
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,920
SHE COUNTS IN PORTUGUESE

306
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
The finish on the conversations
is what I'm most worried about,

307
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,320
to make sure they all look neat and
tidy.

308
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,280
Too small. They have got to go in
the oven in the next 15 minutes.

309
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,840
We need to get these in the oven.

310
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,200
How long have we got left?

311
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,120
46 minutes.

312
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,080
Got frangipane all over my glasses.

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
I don't like conversations.

314
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,880
The simpler you keep it, the more
perfect you need to have it.

315
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,680
Just covering the conversations with
royal icing.

316
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,600
They take 25 minutes to cook, so...

317
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
They need to be going in in the next
six minutes.

318
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,760
I think you're being a bit
overambitious. OK.

319
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,520
And then, Emmanuel, put very thin
strips of puff pastry on the top.

320
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,520
That will create the cracks in the
icing when it cooks.

321
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,240
Give me a hand. We need to finish
this.

322
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,640
43 minutes. Otherwise, it won't
get out.

323
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,080
It's boiling, man, it is boiling.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

324
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,640
Putting it on top to stop the
colouring too much.

325
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,840
Otherwise, it's going to be very
dark.

326
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,040
Benoit did expect some pastry on
top,

327
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,040
but we just score over them with
butter.

328
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,120
Must be almost there.

329
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,160
While Chris and BJ are
beginning to make up time...

330
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
Yeah.

331
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,080
..Hideko and Theo are starting
to struggle...

332
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
Half an hour. ..and they are not
alone.

333
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
BLEEP!

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,400
The mousse is slightly thicker
than we wanted it.

335
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,400
Bit of a sweaty mess at the moment.

336
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,560
Hideko, put them now or they
won't be... Yeah.

337
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,880
These are going in the oven.

338
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
BUTTONS BEEP

339
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,720
Right then, babs, what's next?

340
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,880
The fruit tart.

341
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,080
One, two, three.

342
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,280
One, two, three.

343
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,560
MIXER WHIRS

344
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,960
Glaze. We'll add a bit of red to
it. Come on!

345
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,840
Sam's mousses will now need
to be shaped by hand...

346
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,520
We need to adjust. Trim the baton.

347
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,680
..which will take time.

348
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,520
It's a little messy.

349
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,200
I'm making the lime caviar to go on
the fruit tart.

350
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,040
A mixture of lime juice, sugar,
agar-agar.

351
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Just drop it into cold oil.

352
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,120
As a child, I was always given the
juice drink Five Alive.

353
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
That's what it reminds me of.

354
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,680
You are left with little lime balls,
so to speak.

355
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,960
And then, reminds me a little bit of
Grotbags.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
Back to the blast.

357
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,960
He has reshaped his mousses...

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
Oh, BLEEP!

359
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,560
..but now Sam's put them on a tray
that is too big to go back into the

360
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,680
blast chiller. What's the
problem, the tray?

361
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,400
I'm getting very, very tense.

362
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,560
18 minutes. Last push. Yeah.

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
I'm sweating my BLEEP off.

364
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,160
Are they all right?

365
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,320
So what else is left to do for that
tart? Build!

366
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,160
I am glazing it with an
orange glaze,

367
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
which gives it a bit more
citrus flavour.

368
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,720
How long we got?

369
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,400
Chefs, you have 15 minutes.

370
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
We're on the Bobby Ball. Yeah.

371
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,040
Rock on, Tommy, over here.

372
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,600
They look a little bit sort of
scruffy.

373
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,320
I'm going to do 35 feathers.

374
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,680
Super nice.

375
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
I'm just piping our sea buckthorn
pastry cream.

376
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
That's six minutes.

377
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,600
We are going to be just on time.

378
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
Cocoa butter's cutting well.

379
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
When you're dipping something that's
frozen, chocolate reacts instantly.

380
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,960
How many minutes do we have?

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,440
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

382
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,280
# Do you like pina coladas...? #

383
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,920
Oh, bugger! Are they hot, by any
chance?

384
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,600
I want to jump on to my
conversations.

385
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,320
Some of them have just exploded.

386
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
They are looking a bit rough.

387
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,560
MIXING DROWNS SPEECH

388
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,720
This is what it
looks like when Kermit has babies.

389
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
Overstuffed.

390
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,240
I don't care, as long as we get them
out.

391
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,920
Some of the rum has leaked out of
these pippettes. Passion fruit.

392
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,480
Chefs, you have one minute until
your miniature classics

393
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
must be served.

394
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,040
Every second's important now.

395
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,360
Oh, come on, come on, come on. We've
got time, haven't we?

396
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,880
Yeah. Try not to put too much gold
on, mate.

397
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,200
Oh, BLEEP things man.

398
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,800
Come on, you little bugger.

399
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
SHE COUNTS

400
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
OK, chefs, time's up.

401
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,000
Please, step away from your tarts.

402
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,840
The time goes a lot quicker than you
think.

403
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,840
Best thing is...didn't need to pee.

404
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,320
No, I don't really
need to pee either.

405
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,360
The teams will now face the
judgment of Benoit and Cherish

406
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
for the very first time.

407
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,440
This is terrifying, init?

408
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
BLEEP!

409
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,200
Hilton Park Lane, please come up
to the table to be judged.

410
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,600
They look pretty close
to what I remember.

411
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,960
It's a nice, full tart.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
The calamondin...
HE BLOWS RASPBERRY

413
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,000
I would have rather raspberry on it.

414
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,440
Let's try the fruit tart.
They look very sexy.

415
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
You've dusted a little bit
of gold dust on it as well.

416
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,960
It just lifts up the whole thing.

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,320
Well done, chef. Thank you.

418
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,400
Flavour-wise,
I've got a lot of acid,

419
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,760
nothing really interesting
coming out of it.

420
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,040
It's so heavy over here,
it's just too much agar.

421
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,760
Thank you very much. Thank you.

422
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
Conversation - as far as
the finishing is concerned,

423
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,240
because you didn't put any pastry on
the top, we see the almond cream.

424
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,080
The good part is the almond cream,
obviously, is baked nicely.

425
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,240
However, the execution is poor.

426
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
What about the fruit tart?

427
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,080
Your glaze is beautiful,
it's smooth.

428
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,960
We've got the strawberry,
pineapple, mango,

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,920
but it doesn't go anywhere special.

430
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
It's a bit flat. OK.

431
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,080
Does it excite me? Not really.

432
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,800
The pastry feels thick
and it's not flaky.

433
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,880
But you've moved the fruit tart
to a different level.

434
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,400
Oops!

435
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,320
Yoghurt mousse doesn't excite me.
It tastes of yoghurt.

436
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
And I get a little bit of rhubarb,
but very light.

437
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,160
So I don't think it's a fruit tart,
I think it's a yoghurt tart.

438
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,880
The conversation - the royal icing
on the top

439
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,440
doesn't look very appealing, so...
HE BLOWS RASPBERRY

440
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,680
I will not eat the pastry. As you
can see, that's raw -

441
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,520
that will give me tummy ache
tonight.

442
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,840
My heart was broken...

443
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,400
..because we were talking about
the glaze with the shisho.

444
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,040
But when I look at the fruit,
it's just so dry.

445
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,160
You lost control completely. Yeah.

446
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,080
This is the little crisscross
pattern I'm looking for.

447
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,440
But obviously we've got
a few puffed up.

448
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,800
A conversation doesn't
have to puff up.

449
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,080
Ah! It looks full -
and that's important!

450
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,120
The amount of icing you've got on
the top, which is a bit short.

451
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,840
I'm losing that kid's pleasure of
snapping your teeth into this.

452
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,080
And the baking,
not perfect, but pleasant.

453
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,760
I'm very happy with pleasant!

454
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,720
LAUGHTER

455
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,720
Looking at your fruit tartlets,

456
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,200
I need sunglasses
to look at your caviar.

457
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,760
I can't bear the look of
so much colour.

458
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,640
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

459
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
What do I do with the bottle?

460
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,280
Over the top.
It's a coconut rum caramel.

461
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,640
I'm not sure if that's good or bad.

462
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,920
I like it.

463
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,840
I said it, I said it -
I like it!

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
I love pineapples,
so you got my sweet spot there.

465
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,080
OK.

466
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,680
I don't like it...

467
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,120
..I love it!

468
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,520
It's so tasty, oh, my goodness.

469
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,760
Now your knees are going soft.
I'm getting...!

470
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,960
Well, I tell you what, the caviar
is really, really acidic,

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,480
and it blends very well
with every element.

472
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,440
And this that you drizzle on -
sensational.

473
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,800
Thank you, thank you very much.

474
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
That's nice. Oh, yeah.

475
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,000
I wasn't expecting that.
It was half and half.

476
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,320
I really wasn't expecting that.

477
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
The Warren, please come forward.

478
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,040
It's like a wedding, isn't it?

479
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,520
Have we got 24?
You do not. you've got 18.

480
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,200
Oh, they only did 18!

481
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,280
I don't believe you were
particularly rushing,

482
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,800
or you didn't behave like you were.
Yeah.

483
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,640
You were standing around
doing nothing.

484
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,360
Firstly, the casing is uncooked.
I can't eat that.

485
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,280
And the cream is dull, it's boring,
it's not to my liking.

486
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,280
Sorry, can't eat it.

487
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,480
Well, most of it has been said,

488
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,520
except the sea buckthorn flavour
is one I like.

489
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,880
As far as the conversation
is concerned, it has exploded.

490
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
Yeah. But, yeah...is it baked? Yep.

491
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,040
Nope! It isn't.

492
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,360
Where is the almond cream?
It hasn't baked correctly.

493
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm a bit disappointed.

494
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,840
If I'm a professional chef, you
bring this up into the competition,

495
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
I'll be so embarrassed.

496
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
Wow...

497
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,120
Can't really say anything.
We just got destroyed.

498
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,240
Maybe we have been
a bit too relaxed.

499
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,840
Slightly soul-destroying, but not
going to let it kill the vibe.

500
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,440
Tomorrow's second challenge is on
such a grand scale that the teams

501
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,840
have been given a golden hour to
prepare any elements that need

502
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,360
setting overnight.

503
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
Who's impressed so far?
My little colleagues from Wales

504
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,240
from St David's Hotel.

505
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
They prepared, they rehearsed,

506
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
so they didn't underestimate
the competition.

507
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,240
Who is in trouble?

508
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,200
The SweetArt Club.
It's just too ambitious.

509
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,640
Resorts World...?

510
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,440
I think he's playing it very safe.

511
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,520
There's nothing that is exciting.

512
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
But you've got, also,
The Warren team.

513
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,520
If you come for a competition,
you have to be mentally prepared.

514
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,120
A little less conversation,
a little bit more action.

515
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
There's one challenge remaining
before one of our six teams will

516
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
have to leave the competition.

517
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,920
Welcome back, chefs. We all hope
you're all well rested

518
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,640
and prepared for today's
Showpiece Challenge.

519
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,960
Now, this is all about taking an
ordinary dessert

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
and transforming it into
something extraordinary.

521
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,880
And today, the judges would like you
to like you

522
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,160
to transform Black Forest gateau.

523
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,080
So, judges, what are
you looking for?

524
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,480
Well, traditionally,
the dessert features chocolate,

525
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,920
cream and a cherry brandy
called kirsch.

526
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,480
I want those flavours. I want also
to feel nature in your showpieces.

527
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,880
Basically, Benoit wants you to put
enough kirsch in the gateau that

528
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,520
he hallucinates that
he's actually in a forest.

529
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,040
Go big, or you will go home.

530
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,400
Chefs, you have four hours left

531
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760
to complete today's
Showpiece Challenge.

532
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:44,680
Your time starts...now.

533
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
Focus. Let's do this.

534
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,520
Jelly, sponge, Chantilly.

535
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,360
When I was a little kid,
we always used to get

536
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,880
a Black Forest for our birthdays.

537
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,400
It was Sara Lee frozen.

538
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,040
It had to defrost for
about two days

539
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,920
before you could actually get
through it.

540
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,040
Very retro.

541
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,480
Paying tribute to this Germanic
classic will require

542
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,240
enough mouthwatering desserts
to serve 24

543
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:06,600
and an eye-popping edible
sculptural centrepiece.

544
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,360
I'm looking for a work of art here,

545
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,720
showing off a whole range
of techniques.

546
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,720
Plenty of innovation
and a sense of showmanship.

547
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,680
It's very important to get texture
and flavour right.

548
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,040
Every component has to balance
very well with each other.

549
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,640
If the taste is not up to my
standard, it will not be acceptable.

550
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,440
When I've been to
the Black Forest,

551
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,880
it was beautiful.

552
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,120
That is the inspiration
we got it from.

553
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,600
Julie is going to be concentrating
on the tree,

554
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,160
and I'll be doing the entremets.

555
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,680
Comprised of meringue mousse,
cherry compote, joconde sponge,

556
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:46,560
and a chocolate sable biscuit base,
Marta's entremets sharing dessert

557
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,800
will sit at the foot of
Julie's delicate sugar tree.

558
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,200
By mould is flexible PVC
with lots of Sellotape around it.

559
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,640
Blue Peter, eat your heart out!

560
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,800
We've got the estate attached
to the restaurant,

561
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
and I also love spending time
in the forest myself.

562
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,880
For nature lovers Chris and BJ,

563
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,240
this challenge would appear to offer
the perfect chance for redemption.

564
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,400
Bjarni, what the hell are you doing?
Er, I'm... Polishing a stick?

565
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,960
I'm partway through an axe handle.

566
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,400
We're going to have vines coming
sort of down and around the axe,

567
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,360
almost like it's reclaiming...
Overgrown. Overgrown.

568
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,640
I'm a bit confused. So what is your
showpiece? It's just the axe?

569
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,960
It'll be the axe with
the vines coming around

570
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,440
and going down onto the marble.

571
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,360
BJ's chocolate axe will be
surrounded by

572
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,200
individual cherry-shaped desserts in

573
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,400
their final bid to save themselves
from the chop.

574
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,720
Is that going to be
extraordinary enough?

575
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
If it comes out the way
that our vision of it is,

576
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,080
I think it's going to look pretty
impressive.

577
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,480
You don't normally harvests cherries
with an axe, do you?

578
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,160
No. I don't know -
I've never done it.

579
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,720
We're all about deforestation!

580
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,040
# Since we've been together... #

581
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,800
Michael and Rebekah are venturing
even deeper into the forest.

582
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,560
We sort of went
like the forest floor,

583
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,160
sort of eerie but also pretty.

584
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,120
I am going to shave it all down
so it's like a tree root.

585
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,760
We have chocolate soil,
chocolate mushrooms.

586
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,480
We've made the showpiece once.
Once, at one o'clock in the morning.

587
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,680
While eating pizza.
It was very glamorous.

588
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
Beneath Michael's twisted
chocolate branch,

589
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,440
their forest floor will be dotted
with cherry-shaped desserts

590
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,280
featuring a set insert of kirsch
bavarois and a sour cherry gel.

591
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,400
Making sure the structure's
stable and will hold -

592
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,920
that's kind of the biggest part.

593
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,680
Nobody wants it to fall over!

594
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,760
Over-ambition proved to be Emmanuel
and Sam's downfall

595
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,040
in the first challenge - a lesson
they don't seem to have learned.

596
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,800
Because of so many components,
we really have to go for it.

597
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,320
We're making a cuckoo clock.

598
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,800
These turn into a branch.

599
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,240
Those little things over there,
they will turn into birds.

600
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,960
Their cuckoo clock will nestle in
the branches of a chocolate tree.

601
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,800
Beneath it will sit individual
desserts filled with Chantilly,

602
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,040
cherry jelly and
a chocolate fudge sponge.

603
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,320
And just to make things
even more complicated,

604
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,320
they are aiming to make
their chocolate cuckoo sing.

605
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,800
This is a little mechanism which is

606
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,480
going to reproduce the sound of
a bird.

607
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,880
If it doesn't work, Sam will be
doing the singing,

608
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,560
because his singing is
better than mine.

609
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,440
Hoping to avoid an early exit
from the competition...

610
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,960
Just shaving that piece just to get
a nice, smooth edge.

611
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,720
..Darryl and Bharat are avoiding
any conventional connection

612
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,560
with the Black Forest.

613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,120
We're going to have
a oblong shape, tilted.

614
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,120
On the top of that, we'll have
a circle

615
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,760
which will also be at an angle.

616
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
Very abstract piece,
a bit different.

617
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,960
Their bold geometric tower
will provide

618
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,800
the backdrop for three sharing
entremets desserts

619
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
featuring Darryl's eggless
chocolate mousse.

620
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,080
The most important thing is to make
sure you whisk it

621
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
otherwise you end up with
a really grainy mousse.

622
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,040
It should hopefully wow them.

623
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,040
Yesterday, we though
we was going to wow them...

624
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,240
..and obviously didn't!

625
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,720
If Darryl's abstract design
feels like the result of

626
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,080
a night on the kirsch...

627
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,200
It's quite a high risk,
to be honest!

628
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,120
..Hideko's sounds like she may have
lost her marbles.

629
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,760
It's a very popular toy for kids.

630
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,040
OK. Where, in the Black Forest?

631
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,280
In the world. In the world.

632
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,640
Careering down a sugar work slide
will be two sets of edible marbles

633
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,960
which, when combined,

634
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,080
should bring the classic
Black Forest flavours together.

635
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,680
One bite and then the other bite.

636
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,560
We are not supposed to absorb
both marbles at the same time.

637
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,720
Ah, if you have a big mouth,
it's possible.

638
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,600
You'll be like hamster...!

639
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,160
I didn't say that, you did.

640
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,040
Three hours left to secure a place

641
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
in the next round of
the competition.

642
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,680
Watch your backs, please.

643
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,480
I'm going to start building the
entremets and then get it frozen.

644
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,320
Opting for large sharing desserts...

645
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,680
Try and lay it on flat.

646
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,840
..should save Darryl and Marta
precious minutes.

647
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,400
Loads of alcohol,
muffle those taste buds.

648
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,760
I hope they're not driving home.

649
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,840
But for the other teams,
there are dozens of delicate,

650
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,960
individual desserts
to be assembled and set.

651
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,840
This is our mousse, and this is our
chocolate and cherry biscuit.

652
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,840
And we're just going to stick it
together and then mould it.

653
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,600
It's going to be like
a marble shape.

654
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,520
We'll be on time today.
Today, we'll be on time.

655
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,680
I think we're making good
progress today.

656
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,520
You've got a frozen cherry coulis
and Chantilly cream

657
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,760
that we are pushing into
the chocolate mousse.

658
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,520
But while Theo's and Chris' desserts
are ready to begin setting...

659
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,320
Hmm...

660
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,160
..Michael and Rebekah's aren't
even ready to be constructed.

661
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,080
Their kirsch bavarois inserts
have failed to set.

662
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,840
What do you want me to do?
I'm ruining them.

663
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,080
Despite doing well
in the miniature's challenge...

664
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,080
So this was a kirsch mousse inside.

665
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
When we were trying to puff them,
some were breaking.

666
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
..Michael and Rebekah's showpiece
desserts aren't going to plan.

667
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,520
I can see that Rebekah is nervous.

668
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
Run like the wind.

669
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,160
They are making a so-called
tree trunk.

670
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
It could be a bit minimalist.

671
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,040
Pray to the gods. Pray to the gods
and hope for the best.

672
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,040
We are looking for a
magnificent showpiece.

673
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,040
With this, I'm not too sure.

674
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
There is potential for that
simplicity to work also.

675
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,520
What do you think about
Darryl and Bharat?

676
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,720
My concern is mainly
the eggless mousse.

677
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,760
It could be very gummy and sticky.

678
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
The team I am looking forward
to is team Hideko and Theo.

679
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,160
They are taking quite
a bit of risk here,

680
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,320
but if it works that may
be the wow factor.

681
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,920
If it works
I will be catching the dessert.

682
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,600
And I will be rolling
it down for you.

683
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
Are you free to swap jobs me a
second while I check the inserts?

684
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,920
This is the bit where it goes wrong.

685
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,920
Chefs, you have just one hour left.

686
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,120
Time is flying today.

687
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,960
I need to spray everything
and then build.

688
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
We froze them, we are on it.

689
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
Hopefully it will all be cooked.

690
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,120
I'm dipping the little marbles in
white chocolate and cocoa butter.

691
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,200
Lift it up and twist it
for the marble effect.

692
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,720
So we can play marbles after?

693
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,320
Yeah, I'll beat you. No, you won't.
I'm going to roll out.

694
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,760
I've just got to go quickly
blast-chill these.

695
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,960
Is that straight?

696
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,280
Straight?

697
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,440
Every element added...
Is it straight?

698
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
Yes.

699
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,880
..puts additional strain
on already fragile joints.

700
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,200
At the moment it is
really hot in here

701
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,800
so I am not 100% confident
that is going to hold.

702
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
Freeze.

703
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
We need to attach the axe.

704
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
Carefully, carefully.

705
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,840
Do we just chocolate the edges?

706
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
I think so.

707
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,280
And just fill the bottom.

708
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,880
It's too hot.

709
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,760
It's so BLEEP hot in here.

710
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,360
Just 45 minutes left...
Under pressure.

711
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,600
..and now while they try to
complete their constructions...

712
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,760
I'm going to start glazing.

713
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,920
..the teams are running out of time
to de-mould and decorate the
desserts.

714
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
These are our cherries.

715
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,520
We're going to dip them
in that dark glaze. OK.

716
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
The spider glaze is
a glaze on a glaze,

717
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,240
to create a sort of web effect.

718
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,200
That worked.

719
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,880
It is definitely warm in here.

720
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,280
It's not even set yet, is it?

721
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,840
Come on, little one.
Set, set.

722
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,480
BLEEP. Are you all right with that?

723
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
Do you need a hand?
I will need a hand.

724
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,840
Half an hour left, chefs.
Better get a hurry on.

725
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,600
Right. Here we go.

726
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,120
Time is just flying
so you have to be really focused.

727
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,440
You will be OK.
Let's get on with the dessert.

728
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,400
A bit untidy down there, he's
going to mark us off on that.

729
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,080
This is just chocolate glaze. I'm
going to add some shiny powders

730
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,440
on top. Can you have a look to
see if I've missed anything?

731
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,280
One and two there.

732
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
This one is quite heavy.

733
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,680
Oh, no. It's not stood up.

734
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,880
Once I put the shiny glaze on,
it will change them completely.

735
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,200
I need to push it in. Yes.

736
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,960
Carefully, carefully.

737
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,240
Right, we need to pick it up.

738
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
Keep it that way.
Have you got it? Yes.

739
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,240
Hold on, I've got my finger stuck.

740
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
Like a glove.

741
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm going to move it onto the table.

742
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,640
It's going to be fun to slide.

743
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
It made it all of one metre.

744
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,560
As Celine Dion once said,
"This is getting serious."

745
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
It's really hot in here.

746
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,560
You've fallen off. BLEEP.

747
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,240
It's far too hot for this.

748
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
I'm just going to go for it now.

749
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
More up here.

750
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
Nice one.

751
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

752
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
OK, freeze.

753
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,600
OK.

754
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,160
My glasses are falling off.

755
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,440
You have five minutes left.

756
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,160
We need to start putting
things on it.

757
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
Do you reckon you could do
more cherries?

758
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,720
I think it actually looks
better like this.

759
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,200
My hands are too hot,
the chocolate is just melting.

760
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,720
I think they are too heavy.

761
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Put these on here now.

762
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,920
Make sure they are facing
the same way.

763
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,080
Go on, yes, on.

764
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
Michael.

765
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,960
It's extremely hot.

766
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,880
Chefs, that is your time up.

767
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,880
Please step away
from your showpieces.

768
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,160
Six breathtaking Black Forest
showpieces made in just five hours.

769
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,480
Wow. I love the cherry on the top.

770
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,960
That is an amazing cake.

771
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
That is insane.

772
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,840
BLEEP.

773
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,440
BIRD TWEETS

774
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
THEY LAUGH WITH AMAZEMENT

775
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,200
BENOIT: Is he alive? That is mad!

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,560
BENOIT: Definitely some nice little
carving, nice little touches.

777
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,200
My only little regret is this is
lacking brightness.

778
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,400
CHERISH: All your dessert is plated
in an edible plate.

779
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,600
Love it. And also it looks
really appetising.

780
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,480
You thought about how I eat so, when
I cut through,

781
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,960
I have a cherry
and I have the jelly.

782
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
The chocolate mousse
just melts on my palate.

783
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,480
I wish you could have just
a little bit more Chantilly.

784
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,480
I'm lacking the kirsch element.

785
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,400
Lacking, not liking.

786
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,480
The thing with this sponge, though,
there is an undercooked flour taste,

787
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,160
which, because it's clunky,
it feels a bit dry.

788
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,240
I prefer the visual than the
way it tastes like.

789
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,160
Do you know what it reminds me of?

790
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,320
A fishing hook. There's worms
everywhere, look!

791
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
Unfinished business. BOTH: Yeah.

792
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,920
Your cherry mousse, I can't really
taste cherry.

793
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
And I also think that the sponge is
over soaked.

794
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,280
It's just soggy. You've got
mousse and a very soft bavaroise.

795
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,280
It's lacking a little
bit of texture.

796
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,680
I really like the fact that you've
used the 3D mould.

797
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,960
The light penetrates in different
ways

798
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,560
and that gives you those different
shades.

799
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,680
Oh, you like the wobbly wobbly.

800
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,360
Yeah. That tells me your gelatine
is controlled.

801
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,880
If I move and there's no wobble,

802
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,480
that would tell me that your cake
is solid hard.

803
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,160
Thank God for the sable because the
sable brings a little bit

804
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
of crunch and something a little bit
more interesting to play with.

805
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,400
It's very simplistic
but sometimes less is more.

806
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,400
You've definitely used that
to your advantage.

807
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
I really like your cherry.

808
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
It looks so real. It looks
as though it is so sweet.

809
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,040
I really want to tuck in.

810
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,360
I quite like the chocolate mousse.

811
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,080
I think the cherry
is so acidic for me.

812
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,800
The cherry element
takes over everything.

813
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,520
We don't have the flavour profile of
the Black Forest.

814
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
Looks good, but when
you get to eat it,

815
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,880
there is no balance in your dessert.

816
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,360
BLEEP.

817
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,560
I'm looking forward to the
interaction.

818
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,040
I'm going to place it in there

819
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,040
and it should go all
the way down and get

820
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,040
into the plate. Yes, hopefully.

821
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,960
LAUGHTER

822
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,120
On your marks, get set, go!

823
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,960
Wow!

824
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,200
Let's see if it is as fun
to eat as it is to play.

825
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,440
I like it.
The thing is, obviously,

826
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,320
you have to have little bits
at a time

827
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,440
but I can put two little
pieces together.

828
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,520
The kirsch element brings the
Black Forest together so it works.

829
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,000
I think it's really fun.

830
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,320
Would I come back for another?

831
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,200
Perhaps for the fun
but not for the taste.

832
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,560
The alcohol is just too much
for my liking.

833
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,360
A game of two halves.

834
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,040
Well done, thank you. Thank you.

835
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,280
It can be repaired, right?

836
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,080
It's round, it's Square,
it's round...

837
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,360
..and it's still square.

838
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,600
Everything is really solid,
it's very harsh for me.

839
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,320
If it would have been a challenge
on geometrical shapes,

840
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
yes, I got that.

841
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,480
OK. I've got a strong
alcohol flavour.

842
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,880
The sponge has over soaked,
so a very soft, mushy texture.

843
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,720
I would love a little bit more bite.

844
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:24,400
And the chocolate mousse is kind of
tight, it doesn't feel smooth,

845
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,520
and, flavour wise, it's...

846
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,120
..not strong enough.

847
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,480
I was wishing that
you just used pure ingredients.

848
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,520
Simple things sometimes
can be so beautiful.

849
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,280
You add in too much gelatine
in everything.

850
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,520
When I do this, this is bad for me.

851
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:42,680
Everything is just not right in
there. I'm so sorry.

852
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,360
Oh, man. Oh, no.

853
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,640
It's OK.

854
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,800
HE SOBS

855
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:14,320
Based on their performance
on both challenges,

856
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:18,720
Benoit and Cherish will now rank the
teams and those in last place will

857
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,120
have to leave the competition.

858
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,640
It's the impact as well
on the showpiece.

859
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,160
We love what we do.
In fact, we're extremely passionate.

860
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
It was like taking a bullet.

861
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,760
Now, is there a lot of work in it?
Maybe not.

862
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,520
We had a really bad day yesterday.

863
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:34,080
Today wasn't so bad.

864
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
Other teams have had the reverse of
that, so...

865
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,200
It's difficult to say.

866
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,280
Benoit and Cherish
have made their decision.

867
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,320
The judges thought the team in first
place were the most consistent

868
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,520
across both challenges.

869
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,880
Congratulations...

870
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,880
..Emmanuel and Sam
from Hilton Park Lane.

871
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,800
APPLAUSE

872
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,840
In joint second place were Marta and
Julie, and Michael and Rebekah.

873
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:11,120
And, joining them in the next round,
are Hideko and Theo in fourth place.

874
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,840
Which leaves Darryl and Bharat
from Resorts World,

875
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,040
and Chris and Bjarni
from The Warren.

876
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:23,720
After much deliberation, the team
leaving us tonight are...

877
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,760
..Chris and Bjarni.

878
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,640
Congratulations to the rest of you,
we'll see you next week.

879
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:42,120
It would have been hard to see
someone else go.

880
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:46,480
In a way, I am pleased it's us but
it also sucks at the same time.

881
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:48,000
BENOIT: Darryl!

882
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,400
HE WHISTLES

883
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:52,400
They must see that we've got
a little bit more to offer.

884
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:57,600
For something to reduce me to tears,
you know, just shows it means a lot.

885
00:45:57,640 --> 00:45:59,240
Emmanuel, cuddles.

886
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,560
Well done, man.
Next week, new challenge.

887
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:04,560
We will work on it from tomorrow,
I suppose.

888
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:08,800
Or Monday. Let's have a day off at
least. Half a day off.

889
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,680
I'm coming for you, Sam and Emanuel.
Look out, yeah?

890
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,120
Next time... Party time!

891
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,680
..the competition gets hotter...

892
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,720
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

893
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,200
..with two deceptively
simple miniatures.

894
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,800
It cracked! And a classic
French showpiece...

895
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,240
It's the new, modern style.

896
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:25,800
..Fit for the grandest occasion.

897
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,560
But which four teams will survive?

898
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:31,000
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
And whose patisserie dreams...

899
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,080
It weighs a tonne!
..will come crashing down?

900
00:46:33,120 --> 00:46:34,280
SHE EXCLAIMS

901
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:35,720
I'm excited. Thank you.

00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,320
Oh, Liam, I just love our new life
in the countryside.

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:06,080
Well, it's definitely
not Hackney, is it?

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:09,360
Fresh air, lambs running through the
fields, taking tea in the garden!

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,440
Oh, it's just a different pace
of life down here.

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,200
WATCH BEEPS
Oh, Tom. Look at the time,

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,080
we're gonna be late
for the first challenge.

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,560
Oh, no! Oh, no, we mustn't keep
those judges waiting!

8
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,000
Oh, they're so terrifying.

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,440
Come on, Tom! Yeah...

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,080
Tom! Yeah, I'm coming, yeah!

11
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,840
I'm coming, I'm coming! Yeah!

12
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,800
Tom! Sorry, Liam, yeah!

13
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:30,280
MOUTH FULL: Yeah, we mustn't
keep them waiting.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,400
In this toughest of Bake-Offs,
12 talented teams of patissiers

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,600
are vying to be named Britain's
best professional pastry chefs.

16
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,400
Back, back, back, back!
I feel like Picasso now, you know.

17
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,840
Last time...

18
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:45,600
Wow! ..our first six teams...
This is terrifying.

19
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,720
..got a rude awakening.

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,320
BLEEP. Now, boys, we're behind.

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,760
We need to adjust.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Emmanuel and Sam excelled.

23
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,960
Well done, chef.
I'm blown away.

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,160
Darryl and Bharat's
confidence took a knock.

25
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,240
BLEEP. It doesn't
go anywhere special.

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,520
It's a bit flat.
HE SOBS

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,680
It's all right.

28
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,080
But Chris and Bjarni's
relaxed approach...

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,320
I'm feeling weirdly calm.

30
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,240
..got them axed
from the competition.

31
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,040
It's dull, it's boring,
it's not to my liking.

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,160
Now...
Go, go, go, go, go!

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,480
..the teams must reinvent
two classic puddings...

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,160
Ah! It cracked a little bit
as I was rolling it.

35
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,920
..as cutting-edge miniatures.

36
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,240
Are they poisonous?
If you have it too much.

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,040
And transform a traditional
French wedding centrepiece...

38
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,440
They're meant to be that big?

39
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,320
I don't know what
the right answer is!

40
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,520
..into a 21st century showpiece...

41
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,080
BLEEP. Weighs a ton.
..on a monumental scale.

42
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,640
Let's do this. Top, top, top.

43
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,720
Which four teams will stick it out?

44
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,920
BLEEP.

45
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,360
And who will fall apart?

46
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,560
No pressure at all.

47
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,280
Don't cry.

48
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,400
Ready?

49
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,720
As I'll ever be!

50
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,920
When we get comments like last week,
it hurts. It does hurt, yeah.

51
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,920
It does knock you back a bit,
but you've just got

52
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,280
to come back fighting.

53
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,280
Obviously, we came joint second, so
we must have done something right.

54
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,720
So hopefully we can do the same,
if not better, this week.

55
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,160
Back in the game.

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,920
We're gonna try seduction today.

57
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,560
Take Cherish for dinner,
she take Benoit for a drink,

58
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,200
and then that's our strategy today!

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,920
Need to get in the zone.

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,640
Good morning, chefs,
and welcome back to the kitchen.

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,280
We are five today.

62
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,400
But by the end of tomorrow,
only four will remain.

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,200
That's right - one of you will
be eliminated.

64
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,760
Picked off like the weakest gazelle

65
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,000
by two very hungry,
pastry loving wolves.

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000
One of whom happens to be carrying
a ruler.

67
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,240
Today, we begin with
multiple layered slices.

68
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,960
And the judges would like you to
make two types of layered slice,

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,680
24 of each.

70
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,240
So what have you chosen?

71
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,880
I've chosen tiramisu slice.

72
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,920
It must showcase classic coffee
flavour, including ladyfinger.

73
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:13,600
Well, I've chosen
the roulade praline slice,

74
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,200
which must have at least
two different filling

75
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,040
and feature a nutty flavour.

76
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,320
Be creative, but don't forget -

77
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:28,440
we want to see neat, clean layers
across all your slices.

78
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,960
So, chefs, you have 3.5 hours

79
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,600
to complete 48 perfectly
layered slices.

80
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,800
And your time starts...

81
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,840
..now!

82
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,640
I'm gonna put the hazelnuts
to roast first, OK?

83
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,560
In a layered slice,
every single element is visible.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,560
So to succeed,
the teams must combine flair

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,440
in marrying flavours
and textures with precision

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
in layering their components.

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
And Benoit has chosen to try
the teams with a classic,

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,600
named after the French word
"to roll" - the roulade.

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,680
The classical roulade for
a French person

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,880
is the traditional Christmas log.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,680
When I was an apprentice, we
were spending the last week

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,560
before Christmas doing these
every single day.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
Oh, I like it very much.

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
There are many sponges you can use,

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,920
any sponge which will give you
a little bit of elasticity.

96
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,360
But the technicality of the roulade
is being able to roll it

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
nice and circular. You don't want
the roulade to go squarish.

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,880
It may be accepted at home,
but this is a competition.

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,200
There will be nowhere to hide.

100
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,600
Sam and Emmanuel, how are you doing?

101
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,200
Morning, gentlemen. Good morning.

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
Last week's winners,
are you feeling the pressure?

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
Yes, we do. Would you be able to
talk to us about your roulade?

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,040
We kept the basic ingredients.

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
We kept it round, and that's more
or less everything.

106
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,120
So you deconstruct it in a way?

107
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
Yeah, we did.

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,920
LIAM: At the Hilton Park Lane Hotel
in London,

109
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,120
pushing the boundaries of patisserie
is an essential ethos

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
of Emmanuel and Sam's work.

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
For their avant-garde roulade,
Emmanuel and Sam will be

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,720
encasing layers of
hazelnut dacquoise,

113
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,600
nougatine and Mandarin jelly,

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,680
in a hazelnut chocolate mousse.

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
However, they're omitting

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
one notable element

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
of a normal roulade.

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
Let's not beat around the bush.

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,920
Is there any swirl movement
within your roulade?

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,760
It's not like the roulade, which
is round and round and round.

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
So we ask you to do roulade,
but you say, "You know what,

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,000
"sod it..." No, no, no, no. "No more
roulade, we're not doing a roulade."

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,280
We kept the idea of the layers.
So there is no swirl?

124
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,560
Benoit, please let it go!

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
Oh, dear, dear.

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,640
Our touch is a bit too much,
obviously, for the judge.

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
That's... OK.

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,840
I'm under the impression they
think we're a bit too adventurous.

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Whatever they say now
doesn't really affect us.

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,040
We've got to try and do something
different from everybody else.

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,560
It's the only way
you're gonna win.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
After scraping
through the last round...

133
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,240
Do you wanna just taste this?

134
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
More praline. Yeah.

135
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,000
..Darryl and Bharat
are determined to meet

136
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,320
the judges' criticisms head on.

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,760
Last week, we thought they would
have loved the flavours,

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,760
but obviously they didn't.
We're here to impress them today.

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,320
We're just on a mission, basically.

140
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
We will do it.
We can do it, we can do it!

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,160
A black belt in tae kwon do,

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,120
team captain Darryl is no stranger
to getting knocked down

143
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,240
and coming back fighting.

144
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,400
He'll use a white chocolate
hazelnut whip

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,040
and a milk chocolate cream

146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,600
to create a two-tone filling

147
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
to his joconde sponge,

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
which he'll flavour
with vanilla and hazelnut.

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,440
Because of the oils in the nut,

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,640
it makes it quite elastic when it
comes to rolling, shouldn't crack.

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,640
Elasticity will help the chefs to
achieve the desired roulade shape.

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,200
OK? Yeah, I'm good, you?

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
Yeah, good.
But when it comes to texture,

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Hideko and Theo are hoping to take
their sponge to the next level.

155
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,040
The cake part is a souffle base,
like a fluffy, soft sponge cake.

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,840
This sounds like the Japanese sponge
I used to make...

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
Exactly! Ah, I thought so!

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,840
Hideko came to the UK from Japan
15 years ago

159
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,800
to become a pastry chef,
and she's worked with some of the

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,760
biggest names in British cuisine.

161
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,880
First sous-chef to Gordon Ramsay,

162
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,600
and after this, Heston Blumenthal.

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
BLEEP.

164
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Hideko's Japanese souffle sponge

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
will be layered with hazelnut cream

166
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,200
and chopped caramelised hazelnuts.

167
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,280
She's also adding a Chantilly cream

168
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
infused with a novel

169
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,760
dessert flavour.

170
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,080
Cos this is obviously an insert,
I need this to be frozen

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,680
as soon as possible to then
go inside the mousse.

172
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,520
These are gonna go straight in
the blast.

173
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,720
While Sam and Emmanuel's roulade
goes in the blast chiller...

174
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,080
Go, go, go!

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
Julie, we're ready. ..the rest
are ready to go in the oven.

176
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,720
I'll do eight layers
and see how it comes out.

177
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,800
The bake time for the
roulade sponge is crucial.

178
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
I'm putting mine ten.

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
Remember it's on seven minutes
when you close the door, yeah?

180
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,880
Too long in the oven and the sponge
will crack when it's rolled,

181
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,840
making it impossible to get
the all-important spiral.

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,600
Fingers crossed!

183
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,360
With sponges baking...

184
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,880
40 minutes in.

185
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
..it's on to fillings.

186
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
BLEEP.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,120
And Marta and Julie are spicing
theirs with a hint of danger.

188
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,240
I've got my Tonka bean infused cream
in there,

189
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,200
so then I can add it to the ganache.

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,640
Tonka beans, are they poisonous?

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
If you have it too much,
they are poisonous.

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,640
How much would you need
to kill somebody?

193
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,960
I'm asking for a friend.
I don't know.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,920
Team captain Marta opened Bom Bom
Patisserie in Loughborough

195
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,320
two years ago,

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,520
following a career switch
from biologist to baker.

197
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
Her hazelnut joconde sponge will be

198
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,760
filled with two ganaches -

199
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,040
one, a hazelnut whip,

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,960
the other, her chocolate
and tonka bean.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
Is this the texture that
you're looking at?

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
See, that bit is not smooth.

203
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,840
OK. I'm gonna let you
rectify it yourself.

204
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
Mm, nothing stressful about that.

205
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,880
The only stress Michael and Rebekah
are feeling...

206
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,080
THEY SING

207
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,400
..is on their vocal cords.

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
We're definitely more like an old
married couple, do you not think?

209
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,040
Yeah, separate beds.
Yeah, that kind of a married couple!

210
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,960
Friends for nine years,
Michael and Rebekah have spent

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,080
the last two working side-by-side
at the St David's Hotel

212
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,560
in Cardiff.

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
Service, please.

214
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,440
Michael's hazelnut
Pain de Genes sponge

215
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,800
will be covered with
a dark chocolate glaze

216
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,600
and filled with praline ganache

217
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
and a banana mousse.

218
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,080
We've made the banana mousse,
rolled it in clingfilm

219
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,640
to make really long, thin tubes...
There'll be a little bit of

220
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
a surprise inside when
you slice it open.

221
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,800
So this could be the winning bench?

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,000
Joint second. The only way you can
go is higher...

223
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,480
We want first! That's it.

224
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,760
So the insert's surrounded
by the mousse

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,200
and then I'm gonna have a base
to go on the bottom of it.

226
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
That'll need to be cut
a little bit smaller.

227
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,760
Chefs, you have two hours left.

228
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,720
Two hours.

229
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,600
We are on track, hopefully!

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
Can't be worse than last week.

231
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
Two hours to go, yeah? Yeah, yeah.

232
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,120
It's good to get a good hour
and a half in the blast.

233
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,680
The Hilton's roulade
may already be assembled...

234
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
TIMER BEEPS
Right, that's us.

235
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,960
..but for everyone else,
their priority is getting

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,440
their sponges is out of the oven...

237
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
Hot tray here. Yeah.

238
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
Hot, hot, hot.

239
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
..and cool enough to fill and roll.

240
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,680
Get in there, girl!

241
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,440
We'll have time for a cuppa
at this rate!

242
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
That is, if the batch of perfect
roulades wasn't demanding enough,

243
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,880
the teams also need to create
their second layered slice.

244
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,680
Well, you might think that
tiramisu is easy to make

245
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,520
because you can see it everywhere.

246
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,760
However, it is just so difficult
to get right.

247
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,520
The ladyfinger sponge must be
baked to perfection,

248
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,280
so that they can soak up all the
beautiful, intense coffee syrup.

249
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,520
I do not want to see an unsoaked
sponge, it would be so dry.

250
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,320
Then a beautiful,
silky mascarpone cream.

251
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,800
Use just enough gelatine
to hold its form.

252
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,200
Too much gelatine, can you imagine?

253
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,520
It might seem simple,
but it needs to be perfect.

254
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
Theo is creating the tiramisu
for Sweet Art Lab.

255
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,640
We're gonna hopefully keep seeing
all those, like, mountains,

256
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,880
so we have to be really
straight with our shaping.

257
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,320
Word round the kitchen,

258
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,320
you've actually never made
a tiramisu before.

259
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
Not exactly. If my grandparents
hear me, they'll kill me,

260
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,800
because they're Italian
and love tiramisu.

261
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,360
What's that?

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
Does it work with you?

263
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,520
You're pretty hot.

264
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
THEY LAUGH

265
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,400
If you're making a tiramisu,
the first thing you want

266
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
to be hit with is coffee.

267
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,440
But how the chefs introduce
the coffee flavour could prove key.

268
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,320
That is the finest coffee
you can find.

269
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,120
It's Nescafe instant coffee.

270
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,480
Coffee liqueur to give you
that coffee,

271
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
but a little bit of alcohol,
plenty of alcohol kick.

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
That'll be one...

273
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
Basically, we'll put it all in.

274
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
Bottle and a half.

275
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,080
Party time!

276
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
Ladyfinger is ready.

277
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
I'm pretty happy
with my ladyfingers.

278
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
They're crisp, they're dry, so it
actually absorbs the coffee liqueur.

279
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,360
I think the sponge when it's dry,
it can be quite unpleasant.

280
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,480
You can't soak it too much as well,

281
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,800
otherwise your bar is not going
to hold straight, you know?

282
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,280
It's quite hard to find the
right amount of syrup to put.

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,520
This is like the third time
I've refilled this bottle,

284
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,160
so it has taken up quite a lot.

285
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm preparing the ingredients
for the mascarpone mousse.

286
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
250.

287
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,520
Adding gelatine to the mascarpone

288
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,760
will help their slices
keep their shape.

289
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,960
How's your mascarpone whip
coming out, nice?

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,880
Oh, yeah, it's good.

291
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
But too much and the chefs will lose
the creaminess Cherish

292
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
is looking for.

293
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,320
I've got to use a mini scale,
which is a touch more precise.

294
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,560
Not content with deconstructing
the roulade...

295
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,000
No, I don't think I've ever seen
a roulade like this either.

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,200
..Emmanuel and Sam are also
reinventing the tiramisu

297
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,960
by adding an unusual element.

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
Coffee jelly.

299
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,600
It's got to go on the top of
the sponge, then we have the layer

300
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,960
of mascarpone.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,520
Sam, how are we doing on time?
No idea. That's good.

302
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,000
Each layer needs to be set before
you put the next thing.

303
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,240
If it's not set nicely,
you can't get a clean cut,

304
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,520
and we all know Cherish
loves a nice, clean cut.

305
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,320
This is the first layer
of the mascarpone.

306
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,640
Nice and flat, eh? Second layer
of ladyfinger biscuit.

307
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,960
Need to have it as as soon
as possible in the freezer.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,960
Bit of a push now,
I need to get these in.

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,480
I'm going to the blast chiller now.

310
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,320
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
Julie, Julie, we're gonna
have a problem.

312
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,680
That big tray doesn't fit in here.

313
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,560
That's fine, I'll put it
in the freezer.

314
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,080
Having chosen moulds too long
for the blast freezer,

315
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,360
Julie puts them in a normal freezer.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,120
But now her tiramisu
will take longer to set.

317
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,280
Oh, well. Not a lot we could do
about it now, is there?

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
Chefs, you have half an hour left.

319
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,960
Half an hour, Hideko. Yeah.

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,440
Just getting the roulades
ready to roll.

321
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,280
That is back! It's back baby.

322
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
Ganache is back!

323
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,080
Just gonna get my layers separated,
because when you roll it,

324
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,520
it's gonna push it altogether,
anyway.

325
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,920
Pivotal moment.

326
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,560
Crucial moment.

327
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,400
Start rolling.

328
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,800
This is the banana mousse.

329
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,440
It'll stick in the centre.

330
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,520
That way, when you're rolling,
you can keep it nice and tight.

331
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
Ah.

332
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,400
They see me rollin', they hatin'.

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
# They see me rollin'... #

334
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,760
Sorry, chef.

335
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
Oh, la, la.

336
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,320
It stayed too long in the oven,
it's too dry.

337
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,960
It cracked a little bit as I was
rolling it, but the spiral's there.

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
Where do you want this chilling to?
Freezer.

339
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,720
Perfection. It's gonna go quickly
in the blast chiller.

340
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,440
It's sliceable, but you'll get
a better finish if it's cooler.

341
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
Try and take the next layer
of silicon off.

342
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,040
It's gonna freeze even quicker now.

343
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,120
We haven't got that much longer.

344
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,080
The tiramisu has just come out
of the chiller.

345
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,240
We're just gonna dust it with
a bit of cocoa powder.

346
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
They've set on top,
ready for the glaze.

347
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,000
Just heating it up, so I can take
the tiramisu out of the mould.

348
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,000
Got to make sure
you don't over blowtorch it

349
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,600
cos it can actually melt the sides.

350
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,840
Oh, oh! Julie, Julie, Julie!
Oh.

351
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,920
Fire in the hole!

352
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,400
This is the crucial moment.

353
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,080
See all the layer
and if it's straight or not.

354
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,640
Oh, come on.

355
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
Don't do that, please.

356
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,640
Pressure on. Judges are gonna be
tough for sure,

357
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,120
so have to be perfect.

358
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
Done. Happy?

359
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
I think so. Perfect.

360
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,480
It looks all right. That's what I
wanted, the layer I can clearly see.

361
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,720
I'm pretty happy with this,
to be honest.

362
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,960
Layers are good, eh?

363
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,920
Is that still soft? Yeah.

364
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,480
I want to get it out of the mould
so I can get it back in

365
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,280
the blast freezer.
OK, so you do that.

366
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,240
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

367
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
We've got ten minutes.

368
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
Gonna start to portion up.

369
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,000
Try to keep it
as clean as you can.

370
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,600
By turning it on its side
and having it doubled up,

371
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,920
you've now got six layers
in half the time.

372
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,040
It's quite a thick sponge.

373
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,120
It's risen maybe
a little bit too much.

374
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,880
It's looking a bit square.

375
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,520
Oh, I see what you mean.
It's alternative.

376
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,640
We just hope that it'll taste good.

377
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,880
Just making the decor
for the roulade now.

378
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,680
I need to cool it
down a little bit.

379
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,440
If it's too hot, it's not gonna
do the drop like that.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,160
Are you all right, Darryl?
Got a troublesome slice.

381
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Just wondering if they're gonna
stay where they are in the warmth.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,240
It's very soft.

383
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,320
Is that still soft?

384
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,840
Keep on cutting it
and I'll finish this off, OK?

385
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
How long do we have?

386
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
Chefs, you have five minutes,
five minutes left.

387
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,240
Crikey, this one's to the knuckle.

388
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,680
Go to the end, last minute.
Yeah.

389
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,160
It's really setting quick, though.

390
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,520
Mind your back. Hot, hot.

391
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,880
I'm doing some rochelles
with some mascarpone.

392
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,520
My finishing could be a bit better,
but it is where it is right now.

393
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
Ah, ah.

394
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,120
You OK there?

395
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,520
Are we crackalackin'?
Rock on, Tommy.

396
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,960
Need to work faster.

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
4, 8, 12, 16, 20.

398
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,800
We need to get another four on.

399
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,600
We'll get it done in time,
something will come out.

400
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,200
Chefs, you have one minute left!

401
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,040
BLEEP. One minute.

402
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
I might need a bit of a push,
Darryl.

403
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,040
Soon as I get my chocolate on,
I'll be with you.

404
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,400
Are you doing the chocolate?
I'm doing the chocolate.

405
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
Just get the biscuit first.

406
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
Let's do this.

407
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
Time's up, chefs!

408
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,280
Step away from your ladyfingers.

409
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,560
Oh! Thank God that's over.
Let's just hope they stay up.

410
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,960
Maybe lay it down, yeah.

411
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
That was horrendous.

412
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,200
The teams must now present their
48 layered slices

413
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480
to judges Benoit and Cherish.

414
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,080
Darryl and Bharat
from Resorts World,

415
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,680
could you please come forward?

416
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
So, your roulade.

417
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,080
I like the fact that you have tried

418
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,320
to do a pattern with your
two fillings.

419
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,920
As a whole, I think it looks
a little bit heavy-handed.

420
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,680
The biggest mistake is the
thickness of your sponge.

421
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,760
But I like the texture
of your filling.

422
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
I've got contrast,
and it's actually pleasant.

423
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,360
Well, let's look at
your tiramisu slice.

424
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,640
I really like the small touch
of the heart.

425
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
Is there any meaning to it?

426
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
Just pure love.

427
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
Aw, one from you and one from you.

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,120
Well...I think it does taste
like a tiramisu.

429
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,400
Phew!

430
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,280
And I really like your coffee syrup
that you put in,

431
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,920
I think it's beautiful.

432
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,000
The first layer of your sponge, over
here, is just perfectly soaked.

433
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,200
Compared to the last heat,
you're trying really to say,

434
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
"Hang on a minute,
we have what it takes."

435
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,400
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Thank you.

436
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,640
Mmm. Some positives. Yeah.

437
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
It's all right.

438
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,000
Can Bom Bom Patisserie
please come forward?

439
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
Come on then, boss.

440
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,560
On the visual, we've got
more of a squarish roulade.

441
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,400
Can somebody bring me
a cup of builder tea?

442
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,600
I need to dunk this in.

443
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
It was just so dry.

444
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
I think what you've
managed to create,

445
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,440
because of the addition of the
tonka bean, is actually pleasant.

446
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
But it is dry.

447
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,280
So, moving on swiftly,

448
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,040
you are exposing the top
of your mascarpone

449
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,240
and it doesn't look very appealing.

450
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,040
I was trying to search for the
beautiful profile of a tiramisu,

451
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,920
and I could not find it in here.

452
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,440
Everything is dry and claggy.

453
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
Thank you. Thank you.

454
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,800
Is there any reason why you lie down
your roulade?

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,360
We tried to make it stand and then
it fell down a bit.

456
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,080
Visually,
it's not the most attractive.

457
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,000
I think it's nice. Thank you.

458
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
The sponge is...

459
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,480
I find the hazelnut everywhere,
and I love that.

460
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
But I think you put in rosemary.

461
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,760
Yeah, it's very subtle.

462
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,760
Pfft. Gone.

463
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,040
Now, the tiramisu.

464
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,040
I like the idea of the
sponge being piped.

465
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
Beside that...

466
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,480
..it's really a slab.

467
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,840
I like the texture of your
mascarpone cream.

468
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
The bottom part, though,
I did not enjoy, too dry.

469
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,280
I was just craving for the tiramisu
flavour, I just could not taste it.

470
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
Thank you very much. See you later.
Thank you.

471
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,640
Well done. Thanks.

472
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,160
Hilton Park Lane,
please come forward.

473
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
Oh, la-la-la-la-la.

474
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,440
OK. So, the roulade.

475
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,080
I would have hoped to see a sheet of
baked sponge rolled on itself.

476
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,880
Is this a roulade? I'm not too sure.

477
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,040
Did you take it too far?

478
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,360
Let's try. Let's have a go.

479
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,440
You've done a lot of work.

480
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,280
Would you have done all those rolled
on each other...

481
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,640
..you had a fantastic flavour
combination there.

482
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,560
Love it, love it, love it.

483
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,760
However, I asked for scrambled egg,
you give me omelette.

484
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,080
Now, the tiramisu.

485
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,720
Presentation-wise, I'm happy.

486
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,480
I was trying to capture the
sensation of eating a tiramisu,

487
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,200
the creamy, silky mascarpone cream.

488
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,680
Hmm.

489
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
I didn't have that.

490
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
It's too much gelatine in the slice.

491
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
Thank you. See you later.

492
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
BLEEP.

493
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,200
Michael and Rebekah from St David's
Hotel, please come forward.

494
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
This is what I'm talking about.

495
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,120
A nice swirl movement.

496
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,200
It looks appealing.

497
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,840
I just felt that the banana actually

498
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
overtakes the flavour
of the roulade.

499
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
The tiramisu.

500
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,280
As a whole, the slice,
a little bit basic.

501
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
Shall we taste?

502
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,480
This part here is completely dry.

503
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
I was just hoping that you use syrup
a little bit more.

504
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,000
Not "a little bit more", more.

505
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,840
Because it's not been soaked at all.

506
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,760
I did not really enjoy eating
your tiramisu, sorry, guys.

507
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,000
Thank you very much. Thank you.
We'll see you later.

508
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
They look how I feel.

509
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,800
I think it's because you put
your heart into it.

510
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,880
REBEKAH LAUGHS
I can't help laughing.

511
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,640
BLEEP crying over a cake, like.

512
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
It's only cake, love.

513
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
It's only cake.

514
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,840
That was brutal.

515
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
Looking back on it,
it would have been a lot easier

516
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,520
to do the roulade as a roulade.
That would have helped. Yep.

517
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,080
Oh, God.

518
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,400
I knew a lot of shooting
was going to come.

519
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,880
Yeah. And it did from Cherish.

520
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,720
THEO: A bit mixed for everyone.
So I think everything is still open

521
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,520
and I think tomorrow is going
to be a crucial day.

522
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,640
On a scale of one to ten,
I'm a seven.

523
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,120
I'm not going to go any higher than
that, because it might all

524
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,640
drop out tomorrow
and I'll be down to a one.

525
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
The teams have been given
a golden hour this evening

526
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,040
to get ahead for tomorrow's
monumental challenge.

527
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,160
So, out of all the teams,
who's done the best?

528
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,360
Resort World have done
themselves proud.

529
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,960
There was tears last time,

530
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,040
but they have delivered two strong
miniature challenge today.

531
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,560
And what teams are
you worried about this week?

532
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,280
My little colleagues from
the St David's Hotel.

533
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
It's a game of two halves with them,

534
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,320
because they are the only roulade
which presents that lovely swirl.

535
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,080
However, there's no sensation
of the tiramisu in the slice.

536
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,880
For me, I'm really worried
about the Bom Bom,

537
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,280
because it didn't quite
come together today for them.

538
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
What a disappointment.

539
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,240
So, what do you want to see
in tomorrow's showpiece?

540
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,600
It needs to be huge,
it needs to be amazing.

541
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,360
Let's just hope the teams
absolutely wreck it tomorrow,

542
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,200
I want to see madness
in the kitchen.

543
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,280
What is "wreck it"? Like, wreck it
means, like, smash it, do it well.

544
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,120
Morning. Morning.
Morning. Morning.

545
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,000
Good morning, chefs.

546
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,000
Today, the judges would like you
to make an occasion showpiece,

547
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,080
big enough to feed
at least 36 people,

548
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,960
in the form of a croquembouche.
Gesundheit.

549
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,160
Traditionally, a croquembouche is
constructed in the shape of a cone.

550
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,320
But we do not want to see tradition
in this kitchen today.

551
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,280
Make it modern
and build it around a theme.

552
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,600
I want to be impressed and excited
by your flavour.

553
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,120
Chefs, you had one hour
last night to prepare,

554
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,640
and you have four hours remaining

555
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,600
to complete today's
Showpiece Challenge.

556
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,280
On your marks, get set...

557
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,200
..bake. No!

558
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,680
That's the other show.

559
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,920
Oh, yeah. The UN-professionals.

560
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,360
Chefs, on your marks, get set...

561
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,400
..patisserie.

562
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:05,000
Good luck. Good luck.

563
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
Let's do this.

564
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,200
A croquembouche is an
elaborately decorated,

565
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,520
cone-shaped tower made with
creme-patissiere-filled choux buns,

566
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,800
glued together with caramel.

567
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,400
In France, they are traditionally
served as wedding cakes.

568
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,000
My wife still holds
a little grudge on me

569
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,280
not having done a croquembouche
for our own wedding.

570
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,560
Many things can go wrong, of course,
with the croquembouche.

571
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,840
I'm going to blush, here.

572
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,040
If you've got the wrong ratio
of ingredients

573
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,960
within your pastry cream,
you may end up having something

574
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,880
lumpy or gummy,
everything but very creamy.

575
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,560
Mind your head.

576
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
The choux needs to
be baked to perfection,

577
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,280
or the structure will collapse.

578
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,920
I would like the chef to be very
creative with this challenge.

579
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,120
Technical skill is crucial.

580
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,080
It's all about the wow factor.

581
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,200
I want to be saying, "Why didn't
I think of that before?"

582
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,560
What did you set the timer?
Four hours, yeah? Yep.

583
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,880
The teams' contemporary take on a
croquembouche

584
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,440
must have an innovative shape.

585
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,640
So as well as their talent with
choux and sugar work...

586
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,160
Bang. That's what we needed.

587
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,360
..it will also be a daunting test

588
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,480
of their skills in design
and engineering.

589
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,280
HIDEKO:

590
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,280
I couldn't sleep last night.

591
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,800
I normally sleep anywhere,
any condition.

592
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,680
Tallest cake I ever made
was a croquembouche,

593
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,280
but that's years and years ago.

594
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,440
After yesterday, I think we need to
redeem ourselves on this one.

595
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,920
Emmanuel and Sam's showpiece will
sit on a beautiful nougatine plinth,

596
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,400
and be flavoured with
raspberry and pistachio

597
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,560
and orange liqueur and mandarin.

598
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,680
For its shape, they have
ambitiously chosen a sphere.

599
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,560
The structure you have chosen
is not an easy one.

600
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,560
You are comfortable?
We're not comfortable.

601
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,440
Good. We definitely put
ourselves, again, in a situation,

602
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,800
where we want
to challenge ourselves.

603
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,560
How many times have you practised?
Three times, I would say.

604
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,960
To be honest, two times,
the nougatine collapsed.

605
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,160
It collapsed? Oh, no.

606
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,400
For their design, Hideko and Theo

607
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,000
aren't so much thinking outside
boxes as making them.

608
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,920
It's going to look
like a cube tower.

609
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,840
Three layers.

610
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:21,960
Hideko and Theo are making three
fillings for their croquembouche.

611
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,520
Matcha, sesame

612
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,040
and cassis and chestnut.

613
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,960
A different flavour for each
of their minimalist choux boxes.

614
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,400
But what is the theme?

615
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,160
It's a new, modern style.

616
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,120
But is new, modern style a theme?

617
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,280
Are you ready? Yeah, pass it on
to me, please. There you go.

618
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:45,400
Thank you. We didn't feel as though
we did too great yesterday,

619
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,600
with the judges' comments, so, yeah,
we need to pull it out the bag.

620
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,400
Marta and Julie are aiming to
redeem themselves

621
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,960
with an exotic showpiece.

622
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Coming from Brazil, we decided
to go for a tropical theme.

623
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,120
What is it going to look like,
a giant pineapple or

624
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,840
something like that? The structure
is going to be a pineapple.

625
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,440
A giant pineapple?!

626
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,800
I was guessing!

627
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:07,640
Their coconut, lime and caramelised
pineapple choux buns

628
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,560
will sit on a towering,
eight-tier stand,

629
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,680
constructed from nougatine.

630
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,920
So, there will be a lot of nougatine
to be worked with, yeah?

631
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,080
Have you worked with nougatine
a lot before? Yeah.

632
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,280
OK, so you're confident.
Yes, I'm quite confident.

633
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,720
Good luck, chef. Thank you.
I think we should samba out.

634
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,760
Samba out.

635
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,400
Darryl and Bharat have chosen a
theme a bit closer to home.

636
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,680
The theme for today
is luck of the Irish.

637
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,120
Are you Irish? No,

638
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,840
my roots are actually Trinidadian.

639
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,480
We need a bit of luck,
so we thought we'd use their luck.

640
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,280
Hoping their design
will work like a charm,

641
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,800
the boys will build a base of buns

642
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,320
filled with white chocolate and

643
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,000
raspberry, a leprechaun's hat

644
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,480
covered with Irish cream

645
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,640
and milk chocolate choux,

646
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,080
and a giant sugar shamrock.

647
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,000
BHARAT: We made the shamrock during
the golden hour last night.

648
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,640
We peel everything off and you get a
beautiful mirror finish.

649
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,080
Oh, there's a crack, there.

650
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,280
I'm going to fix that.

651
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,360
For their design,
Michael and Rebecca's inspiration...

652
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,680
Ugh, splat.
..was right on their doorstep.

653
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,000
We do a lot of afternoon teas and
stuff at the hotel,

654
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,960
so our theme is afternoon tea.

655
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,680
Featuring two giant
nougatine wheels,

656
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,160
adorned with a handcrafted sugar
tea set,

657
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,640
and filled with their Earl Grey and
clotted cream flavoured buns,

658
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,400
their imposing creation will sit
on a stand

659
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,600
made from seven layers of choux.

660
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,720
Roughly, it'll probably
be about that high.

661
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,520
No pressure at all, none whatsoever.

662
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,080
Chefs, you have three hours left,
three hours.

663
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
HIDEKO: I am cooking nougatine.

664
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,960
It's based on sugar and glucose,
as well as almond.

665
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,880
Nougatine is a
key structural element,

666
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,960
but moulding it can be tricky.

667
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,680
EMMANUEL: You need to know
when to use it.

668
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,760
There's no point to try to use it
when it's too hot.

669
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,480
Because it sticks to everything.

670
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,640
It cools down and caramel sets and
you can't do anything out of it.

671
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,560
With the nougatine hardening
rapidly as it cools...

672
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,920
BLEEP.

673
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
..speed is of the essence.

674
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,960
Julie, get a move on.

675
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,360
And the more nougatine they have,
the quicker they have to be.

676
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,840
Our stand is going to be
about ten levels high,

677
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,240
so we need a lot of nougatine.

678
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,600
My problem is, I'm a bit slow so
they set before I can shape them.

679
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
Oh, bloody hell.

680
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,720
Right, then. Back in the oven.

681
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,000
Oh, Julie.

682
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Re-melting the nougatine
will take time.

683
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,680
I'm going to have to get a move on.
Time they don't have.

684
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,840
Get me bottom into gear.

685
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,320
An hour and a half left, chefs.
90 minutes left.

686
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,600
Got an hour until assembly. OK?
Yeah.

687
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,200
While Julie wrestles
with her nougatine...

688
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
Two done, ten to go.

689
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,640
..the other teams...
Look at the size of your whisk.

690
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,760
..turn to fillings for their choux.

691
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,480
We are going to add the pistachio
paste to the pastry cream.

692
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,440
One's going to be cassis and
chestnut, one is going to be matcha,

693
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,560
and one is going to be
white and dark seasoning.

694
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,440
The way you cut choux,
I want to see a little surprise
in the colour.

695
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,840
This is the Irish cream. Last week,
Cherish found it a bit too boozy,

696
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,440
so hopefully, it's not
as bad this week.

697
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,960
Are they meant to be that big?
I don't know what the right size is!

698
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,600
If you cut through, hopefully,
you'll see the mandarin gel
that I'm piping in the middle.

699
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,720
You just want a little dollop
in there, don't you? A blob,
so they can taste it.

700
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,440
Come on, mate, come on, chop, chop!
I've got to get these ones right.

701
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,040
That's my pineapple gel,
so I'll insert it in,

702
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,280
and then I put the coconut
and lime custard on.

703
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,120
Come on. One hour left, chefs.
You have one hour.

704
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,200
Right, then. Rock on, Tommy.
Starting to build
the croquembouche shell,

705
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,800
just stick it together with caramel.

706
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,240
Kind of a crucial stage,
cos everything else will be sat
on top of this.

707
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,040
The more complex the design...
Julie's concentrating.

708
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,320
She can't talk right now.

709
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,280
..the riskier it will be
to assemble.

710
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,720
You've got way too much.
Go easy.

711
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,840
Which one's first?

712
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,720
This one is the straightest one.

713
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,360
Right, OK. Ready?

714
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,440
Marta and Julie,
I quite like the structure

715
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,640
they're going to put up for us.

716
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,600
It's a pineapple.
It's quite intriguing.

717
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,800
Will they manage to pull it off?
We don't know.

718
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,000
Don't move, don't move.
Once it's on, it's on.

719
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,720
Stick those like this. Sweep up.

720
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,680
I'm not convinced. It's three cubes
stacked on each other.

721
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,920
It's a simple design.
So, what about the Hilton Park Lane?

722
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,160
Their croquembouche is kind of
a risky business.

723
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,800
They've made it three times
and it collapsed twice! Wow! Woohoo!

724
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,080
I'm running out of time.

725
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,560
I should already be on
the second half-sphere.

726
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,200
Relax.
I go for a beer, yeah?

727
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,640
Chefs, you have 30 minutes left.

728
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,120
Starting on sugar. Yeah.

729
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,400
I'm attempting to pull
a sugar ribbon.

730
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,400
I see people on YouTube doing it.

731
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,280
I did the UK Sugar Championships
and came second,

732
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
so, done a bit of sugar.

733
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,240
I am building my pineapple.
This needs to be straight.

734
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
Eyeing up the opposition.

735
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,040
They're doing some roses.
They're quite tricky.

736
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,280
This looks beautiful. Right now,
we're getting close on time.

737
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
So I'm going to have to be
more de-board it.

738
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
I don't want to do this
in front of everybody else.

739
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,360
Why? It's a very private thing?
It's very fragile and difficult.

740
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,120
Like myself.
SUGAR SHATTERS

741
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,360
BLEEP!

742
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,240
I was trying to get it really
straight. I've pressed it too hard.

743
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,080
It just sort of went...

744
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,240
That's fine.
I can start building it again.
Yeah, go for it. Go, go.

745
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,600
Hopefully, it's going to be stable.

746
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,400
If you hear a crack,
I won't be happy.

747
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,720
It looks like it's coming this way.
I need the spirit level in here,
please.

748
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,360
That's fine. It's fine.
Stop saying, "It's fine"! It's fine.

749
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,560
You have to be quick.
Only a little bit. That's it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

750
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,920
Mike, just watch at the back,
the dripping. I just noticed that.

751
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,640
Round two.
Shall we move this to the table?

752
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,640
One, two, three...

753
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,120
Lift, lift...lift.
No shock, no shock, no shock.

754
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,960
Careful you don't make too much
of a mess with it.

755
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,320
That's it, that's it.
God help us.

756
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,000
Heart is like...
HE THUMPS HIS CHEST

757
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
Magic.

758
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,640
That way? No, this way.
Facing that way. Oh, my God.

759
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,960
BLEEP! That weighs a tonne.

760
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,040
I can't see an actual thing.
I'll get it. Am I going down?

761
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,120
Yeah, go down.
Go down, go down, go down!

762
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,960
Ooh! Five minutes, chefs.
Five minutes to go.

763
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,880
Oh, I feel really pressured now.

764
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,200
Doing the shell.
I need to build it first.

765
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,480
Let's go. The sugar is setting
so quickly, we need to keep going.

766
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
One small one, if you got it.
There's a wobble under there.

767
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,560
Oh, BLEEP!

768
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,600
This has to go on.
These are our lucky coins.

769
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,680
I'm pretty much almost done.

770
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,800
Anyone know
what time we've got left?

771
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,360
Chefs, you have one minute left.

772
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,920
This way? Yeah. Yeah.

773
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,760
This needs to go on.
Still got to pipe some leaves on it.

774
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,160
Oh, no, no, no, no!

775
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,920
I've just got to
stick the ribbons on.

776
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,280
Move it, move it! Get the greens.
Get the greens going.

777
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,240
I think it needs to turn
around a little bit.

778
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,920
Go, go, go, go, go!

779
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,680
Time's up.

780
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,680
Step away from your showpieces.

781
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,840
Let's tidy up, girl.

782
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,040
Right, let's go

783
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
and get destroyed! Yeah!

784
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,880
Five awe-inspiring showpieces

785
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
made in just five hours.

786
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,800
I just can't get over Park Lane's.

787
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,880
I don't even know
how they did that shape.

788
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,000
Guys, you've produced
something extremely visual.

789
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,800
Really like the lines.

790
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,640
What a joy to watch
both of your work.

791
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,000
And so pleased to see the way
you pull your flower.

792
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,000
Shall we taste the choux?

793
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,240
You should have an orange liqueur
with a mandarin jam.

794
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,040
The choux is quite pleasant to eat.

795
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,640
I really enjoy the mandarin flavour.

796
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,080
Having said that, we've lost
the orange liqueur altogether

797
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,960
because of the fragrance
of your mandarin.

798
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,240
And this one will be pistachio
and raspberry.

799
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,520
Overall, the texture of the filling
is good.

800
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,760
However, I hardly can taste
the pistachio.

801
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,760
And I've lost the
raspberry altogether.

802
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,880
I'm not enjoying this.

803
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,000
That was good.

804
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,200
Really, guys,

805
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,440
I would not have thought of doing
something like that

806
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
in a million miles.

807
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
I really like it.

808
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,120
That is vanilla, white chocolate
and raspberry puree.

809
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,720
It's fragrant, raspberry is present.

810
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,360
I really like your custard
because it's really smooth.

811
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,520
It goes so well
with the raspberry jam.

812
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,120
So we do the Irish liqueur...

813
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,360
I've got the Irish liqueur.

814
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Personally, I find it
a bit too strong.

815
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,320
I love it.

816
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,840
A matter of taste. I thought
it was going to be too sweet.

817
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,840
I was wrong. I love the taste.

818
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
Thank you. Thank you.

819
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
I think it's a beautiful showpiece
that you've done.

820
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,840
It's an elegant croque-en-bouche.

821
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,760
But you've gone, not just
simplistic, you've got simple.

822
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,160
We've got now three choux.

823
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,040
This one is...
BOTH: Matcha.

824
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
I think the taste is perfect.

825
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,760
However, the creme patissiere,
I didn't enjoy eating it.

826
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,960
It is a bit gummy.

827
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,840
Blackcurrant.
Blackcurrant and chestnut.

828
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
Trying to taste the chestnut.

829
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,520
However, if I eat it without knowing
there is chestnut in there,

830
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,920
I wouldn't notice it. Black sesame.

831
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,160
I love my black sesame.

832
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
For me, this, I like.

833
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,840
A little bit creamier,
and that choux would be perfection.

834
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,240
It's all right. It's all right.
He kind of liked it.

835
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,640
Let's talk about the elephant
in the room.

836
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,120
It's tilting slightly.

837
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,760
Yeah. Yeah.

838
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
We also have to mention the neatness
of your work needs to improve.

839
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,160
It was ten minutes before,
you were still sticking.

840
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,240
Yeah. You were rushing.
Certainly was rushing.

841
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,800
The filling of the choux has got
a coconut and lime custard

842
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,040
and then a pineapple gel inside.

843
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,440
The choux pastry is baked nicely.

844
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,920
The crackling has got
a nice texture.

845
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,920
Sorry, Cherish.
Is it not pineapple on yours?

846
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,440
Empty again! Not acceptable.

847
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,680
Sorry, I would not pay
for your dessert.

848
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,000
There is a little bit at the bottom
of this one.

849
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,000
Well, to be honest with you,
it didn't taste much anyway.

850
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
You get some?

851
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,160
No.

852
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,120
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

853
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,520
There it is, majestuous, tall.

854
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,520
It's a little bit chunky,

855
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,120
and also, as a style,
it is a little bit dated.

856
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,520
OK. And, looking at your teapot,

857
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,720
I was hoping that you were more
delicate with your finishing touch.

858
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,800
We've gone with
an afternoon tea theme,

859
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,200
so we have a clotted cream choux bun
and there's a strawberry gel.

860
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,120
I would like to talk
about this choux pastry.

861
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
I think it's very heavy-handed,

862
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,880
and also, I didn't taste
the clotted cream.

863
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,600
And then an Earl Grey
and lemon choux bun.

864
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,880
The texture of the Earl Grey cream
is better than the clotted cream.

865
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,760
After, the flavour combination
was pretty uninteresting.

866
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,280
It wasn't great.

867
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,600
On the first taste, I said,
"Oh, I can taste the Earl Grey,"

868
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,080
and then the acid comes in

869
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,280
and I didn't really enjoy,
so, sorry,

870
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,920
I didn't like this at all. OK.

871
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,920
SHE SOBS

872
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,840
Come, come.

873
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,240
CHERISH: Come on, don't cry.

874
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,760
That was so embarrassing.

875
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,600
Like, proper embarrassing.

876
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,240
What you crying for?
I don't know.

877
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,400
Based on their performance across
both challenges,

878
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,680
the judges will now rank the teams,

879
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,880
and the team in last place

880
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,520
will have to leave the competition.

881
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,920
After yesterday's disappointment,

882
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,960
we produced exactly what we wanted
to, to the level we wanted to.

883
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,360
Whatever happens now, I feel
we've done ourselves proud.

884
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,880
Very interesting, don't you think?

885
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,360
I like the colour scheme there.

886
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
We started off the competition
on a quite low peg,

887
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,840
but this week we smashed it,
I think.

888
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,920
A bit chunky.

889
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,160
It's all constructive criticism,
at the end of the day.

890
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,440
Yeah, go back and learn.

891
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,080
They don't say it to offend you,
they say it to make you improve.

892
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,440
It's still hard to hear. Yeah.

893
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,040
Benoit and Cherish have reached
their decision.

894
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,480
The team in first place excelled
in their flavours and presentation

895
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,320
across two tough challenges.

896
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,440
Congratulations...

897
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,560
Darryl and Bharat from
Resorts World.

898
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,280
You are through to the next round.

899
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,520
In second place are Emmanuel and Sam
from the Hilton Park Lane...

900
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,000
And Sweet Art Lab's Hideko and Theo
have come third.

901
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,160
Which leaves Michael and Rebekah
from the St David's Hotel

902
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,560
and Marta and Julie
from Bom Bom Patisserie.

903
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,280
After much deliberation, the team
going home tonight will be...

904
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,280
..Marta and Julie
from Bom Bom Patisserie.

905
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,160
Congratulations to the rest of you.

906
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,400
We'll see you next week.

907
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,040
Oh, I'm feeling a bit upset.

908
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,800
Yeah, disappointed.

909
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,640
It's your first competition, right?
Yes.

910
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,080
I'm proud of what we've done.
Aren't you?

911
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,680
It's given me my passion
back for my trade.

912
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
Oh, you lot smashed it.

913
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,480
Brilliant. Yeah, fantastic.

914
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,560
Yeah, really, really happy about it.

915
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,240
It makes you want to stay there.

916
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
You know? It makes you
fight even more.

917
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,560
BLEEP.

918
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
Um, yeah, shocked.

919
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,920
I can't believe it!
I thought we were gone!

920
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,520
I think we've got to go hard
or go home next week.

921
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,720
Next time, the competition
only gets tougher...

922
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,880
BLEEP.

923
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,600
..as the judges set the first
ever Secret Recipe Challenge...

924
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,120
I have no idea how it looks like.

925
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,480
..and a decadent showpiece...

926
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:21,880
BLEEP. Drama!

927
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,720
..made entirely of chocolate.
Not doing this again.

928
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:27,000
Which three teams will make it
through to the final six?

929
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,040
I'm scared!

930
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,240
And who will crack...
It's going to be a fun puzzle.

931
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,520
..under the pressure?

932
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:33,280
Well, it's not great news.

933
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,520
Just when I thought they were
in a good mood.

934
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,440

﻿1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,840
Welcome back to Bake Off:
The Professionals,

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:06,440
where the search for Britain's best
pastry chef is hotting up.

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,760
Tom will now explain why.
Thank you, Liam. Yes, I will.

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,840
Now, we started off
with this set of six

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,080
who by the end of tomorrow

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,280
will be whittled down to the three
best teams in this set of heats.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,120
Then, next week,
we'll meet a new set of six

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:19,360
who will then be similarly
whittled down to three.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,760
This new set of six will then be
whittled down to the final

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,280
where one of them will be crowned
Emperor of Pastries.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,120
Or something like that.
It's just like the World Cup.

12
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,480
No, it's not.
It's just like the Olympics.

13
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,760
No. Formula 1, is that a sport?

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Tom, what are you talking about?
Oh, give me a break, Liam.

15
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,920
I'm just trying to make it
so the viewers can understand it.

16
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,560
You know, like when we say
"entremet" instead of cake.

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,760
Ignore him. It's Chocolate Week, and
that's all you guys need to know.

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,240
Last time... Ooh!

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,720
the teams battled with
croquembouche.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,320
It weighs a ton.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,440
Darryl and Bharat's
masterful showpiece

22
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,920
secured a winning comeback.

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,360
I really like it.
Thank you very much.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,880
There was a wake-up call
for Michael and Rebekah.

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,640
Don't cry.

26
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
But Marta and Julie
came up short on flavour...

27
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,440
Not acceptable.

28
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,400
..and became the second team
to leave the competition.

29
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,760
I'm proud of what we've done,
aren't you?

30
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,920
This time... Come on, baby.

31
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,840
..the first set of heats
come to an end.

32
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,200
Ooh, sha-la-la.

33
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,640
With a place in
the final six at stake...

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,000
The pressure is getting to me.

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,800
..the teams face a recipe they've
never seen before. I'm scared.

36
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,960
And a towering showpiece
made entirely of chocolate.

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,880
Oh, BLEEP. Do you think
it's going to hold?

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Which three teams will move forward?

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,800
And who... Big problem.
..will be left behind?

40
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,400
Chocolate Week will decide
which three teams

41
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,720
will make it through to
the final stages of the competition.

42
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,760
And whose journey
will come to an end.

43
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,760
To ensure only the most gifted chefs
progress,

44
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,400
the judges have upped the ante
with a secret challenge.

45
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,000
What is it?

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,520
This is the first time
the teams have no idea

47
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,680
what they're about to make.

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,160
Good morning, chefs.

49
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,560
I sense an increased level
of anxiety today.

50
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:28,120
And rightly so,
because you're about to face

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:33,320
this competition's first-ever
Secret Recipe Challenge.

52
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,680
No preparation, no practice,
just your wits and knowledge.

53
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,440
Trust me when I say
this challenge is hard.

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,400
The secret recipe
we have chosen is called

55
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,760
Feuille D'automne.

56
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,720
Chef, we want to see layers of
perfectly baked meringue

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,640
sandwiched with chocolate mousse,
topped with chocolate rosace,

58
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,120
and served on a chocolate stand.

59
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,440
Which must be made
as part of your challenge.

60
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,080
You have 3.5 hours,
and your time starts now.

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,280
I can't pronounce it.
Fuel de auton?

62
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,200
It is a French cake.
Yeah. I've never seen it.

63
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,640
It's difficult when you see
a load of things and are trying

64
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
to work out what you should do,
what you shouldn't do.

65
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:24,120
I want to go home.

66
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
Secret recipe for the first time.

67
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,920
I'm so excited, because the chefs
are not able to prepare.

68
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,880
It will come down to deux part.

69
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,280
The Feuille D'automne gateau
for one,

70
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,000
and the chocolate stand
for the others.

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,880
We want to know their instinct.
What can they come up with?

72
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,200
What should we do first? I think
we need to get the stuff ready

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,400
for the chocolate stand
and figure out what we're doing.

74
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,400
The teams have been given
a selection of moulds, paints,

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,000
and tools to fashion
their chocolate stands.

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,920
I can do a little impression on it.

77
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:57,680
Have a texture.

78
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,160
Make a base, maybe...

79
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,000
..something like this.

80
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,800
Michael and Rebekah.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Always a ray of sunshine.

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,640
How are you feeling today?
Not too bad, not too bad.

83
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,560
Good. Good. What about the stand?
Have you done a sketch of it?

84
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,880
We have kind of got a basic design.
It looks like a lovely egg timer.

85
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,720
It does. Just turn it upside down.
Turn it upside down.

86
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,280
If it all goes wrong,
we'll turn it upside down.

87
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
Whichever way they choose to
present it,

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,160
Michael and Rebekah's stand
will consist of a column of

89
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,400
three chocolate spheres
and will be decorated with leaves.

90
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,080
Is there enough to wow both of us?

91
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,640
I hope so.

92
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,640
Try not to be old-fashioned.
Do not be old-fashioned.

93
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
It needs to look like me today.

94
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,640
So sleek. Fashion forward.

95
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,400
Slick and trendy, Cherish,
slick and trendy.

96
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,480
The teams set to work
casting their chocolate stands.

97
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,600
With just three and half hours,

98
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,680
they must work fast
to allow time for them to set.

99
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,560
About this high. Yeah...

100
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,040
It looks too high.
I don't think it will set quickly.

101
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,120
Last week's winners,
Darryl and Bharat,

102
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,120
are taking a cautious approach...

103
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,880
..with a simple pillar and a base
decorated with spheres.

104
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,080
We know we can do more.
I think we thought,

105
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,320
the time frame we are in,
go a bit safe.

106
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,880
One team, however,
is throwing caution to the wind.

107
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,000
How's it going? Hello.
Good morning, everyone.

108
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,600
How are we doing?

109
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,240
ALL SPEAK AT ONCE

110
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,720
I saw a beautiful drawing.
Please take us through.

111
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,520
Our plan is feminine,
like a line, like this.

112
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,760
Give it height.

113
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:42,080
Hideko and Theo are going big.

114
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,240
Their signature avant-garde design

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,200
will see their stand adorned
with abstract shapes

116
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,160
and a handcrafted lotus flower.

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:52,600
He's making leaves
and also melting white chocolate

118
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:56,200
a little bit for petals.
So it's more abstract.

119
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,960
Again? Abstract?

120
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,120
Organic. Freestyle strategy.

121
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,400
Yeah. Freestyle. Freestyle.
Let it flow.

122
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,200
Let it flow, yeah?

123
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,520
Is your stand
going to hold your cake?

124
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,280
Let's see. Let's see.

125
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,040
Emmanuel and Sam are also hoping
an ambitious design

126
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,400
will help them secure a place in the
final stages of the competition.

127
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,680
The only way you're going to get far

128
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,040
is by going all-out
as much as you can.

129
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,440
And anything we do,
we're trying to go all-out.

130
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:30,360
We don't want to go home.
And we don't want to go home.

131
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
Their stand will be made of
spiral sphere pillars

132
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:39,040
enhanced by a marble-effect base
and elaborate decorations.

133
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,000
You making the flowers? Yeah.

134
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,680
Enjoy.

135
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
Mmm.

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,040
Cherish will probably say...

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,480
"Chef, it's well-tempered."

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
Oh, I can hear the crack. Yup.

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,720
You guys got this, man.
We'll find out, won't we?

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,040
Two hours left, chefs,
you've got two hours left.

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,320
The stand is setting
and waiting to be unmould.

142
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,040
And then making the cake.

143
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
The teams must now
turn their attention

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,680
to their Feuille D'automne -

145
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,600
an obscure French delicacy
none of them have made before.

146
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,840
A Feuille D'automne
consists of layer of meringue

147
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,200
and chocolate mousse,

148
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,200
finished with a band of chocolate

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
and topped with chocolate rosace.

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,040
But if you've never seen it before,
never done it before,

151
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
it's going to be really, really
strange.

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,960
And I think this is the challenge.
This is what they are afraid of.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,840
The part where no control.

154
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
We got the recipe, but knowing
how to do it is a different thing.

155
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
I have no idea how it looks like.
No idea.

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,360
Maybe like a layer of the mousse,
sandwiched with meringue. Meringue.

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,040
Morning, guys. Morning, Liam.
How are you?

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,560
Yeah, not too bad, how's it going?

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,480
So at the moment, I'm starting the
meringue. Whip it in the machine.

160
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
Whip it. Have you, do you know
that dance, Whip It?

161
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,720
Should we nae-nae?
LIAM LAUGHS

162
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,320
Do that again. I'm not doing it.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,240
Just one more time. No. I'll whip
it, you nae-nae, and I'll go. OK?

164
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
OK, let's do it.

165
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,600
Watch me nae-nae.

166
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,680
Go, get going. I'm gone, I'm gone.

167
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,200
OK, bye. Good luck, guys. Bye!

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,520
Are you doing the meringue?
Yeah.

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh, sorry. I'll clean it up.
Sorry, Chef.

170
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
No, no, no. Oh, sorry, sorry.

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,760
Sabotage. Sabotage,
sabotage, sabotage.

172
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,240
The meringue is the bedrock
of this gateau.

173
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,040
It's crucial
the teams bake them correctly.

174
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
Obviously if the meringue
is not baked right,

175
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,200
it doesn't hold the mousse.

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,640
If you underbake the meringue,
it's going to be too soft.

177
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,480
If you overcook it, it could also
collapse quite easily.

178
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
While most are opting for
a quick bake...

179
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,200
15? Yeah.

180
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,360
15 minutes. Ten.

181
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,480
..Emmanuel and Sam
are taking the opposite approach.

182
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,880
So, the meringue,
how long will it be cooking for?

183
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,760
The plain meringue would be very
likely a good 40 minutes in there.

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,760
40 minutes? They want it to be firm.

185
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,640
Seems like they're in control.

186
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,640
We'll see, we'll see if the control
has been kept.

187
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
Exactly.

188
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,400
So that bakes,
and I try to make mousse, chocolate.

189
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,080
And meringue.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
Folding in the meringue.

191
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,840
I think they're looking for
that light, airy mousse.

192
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,400
To retain the lightness
of their mousse,

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,840
it's essential they keep the air in
by folding it gently.

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,680
I'm not sure it should look like
that, but...today is guess day.

195
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,440
Too rough, and they risk reducing it
to a liquid.

196
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,160
Is that some of your mousse there?
Yes.

197
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,520
Is it all right?

198
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,280
Very pleasant. This is almost
as good as Angel Delight.

199
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
Chefs, you are halfway through.

200
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,040
Mike, I'm happy.
We need to crack on.

201
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,760
Sam, look at this.
They need a bit more.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
It's a bit time consuming, but...

203
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,560
For those with meringues baked,
the build can begin.

204
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,920
We can start layering.
And now is the time to push.

205
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,400
You have to be pretty quick.

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,920
Once complete,
their gateaus are put to rest.

207
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,920
What do we see?

208
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,320
But Emmanuel and Sam
have fallen behind.

209
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
HE SIGHS

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
The meringue is overcooked.

211
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,520
Sorry, Sam. I'm going to place
chocolate on the top gently.

212
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,640
Like, to hold it together.

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,320
It's too late to remake a meringue.

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
Under pressure.

215
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
Definitely under pressure.

216
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,360
You want me to make
the meringue again?

217
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,400
OK, go for it.
You've got the ingredients.

218
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
Chefs, you've got an hour left.

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,520
Yes. It'll be very, very tight.

220
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,320
As Emmanuel and Sam start again,

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,880
the other teams push on with
their stands.

222
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,480
Oh, BLEEP.

223
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,920
Start focusing on the decoration,
the stand -

224
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,240
it needs to be done
as soon as possible.

225
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
Cool beans.

226
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,520
Don't say that again.

227
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
Apparently it's not cool
to say cool beans.

228
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,240
You're not 14 years old.

229
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,200
Last week, first place.

230
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,000
Like, confidence levels, high?

231
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,640
Well, it's something I've never
really done, so struggling.

232
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,360
Good luck, guys.

233
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
Under pressure, of course.

234
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,240
Meringue is a major part
of the whole dessert.

235
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,800
It is what it is. Which isn't ideal.

236
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,160
Has the meringue got to you?
A bit, yeah. It's annoying that,

237
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,840
you know, this has happened.
Do you reckon you'll finish on time?

238
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,640
I mean, your meringues are in there.

239
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
How long does meringues
take to cook? 37 minutes.

240
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,680
Oh...

241
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,160
Chefs, you have half an hour left.

242
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
Half an hour, chefs.

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,000
Their gateaus aren't all they
have to worry about.

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,280
Now the designs for their stands
will be put to the test.

245
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,560
Hideko and Theo,
how are you feeling?

246
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
A bit in a rush. Feeling stressed?

247
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,320
Yeah. Big problem.
Stability.

248
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,240
Construction comes with
its own challenges.

249
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,640
If they happen to drop...
I hope it doesn't. You know...

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,200
Obviously we don't want it to drop.
It's not going to drop.

251
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,880
Yeah, yeah. Unless you jinx it.

252
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,880
The more components they have,
the more joins to make.

253
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,720
Literally shaking like a leaf.

254
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,320
And the more chances
the whole thing could collapse...

255
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,440
Hopefully stable.

256
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,040
Not confident.

257
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,000
..bringing the gateau with it.

258
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
SIGHS

259
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
BLEEP! It's the pressure -
the pressure is getting to me.

260
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,480
The meringue - need to get it done.

261
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,680
Wait, it's going to break.

262
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,120
You totes got a money shot then.

263
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
The bottom bit broke off. BLEEP.

264
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
Michael. I'm scared.

265
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,560
We're just actually waiting for
that meringue.

266
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,720
It will go right. That meringue
is going to be right.

267
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
It has to be.

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
This is broken.

269
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,480
I'm going to hide it.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,680
It's very messy.

271
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,080
Chefs, you have 15 minutes
remaining, 15 minutes.

272
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
Ridiculous.

273
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
You OK?

274
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
Yeah. I don't know...

275
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
Stability...

276
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,200
Oh, that's really gone out.

277
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,800
I don't like it.
We've gone a bit too static.

278
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
Seems to be all right.

279
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,000
Obviously, before, it looked
all right last time, so...

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,120
..we'll find out in about
ten minutes, I suppose.

281
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,880
Chefs, you have ten minutes left
for your Feuille D'...

282
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,760
Autumn cakes
to be finished.

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,200
Needs to cool down. So I'm working
on the decoration for the cake.

284
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
Definitely under pressure.

285
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,680
Rosace and chocolate band
for four, for finishing.

286
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,960
So the band is not too bad.
I'm sure it's just a simple band.

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
Yeah, good.

288
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,280
It's just the rosace
which we're going to struggle with.

289
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
The rosace is made of
delicate ruffles

290
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,800
that are difficult to master.

291
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,560
Go, go, go, go, go.
If the teams don't work fast...

292
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
BLEEP! ..the chocolate will set.

293
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,400
The rosace doesn't really work.

294
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
BLEEP.

295
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
It said do quickly.

296
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,680
Oh, God. BLEEP!

297
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,360
Trying to get at least
something to put on top.

298
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,280
So all these chocolates squigglies,
from...

299
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
Don't eat them, we need them.

300
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,120
You were just about to put that
in your mouth, weren't you?

301
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,800
Don't you finger the chocolate.

302
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
That looks good.

303
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,320
It's just now about cracking on
and getting things done.

304
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,680
Chefs, you have one minute left,
just one minute.

305
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
Come on, baby.

306
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,960
So fragile.

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,680
We've got to make something
out of nothing, basically.

308
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,920
I got one chance.

309
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,840
We're not conformists.

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,080
I'm not sure it should look
like that,

311
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,360
but I have to give them something.

312
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,760
Chefs, your time is up.

313
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,320
Your Secret Recipe Challenge
is over.

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
It stands...just about.

315
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,760
Four Feuille D'automne

316
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,480
and four exquisite stands, designed
and built in three and a half hours.

317
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
Benoit and Cherish await them.

318
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,000
I really like the way you interplay
your stand.

319
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,560
You lift up the height, and compared
to the rest of the contestants,

320
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,160
you stand out, for this.

321
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
Thank you.

322
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,400
However, we can see that you
struggled a little bit

323
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,560
with the ruffle.

324
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,880
It's not what we're looking for.

325
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,400
Yeah, it is like wood shavings
or wood chips.

326
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
It's autumn, autumn.

327
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,520
Yeah, it's autumn, all right, yeah.

328
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,480
Hopefully it will taste a little bit
better than it looks.

329
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
Well, it's not great news.

330
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,760
It's not a chocolate mousse.

331
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,200
It's closer to a kind of a sticky,
ganachey, sweet thing.

332
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
Our meringue is undercooked.
As you can see, it is soft.

333
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
I didn't enjoy eating this.

334
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,000
It's very slimy for me.

335
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
Sorry.

336
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,840
From far, it's a very expensive
and premium cake.

337
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,080
That's from far. Stay over there,
then!

338
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,320
LAUGHTER

339
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,960
Get back!

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
SHE EXCLAIMS

341
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,400
When I walk closer
to look at the cake,

342
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,440
all I can see is just two disks,
three balls - it's very safe.

343
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,320
This is not as elegant as a proper
rosace, but they are there,

344
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
there are plenty of them.

345
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,720
That meringue is not baked enough,
but at least you've got crispiness,

346
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,240
so I can eat that.

347
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,480
Chocolate mousse is so dense,
is so gummy.

348
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,600
It's not enjoyable eating this
slice of cake.

349
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,200
I will start with the stand.

350
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
The base gives a nice little funky
effect. The flower,

351
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,000
the technique is
great, so well done.

352
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,160
The ruffle looks quite appealing.

353
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,320
For that, I think you did very well.

354
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
The chocolate mousse is pleasant.

355
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,160
I enjoyed eating your meringue.

356
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
Well-baked as well. You managed to
control your time enough to be able

357
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,000
to bounce back and make a mistake
and fix your mistake.

358
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,840
Thank you very much. Thank you.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,120
You managed to serve us
the gateau.

360
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,640
Well, I think for positive sides,
that's about all that I can say.

361
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,760
Yeah. First of all, the stand I
think is very structured.

362
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,280
I was hoping for more from both of
you.

363
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,040
Mm-hm. The ruffle, you came up a bit
short, there's not enough.

364
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,360
But at least do plenty of this, and
try to make a bouquet. Not finished.

365
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,600
And a little bit of chocolate mousse
to cap that meringue

366
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,320
is part of what
makes a nice Feuille D'automne.

367
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,320
Chocolate mousse is quite heavy.

368
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,600
The meringue is uncooked, so, sorry,
can't eat this.

369
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,520
Meringues - come on. This is our
trade, this is what we do.

370
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,800
We do meringues. Not working for me,
thank you.

371
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,880
OK. Thank you.

372
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,160
No problem.

373
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,440
Oh, God, this was a bad idea,
to come on this show.

374
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
Whose idea was it? Yours.

375
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,040
Yeah, we feel disappointed, a bit,
because, you know, again,

376
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,280
like we say, we're professionals,
so...

377
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,640
Well, we're trying
to be professionals.

378
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,200
I'm really good at fishing,
so I might take that up.

379
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,880
The Showpiece is such a big part of
it that that can be a game-changer.

380
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,760
You can have a rubbish day today,
do an amazing Showpiece,

381
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
and you're number one.

382
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,080
Constructing a Showpiece entirely
from chocolate will require so many

383
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,880
elements that the teams have been
given a "golden hour" to temper and

384
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,680
prepare anything that needs to set
overnight.

385
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,080
Who do you sense is most in danger?

386
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,280
Well, our friends from the Sweet Art
Lab can actually think

387
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,680
outside the box, but when it's about
delivering the classics,

388
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,440
they seem to struggle a little.

389
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,680
As for me, I'm worried about
St David's Hotel.

390
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,520
Visual-wise, I was very disappointed
with what they produced today.

391
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,120
Resorts World did so well last week.

392
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,360
But obviously they struggle.

393
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
If they want to go forward in this
competition,

394
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
they will certainly
have to raise their game.

395
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,720
So, one of the most attractive
gateaux was Hilton Park Lane.

396
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
They did quite well.

397
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,360
But, you know, we've seen
the other teams bounce back.

398
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,440
Everything is to play for.
It's showtime.

399
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,400
LAMBS BLEAT

400
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,080
Good morning, chefs.

401
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,840
We hope you all have recovered from
yesterday's Secret Recipe Challenge.

402
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,680
Judges, please tell us what you've
chosen for today's Showpiece.

403
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,560
Well, chefs, today we would like you
to make a Showpiece around the theme

404
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,760
of "masked ball."

405
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,760
Your Showpiece must include
two different types

406
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,240
of moulded and filled
chocolate, for eight in total.

407
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,480
Your Showpiece must have
at least one moving part.

408
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,560
Can the moving part be someone's
face,

409
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
as they're stuffing it
in their gobs?

410
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,200
Absolutely not.

411
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,520
Chefs, you had one golden hour
last night to prepare,

412
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,880
and you have four more hours
to complete today's challenge.

413
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,960
Your time starts now.

414
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
Right.

415
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,280
Obviously a lot to do,

416
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,920
but if we push on
we should be fine.

417
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,360
You want this? Yeah. Thank you.

418
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
So now I've just got to do the mask.

419
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,920
I'm just coating it with a bit of
chocolate.

420
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
Since the 16th century,
masked balls have occupied

421
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,440
a hallowed place on the calendars of
kings, queens

422
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,320
and nobility across Europe.

423
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,600
A masked ball is like an elegant,
naughty party.

424
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,120
I'd like to go to a masked ball.

425
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,120
It sounds quite fun.

426
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,680
I don't like dressing up.

427
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,520
I'm not a fan of parties, to be
fair.

428
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,200
Yeah, right.

429
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,120
The teams must channel all
that glamour and sophistication into

430
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,600
immaculate chocolate Showpieces
that evoke these spectacular events.

431
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,720
The mask needs to have details
beyond imaginations.

432
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,200
We want to see
a lot of extravagance.

433
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,520
We want to have fun.

434
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,080
We want to see movement,
we want to see music.

435
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,360
I want the chef to be creative
and innovative.

436
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,720
I want to see glitter,
champagne popping up.

437
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,200
Take me to the ball.

438
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,280
Along with their Showpieces, they
must produce 48 flawless bonbons

439
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,600
that are no less decadent
than the parties themselves.

440
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,320
We've tried and tested the favours.
I think they work.

441
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
Obviously the judges might have
a different opinion.

442
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,040
Chocolate bonbon is all about
making sure those little shapes

443
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,720
are cast perfectly.

444
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,640
They need to tango on my
palate and give me a bit of

445
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,360
cha-cha-cha.

446
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,920
You have some champagne shower.

447
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,280
# Drama! #

448
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,880
Someone shake it all.

449
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,000
Sorry, Hideko. It's OK.

450
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,600
All the teams spent their
golden hour casting elements

451
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,040
for their Showpiece.

452
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,120
Now we need to see
how it's coming out.

453
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,280
Always quite a challenging moment.

454
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,960
Need a hand, Hideko? No, it's OK.

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
And for Hideko, now is the moment
of truth.

456
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
This is me.

457
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
This is a dimple.

458
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,480
Morning, guys. Good morning.
Morning.

459
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
Would you be able to tell us a bit
more about that Showpiece

460
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
you are creating for us today? Yes.

461
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
So, it's going to be
like a ballroom.

462
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,560
These stairs going
behind the Showpiece,

463
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,640
and it's going to be
Hideko's on the top.

464
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,800
She cast her own face overnight.

465
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
A beautiful face.

466
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,360
So what's the moving part going to
be? Fans on top of the face,

467
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,280
so like a fan. Yes.

468
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,080
When it... Like a feeling.
I've seen it in films.

469
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,800
Inside the ballroom
will be two types of bonbons -

470
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,600
a white chocolate, filled with
strawberry rose gel

471
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
and champagne ganache,

472
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,680
and a gold-flecked dark chocolate

473
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,720
filled with yuzu gel
and sake ganache.

474
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
Can we taste some sake now?

475
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,240
Yes, of course, if you want to.

476
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
It's made from rice, is it?

477
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
Fermented rice.

478
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
Mm.

479
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,840
Oh!

480
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,080
I don't have enough hairs
on my chest for that.

481
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,200
Oh, come on - it's...

482
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Darryl and Bharat are also
hitting the bottle.

483
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,160
This is the main structure
for the Showpiece.

484
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,160
It's the shape of a champagne
bottle.

485
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,640
We're going to have a rotating mask
and some feathers coming out.

486
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,440
Below their rotating mask will sit
24 white-flecked

487
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,960
dark chocolate bonbons

488
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,720
filled with a sweet caramel
and passion fruit gel.

489
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,520
Alongside will sit 24
white chocolates,

490
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,240
layered with white chocolate
ganache and champagne gel.

491
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,920
Are you doing anything else, to kind
of bring the champagne idea?

492
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,520
Because champagne, when it's
actually being transformed into

493
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,400
a gel, it tastes more like wine
as opposed to the champagne element.

494
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,520
Yes, we've tried to boost it.

495
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,800
With what? With some citric acid
to bring back the flavour

496
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,960
of the champagne, because otherwise
it is quite flat, yeah.

497
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,240
This just makes me
starting to tango.

498
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
Every Showpiece needs a base, and
the teams can make them

499
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
up to a metre wide.

500
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,440
And Emmanuel and Sam are using
the full width to take the mask back

501
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,840
to its spiritual home.

502
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,960
We're doing a sort of Venice-themed
Showpiece.

503
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
We've got a water as our base,
so we thought,

504
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,160
why not incorporate one of our
bonbons with the water?

505
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,240
So we've gone for a sort of
waved effect.

506
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,240
Their waved-effect bonbons
will be layered

507
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,920
with white chocolate liquorice
ganache, and cherry gel.

508
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,960
They will also serve 24
dark chocolate bonbons

509
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,680
filled with caramel and
blood orange gel.

510
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,960
Venice have got the most beautiful,
elegant and impressive masks

511
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,640
in the world.

512
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Now, if you went for this theme of
Venice, the mask needs to make it.

513
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,880
Will you take me there?
I would. Tomorrow we go.

514
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,240
Can I not come? You can.

515
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,760
You can. You will be dancing
all day long.

516
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,320
Each team's Showpiece must
incorporate a moving part.

517
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
That's for the movement
in the middle, with the mask.

518
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,720
I'm making the fan moving, always,
like a feather, moving.

519
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,280
While most are opting for
battery-operated motion...

520
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
We've actually brought a toy tank.

521
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
We'll have the boat on it, and it's
going to go around the water.

522
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,120
Michael and Rebekah's design
is a little less dynamic.

523
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,400
We've gone for somebody getting
ready to go to a ball,

524
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
so we've done a vanity table.

525
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,800
The drawer that's in the front of
the dressing table,

526
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,880
you'll be able to pull out, so
technically we have moving parts.

527
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,400
Technically.

528
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,480
Inside their vanity table will be
white chocolate bonbons

529
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,000
lined with strawberry puree
and champagne gel,

530
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,880
and dark chocolate bonbons
layered with passion fruit,

531
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,320
honey and white chocolate.

532
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
Hi, Rebekah. Hi, Michael.

533
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,640
Hello. Hello. Now, Michael, I heard
a rumour you have an alter ego -

534
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,080
is that correct? I used to have an
alter ego, yeah.

535
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,960
Years ago now, I used to be
a drag performer.

536
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,720
Really?

537
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,280
Her name was Titty McVitie.

538
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,000
What sort of outfits
did she go for?

539
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,000
Any ones that would fit her.
She's a big girl.

540
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,160
Chefs, you've had one hour.

541
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,600
You have three hours left
until the masked ball.

542
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,960
I hope I get to go, I don't have to
stay here sweeping up all the time.

543
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
My fairy godmother's here.

544
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
God!

545
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm starting on the bonbons.

546
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,320
A bonbon, while small in size,

547
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,680
is comprised of many elements that
give it a distinct high-end appeal.

548
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,920
And first on the list
is a beautiful exterior.

549
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,160
Hand-held screwdriver.

550
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
HE IMITATES POWER TOOL

551
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,240
I'm going to use it to make
a swirly effect.

552
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,000
It gives it a really fast motion,
and that's when you get clean lines.

553
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,600
You can't do that with your finger.

554
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,000
We do like a gadget.

555
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,680
Next, a finely cast outer shell.

556
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,960
It's very flimsy.

557
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,680
Structural chocolate engineers.

558
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,040
I'm now going to fill the gel
and the ganache.

559
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,720
At every turn, the eating experience
is paramount,

560
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,520
and every bit as important
as the look.

561
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,920
Do you think I should put champagne
on the bottom, or at the top?

562
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,400
Top, so when they bite it's the soft
gel, then ganache.

563
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,640
Each layer requires skill
and finesse.

564
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,480
I'm just capping the chocolates now,
spreading it out

565
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,080
with a palette knife.
I like to go as fast as we can.

566
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,160
Speed is of the essence.

567
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,560
Move too slowly and the chocolate
will set...

568
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
This is not good.

569
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,280
..leaving an untidy
and imprecise bonbon.

570
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
WHACK!

571
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,440
I found a problem on the chocolate.
Slightly thick.

572
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,720
Kind of break that...

573
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
And the difficulties
don't end there.

574
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,920
With bonbons setting, attention
switches to their Showpieces.

575
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,320
Lots of people watching.

576
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,960
But Sam's extra-wide watery base...

577
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
It was a bad idea to stick that
BLEEP board on there.

578
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,360
..may have already gone down the
plughole.

579
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
I knew we shouldn't have done it.

580
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,960
Chefs, you have one hour left.

581
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
That's one hour.

582
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,840
BLEEP.

583
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
Is this on?

584
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
Time is starting to run out.

585
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,560
We need to get our heads down and
just get on with what we need to do.

586
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,200
I have to assemble.

587
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,600
While most of the teams start to
bring their showpieces to life,

588
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,800
for Sam and Emmanuel,

589
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
a shattered base has left their
Venice dream high and dry.

590
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,320
It's going to be a fun puzzle.

591
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,080
I'm going to need to be good
at jigsaws right now.

592
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,080
This is one of the challenges
that I am so excited with.

593
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
Masks and ball.

594
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,640
The Hideko has actually used their
own face for that mask.

595
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,040
I hope she colours it and she makes
it quite flamboyant and fun as well.

596
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,760
Daryl and Bharat.

597
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,160
They describe their main structure
as a champagne bottle.

598
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,400
It's closer to a bottle of water,
wouldn't you say?

599
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,280
But, hey, it may work with
the scheme of things.

600
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,720
Rebekah and Michael, what you think
of them?

601
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,640
It depends. The devil, sometimes,
is in the details.

602
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,560
Yes. The question with them,

603
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
will there be enough details on
their showpiece?

604
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,120
And we've got our team from
The Hilton Park Lane.

605
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,200
Obviously, they are a little bit
under pressure.

606
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,840
They have to rapido, rapido and move
on, move on and faster, now.

607
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,360
Just a little bit of blue pucker
right over the top.

608
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,920
Right, that's it. Try and have time
to build something nice.

609
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,440
Chefs, you have half an hour left.
Half an hour, chefs.

610
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,960
We, we are getting close now
to time.

611
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
We need to focus on getting
finished.

612
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
Not...

613
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,760
I need this before it sets.

614
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,280
Right, go on. Go on.

615
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
That's fine.

616
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,160
Ooh! What are you looking for?

617
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,400
The balls.

618
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't know what's in it.

619
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,840
Oh, one short.

620
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,840
You definitely need a steady hand.

621
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,200
BLEEP.

622
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,160
What that? That's a Wispa bar,
is that, you're sticking on
the top there?

623
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,720
Oh, I love Wispa bars. I do. What's
your favourite chocolate?

624
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,120
Twix. Twix? Mm. Really? Yeah.

625
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,520
Emmanuel. Why not?

626
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,400
Pastry chef? Hilton Park Lane? Well,
you know. Sorry, guys, you know.

627
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,080
Favourite chocolate bar? Twix.

628
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,840
Yes. Do you know what I really
fancy eating? What's that? Something
in the shape of a human face.

629
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,520
Have you got anything? Wait, wait.

630
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,400
Why don't you try this one on? Oh,
can I try this on?

631
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
Yes. Obviously, it chocolate.

632
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
Oh. It's like Jim Carrey.

633
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,800
Ah. Front and centre of every
showpiece is the mask.

634
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,360
Yeah. That chocolate. Oh, BLEEP.

635
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,840
Attaching finely cast hand-painted
chocolate requires a delicate touch.

636
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
Breathe, breathe.

637
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,360
The slightest wrong move...

638
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,680
Riskiest part of the day right now.

639
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,800
..and all their hard work will be
destroyed.

640
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,000
OK, OK, OK, you can let go.

641
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,840
I let go?

642
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,080
Yeah. Just freeze my hand.
I don't care.

643
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,760
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.
That's ten minutes left.

644
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,840
BLEEP.

645
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,800
Could be a lot neater,
but we're really pushed for time.

646
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,400
Ooh, sha la la.

647
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,960
Chefs, you have five minutes left.
That's five minutes.

648
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,720
Got it, got it. Go ahead.

649
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,080
You've got this. I'm going to have
to drop it and slide it.

650
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,880
BLEEP. On the edge of the table.

651
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,720
There? Yeah.

652
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,120
Put the mask there because I
wasn't happy with the writing

653
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,400
that's actually
on the mirror, to kind of cover it.

654
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,400
Can we scrape that Cocoa bit off and
try to write something better on the
mirror or no?

655
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Just painting the black line for
our gondola to follow.

656
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,640
Oop... BLEEP!

657
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
BLEEP.

658
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,600
Chefs, you have one minute left.
That's one minute.

659
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
Feel the pressure.

660
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,760
We, er, need to get a move on.

661
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,600
Chefs, your time is up.

662
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,840
Uh-oh, uh-oh. Please step away from
your showpieces.

663
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,240
So, it's OK, it's OK. Don't worry.

664
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
That was mental.

665
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,960
That's clever.

666
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,680
Don't melt.

667
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,200
Them chocolates are nice.

668
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,840
Just...

669
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,600
Four stunning masked ball showpieces
in just five hours.

670
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,280
But who will earn their place in the
final stages of the competition

671
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
and who will fail to impress?

672
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,880
A bit of fun, we bring.

673
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,160
That is cool. I'm going to be there
all day, I think.

674
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
I like the little wiggling gondola.

675
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,440
Your violin, how you bring it alive
is because how you incorporate the

676
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,160
colour in. Really nicely done.

677
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,280
Overall, you have a great story,
but, for me,

678
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
your mask is not strong enough.

679
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,520
I would have looked the mask to have
more drama.

680
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,200
Remind us what we have.

681
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,360
Cherry gel and then a liquorice and
cherry ganache.

682
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,040
Visually, very appealing.

683
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,600
And it actually looks like a wave.

684
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,440
The eating sensation is
quite intriguing.

685
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,040
The cherry and the liquorice kick in
and I actually quite like it.

686
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,360
And the other one is a blood orange
and caramel.

687
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,320
The shell is very thin and elegant,
but it's too creamy.

688
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,080
I want the ganache to have a
little more texture.

689
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
Thank you very much.

690
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,520
HE EXHALES

691
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
Oh, God.

692
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,080
Could you show us your moving part,
please?

693
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,680
The drawer opens.

694
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,000
OK, all right.

695
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,840
Also, the lid comes off the
chocolate box. Oh, OK.

696
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,360
I was a bit disappointed because it
was a little bit bare on the table.

697
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,200
And then, looking at your mirror,

698
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,800
could you please tell us what is the
writing behind?

699
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,200
It did say "Gone to the ball, XOXO",

700
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,840
but I wasn't happy with it.
That's why I put the mask there.

701
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,840
So that was the proper use of the
mask.

702
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,840
It actually has masked!
It actually masked!

703
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,720
Shall we taste? The red one is
a strawberry and champagne.

704
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,200
Visually, it's not too bad.

705
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,640
You put the red in because you want
to bring in the strawberry.

706
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,440
Strawberry, I could not taste it
at all and it's a bit powdery.

707
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,520
Can you remind us what's inside
this one?

708
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,840
It's a passion fruit ganache.

709
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,160
It doesn't look like an exciting
chocolate to look at.

710
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
It's a little bit sad.

711
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,720
But, overall, the casting of the
chocolate,

712
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,480
it looks like you cast it nicely.

713
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,040
Your passion fruit is fragrant.

714
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,400
Yeah. Thank you very much.

715
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,080
My first impression is,
very impressive.

716
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,520
I really like the way you paint the
mask.

717
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,720
Very nice. Neatness of work has
improved tremendously.

718
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960
I remember the first round,
where you almost went,

719
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,440
and this is where it needs to be
if you want to be in the final.

720
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
Yeah.

721
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,120
Remind us what you have inside your
chocolates for us.

722
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,520
Yes, so, we have the champagne,
white chocolate and raspberry.

723
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,200
I really like the copper that you
put in,

724
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,640
the little gadget that you use.

725
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,880
A screwdriver.
It's quite a nice technique.

726
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,240
I am not too keen.

727
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,840
It just doesn't taste like
champagne.

728
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,720
It tastes like cheap wine now.

729
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,440
There is another one.
Passion fruit and caramel.

730
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,960
I really like the bottom.

731
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,800
I think that is really
beautifully done.

732
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,360
This one, I would go back to
any day of the week.

733
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,520
Passion fruit glaze.

734
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,400
Lovely. I start to cha-cha-cha!

735
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,120
Ooh, it's beautiful!

736
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
Wow, it's so beautiful. I love it.

737
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,360
The passion fruit just kicks in with
your caramel.

738
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
Sensational. Well done.
Good job, guys.

739
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,520
Thank you. Thank you.
Well done, guys.

740
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,040
It's moving.

741
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,880
Yeah. You see height,
you see a red mask.

742
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,440
A very dramatic piece, I think.

743
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,360
Is this a chocolate cup? Yes.

744
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,720
Would you like champagne?

745
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
Yes, please. They've given her some
booze.

746
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
That's clever.

747
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,320
Whoa! Oh!

748
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,360
Oh, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo!
LAUGHTER

749
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,800
Uh, good idea?

750
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,160
Please.

751
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,520
Well, a good effort that you cast
your own face.

752
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,120
However, the mask reminds me of
Lady Gaga, the raw beef dress.

753
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,240
LAUGHTER

754
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,040
Straight away. The finishing
everywhere is really rough.

755
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,920
If you want to progress in this
competition,

756
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
you will need to address your
neatness.

757
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,080
We've seen that on too many
occasions with you guys.

758
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,840
Shall we taste? That one is a
yuzu jam

759
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,800
and a dark chocolate and sake
ganache.

760
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,000
The yuzu is very fragrant.

761
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
If anything, I'm lacking a
little bit of sake,

762
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,560
because if it's in the ganache,
we've got a lot of bitterness.

763
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,280
Next one. Champagne,
white chocolate and rose.

764
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,200
The ganache comes in with the
champagne very, very subtle.

765
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,120
However, when I turn it back,

766
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,960
I think the casting
was not properly done.

767
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,720
The casting is wrong. It is all over
the shop, but I mean

768
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,720
way out of even anything acceptable.

769
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,080
It makes it very difficult to enjoy.

770
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,360
Mmm.

771
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,920
Can I take the bottle of champagne?

772
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,120
I'll have a proper glass.
Thank you. Thank you.

773
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,920
It couldn't be worse.
Couldn't be worse.

774
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,960
Based on both challenges,

775
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,040
Benoit and Cherish will now rank the
teams and only the top three will

776
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,920
take their place in the final stages
of the competition.

777
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,640
You don't enter a competition
to leave, you want to win it.

778
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,360
The other team is all big hotel,
big team.

779
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,640
We are only, like, a little company.

780
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,080
Yeah, it will be kind of a victory
to go through.

781
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,680
But it will obviously be a
tough judgment...

782
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
..so...we don't know.

783
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280
Hopefully, hopefully we stay.

784
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,320
OWL HOOTS

785
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,240
Benoit and Cherish have made their
decision.

786
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,600
The team in first place excelled in
both challenges,

787
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,200
especially in yesterday's
secret recipe challenge.

788
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,480
Congratulations...

789
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,440
..Emmanuel and Sam from
Hilton Park Lane.

790
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,640
You are through to the next stage in
the competition.

791
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,240
In second place are Darryl and
Bharat from Resorts World.

792
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,200
Congratulations -
you are also through.

793
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,160
Which leaves Michael and Rebekah
from St David's Hotel,

794
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,480
and Hideko and Theo
from Sweet Art Lab.

795
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm not a massive fan of what I have
to do next

796
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,680
because you guys, honestly, are
amazing people, let alone chefs.

797
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,480
But, after much deliberation,

798
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,440
the judges decided that the team who
will be leaving us tonight is...

799
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,240
..Michael and Rebekah.

800
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,960
Well done. Well done.

801
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,080
We're disappointed to be going home,

802
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,880
but we've enjoyed
every minute of it,

803
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,240
so, yeah, like,
I wouldn't change it. We've done...

804
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,560
I'd change...change the
showpiece today, maybe!

805
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
Hey, you know, you've done yourself
proud.

806
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,320
You've worked hard. Oh, yeah.
You've worked hard.

807
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,600
You've worked so hard.

808
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,760
It's going to be weird going back to
normal life now.

809
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,040
Trying to build a little family
unit between us all.

810
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,160
Hopefully we always stay in
touch and keep on learning. Yep.

811
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,440
You've got good ideas.

812
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,680
I mean, originality is there.

813
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
I thought we would go out.

814
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,800
Passed through. Passed through
the next round.

815
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,520
Next time...

816
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,680
Go, go, go, go.

817
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,280
..the second set of heats begin.

818
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,800
Back, back, back, back.

819
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,400
With six brand-new
professional teams.

820
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,080
If it all goes wrong,
it's his fault.

821
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,560
Who will master the miniatures?

822
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,760
These are beaut.

823
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,600
And whose patisserie dreams...

824
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,920
Don't jinx it, don't jinx it!

825
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,360
..will end in a monumental mess?

826
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh, BLEEP!

827
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,800
I refuse to eat this.

828
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,120
That was brutal.

﻿1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,800
Hello, and welcome to Bake Off:
The Professionals.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,240
My name's Tom Allen.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,560
I'm Liam Charles. Four first names,
two really fun guys.

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,560
We're searching for Britain's best
professional pastry chefs.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,280
Well, I'm searching for happiness
but, sure, that too, why not?

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,800
And today we have six new teams
ready to impress.

7
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:18,480
Shall we go and meet them?
Oh, yes, let's! Isn't this fun!

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,320
Liam, you're like the Jamie Oliver
to my Patisserie Valerie.

9
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,320
Last time...

10
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:27,880
The first set of heats ended
with a nerve-shattering

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,280
showpiece challenge.

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,080
What the BLEEP.
Do you think it's going to hold?

13
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,480
And Sweetheart Lab, Hilton Park Lane
and Resorts World...

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:37,720
That's mental.

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,840
..Became the first teams to make
the final six.

16
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:43,200
Now we meet six brand-new teams...

17
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:45,880
We're nervous, definitely, but we're
ready for today. Go, go.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,800
I would say this is the
biggest thing I've done

19
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,000
in terms of patisserie.

20
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,080
..As they prepare to face the
judgment of world-renowned head

21
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,720
patissieres Benoit and Cherish.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,840
We will be watching you at
all times.

23
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,760
I'm scared for them.

24
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,920
..And two daunting challenges.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
I don't want to think about
the time now.

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,920
We're about to discover if any of
these teams...

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,280
These baps are beautiful.

28
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,520
..Have what it takes.

29
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,400
..To be crowned champions...
Finish up.

30
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,400
..Of Bake Off: The Professionals.

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:18,840
Yeah.

32
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Amazing.

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:33,720
Over the next two days,

34
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,560
these six new teams of professional
pastry chefs

35
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,040
will have to compete at the highest
level to earn a place

36
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,400
in the next round of
the competition.

37
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,680
Good luck.

38
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,240
Hello, chefs, and welcome to the
Bake Off: The Professionals kitchen.

39
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
You're here to test yourself against
the best pastry chefs in the UK,

40
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,680
and only your very best will do.

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,640
So, the judges' first challenge,
miniature classics.

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,360
A true test of traditional
patisserie skills.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,640
You must produce two batches,
24 of each,

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,120
and each pastry within those batches
must be absolutely identical.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,960
I've chosen Pont Neuf.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,400
It's a French classical pastry,
which has a puff pastry case

47
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,920
filled with an apple compote, creme
patissiere and choux pastry.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,520
Though it's a very
simple compilation,

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
it is technically challenging.

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,520
And Cherish. Chefs, I've
chosen Tarte au Citron.

51
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,600
I want to see this beautiful,
delicate shell

52
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:48,320
with delicious filling that captures
the amazing taste of lemon.

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,960
Be warned, chefs, this is one of my
all-time favourites.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
Do not disappoint me.

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
I don't know about the
chefs, Cherish,

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
but I would never disappoint you.

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,840
Wouldn't dare. So, chefs,

58
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,520
you have three and a half hours and
your time starts now.

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,880
All right, we're on. Can you pass me
my sieve from down there?

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,320
Four eggs, caster sugar, butter.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
With 48 miniatures to produce in
just three and a half hours...

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
We've got a lot to do.

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,680
..Team management and organisation
will be key.

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
Watch your legs, watch your legs.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,440
We know what our plan is. We know
how we timed ourselves,

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
so that's what we're going to do.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,560
Brand-new heat, six new teams.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,960
I want the chefs to show me all they
have and put it out for me.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,880
What I would like to see is 24
innovative and creative

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
Tarte au Citron. It's made
from sablee, a sweet pastry casing,

71
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,800
and filled with a beautiful, silky
smooth, lemon filling.

72
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,600
They have to be precise, identical
and, most important,

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
I want them to put their own stamp
on the Tarte au Citron.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,400
The chefs will have to demonstrate
excellence at every step

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,560
of the bake if they're to meet the
judges' exacting standards.

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
Yeah, don't do it like this.

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,760
Just put all of it. That's
not even.

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
And team captain Mustapha
and his less experienced team-mate

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
are still feeling confident.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,520
We've got the skills. I know it's
a pressure,

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,120
but we'll make it happen for sure.

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,760
As well as being a sous pastry chef,
Mustapha also instructs

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,200
at the Clink, a charity that works
in prisons training inmates

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,160
for careers in fine dining after
their release.

85
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,800
He's chosen Kevin, a talented but
recent graduate of the Clink,

86
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
to join him in the competition.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,680
Mustapha's glazed domes with layers
of lemon madeleine sponge,

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,840
lemon meringue mousse,

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,440
lemon marmalade and lemon cream may
not look like a Tarte au Citron,

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,200
but it should certainly taste
like one.

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
I've played safe in here, honestly.

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,440
It's just all about the flavour.

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,520
For their flavours, Kelly and Katie
are going for something

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,200
a little more experimental.

95
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
We decided to put Earl Grey into it.

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,560
It's got some vanilla tones going
through it.

97
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,480
It's still quite citrusy, so I think
lemon is still the star attraction,

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,760
but you've just got this at the
back.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
As well, just this lovely,
vanilla-y, ooh.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
Kelly and Katie teach patisserie at
the renowned WI Cookery School,

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
and they're keen to prove there's
more to the WI

102
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,680
than just jam and Victoria sponge.

103
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,400
Their Tarte au Citron will see a
glazed lemon bavarois dome

104
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,600
surrounded by bergamot curd and, for
their tea flavoured gel

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,080
and sablee base, they're using no
ordinary Earl Grey.

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,560
It's a special blend.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,360
It's called Girly Grey.

108
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
Obviously, being an all girl
team as well,

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
we thought that was a
nice little...

110
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,920
Does it smell good?
A bit of fun there.

111
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
It's very citrusy.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,160
It smells very citrusy, so I see
the connection.

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
You know what I like about you?

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Girl power.

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,800
Definitely. Go, girl power!

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,440
Not going to disappoint me.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,160
Definitely not. Absolutely not.

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,440
Kelly and Katie aren't the only ones
relying on a bit of girl power.

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,880
I brought my daughter's ruler.

120
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,400
She doesn't know I've got it, but
it's the right width.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,080
As well as help from his daughter,

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,640
team captain, Graham, has enrolled
his boss, Dean.

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,880
The shoe's on the other foot this
time, so he'd better be nice to me.

124
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,680
I'm always nice to him, so...

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,840
This duo work at Silverstone,

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,760
and they're used to the pressure of
catering for thousands of people

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
from their kitchen above the
pit lane.

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,440
The mission is to put Silverstone on
the map for our food.

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,880
Might name a corner after you.

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
Yeah, maybe.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,640
Graham is placing a cube of lemon
curd embellished

132
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,720
with raspberry gel and meringue into
a freestanding pastry wheel.

133
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
At Silverstone, you have a lot of
big events, I imagine.

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
Yeah, we have the Grand Prix,
Classics, Moto GP.

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,600
Very stressful? Yeah, big-time.

136
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
When you've got a brigade of 30
chefs to look after,

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
it's quite different.

138
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
Dean, does he have tantrums
sometimes?

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,800
Er... Do a bit of both. Yeah, he
gets a bit shouty then walks off.

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
Great, well, I hope we get
to see that.

141
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,520
Yeah, you might do, you might not.

142
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,160
A bit of swearing, a bit of effing
and jeffing.

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,480
Yes. I've been told off for
my language before.

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,880
Lovely. Remember, it's not a public
vote, so it doesn't matter.

145
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,000
You can be a right BLEEP the whole
way through this competition.

146
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
No, it doesn't matter. You don't
have to make anyone like you.

147
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,520
Don't encourage him, please. Oh!

148
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,520
There's no risk of an outburst from
Slav and Maria.

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,320
We are a bit quiet, but that's how
we are working.

150
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
We are very quiet in general.

151
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
A bit unusual as chefs.

152
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,520
Slav and Maria work at boutique
chocolatiers R Chocolate,

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,720
creating bespoke delicacies.

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,080
Bing!

155
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,240
So Slav couldn't
resist incorporating

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,240
white chocolate feuilletine into
his lemon tart,

157
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,040
topping off lemon mousseline and a
lemon sablee disc.

158
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,520
Look how shiny my feuilletine is!

159
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,840
It's so shiny.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,280
Yeah, it is. That is our white
chocolate feuilletine,

161
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,560
which is very shiny. Good.

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,640
While most teams have opted for
contemporary designs,

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,920
Leanne and Roman are
taking no chances.

164
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,400
We're sticking to the classic.

165
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,800
It's what we do at work, so
hopefully they'll like it.

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,800
At only 23 and 26 years old,

167
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,720
Leanne and Roman from Hotel
Cafe Royal are the youngest team

168
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,800
in this heat of the competition.
Although it might look traditional,

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,000
they're giving their Tarte au
Citron's core flavour

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,560
a unique savoury twist by adding
beetroot and thyme

171
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
Italian meringues.

172
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,320
Beetroot, thyme and lemon? Last time
I had beetroot, thyme and lemon,

173
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,240
that was as a starter with
some vinaigrette.

174
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,440
I think the flavours together
will wow you.

175
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,960
Because I don't think you're
expecting it to taste nice,

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
but hopefully it will.

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,520
OK, beetroot and lemon.

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,920
What can I say? We shall see.

179
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,040
Thank you. See you later.

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,200
I'm not too sure if they
like our plan!

181
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,360
No, I don't think...

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,840
With tart cases baking...

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,960
These are my choux pastry
hula hoops.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
Hopefully they'll be fine. ..

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,000
..The teams need to use every minute
to perfect their fillings.

186
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,520
And Eddie and Mahshid are hoping to
boost their filling

187
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,920
with a touch of flower power.

188
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,120
On top, we've got a freestanding
lemon curd and hibiscus jelly to

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,640
really emphasise the flavour.

190
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,200
Eddie and Mahshid work at the world
famous Savoy in London.

191
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,680
They want to bring the elegance of
their afternoon tea

192
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,000
to the competition with Eddie's
delicately waved pastry base,

193
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
topped off with a piped lemon curd,

194
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,360
lemon sponge and hibiscus and
blackcurrant infused jelly cubes.

195
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,040
How are you going to set your
hibiscus jelly?

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,440
With gelatine. So you're using a
fish gelatine?

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
Fish gelatine. Do you think you have
enough time to set your gelatine?

198
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
Yes, it will set. I hope so.

199
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,280
Speaking of time, shall we
let them crack on?

200
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
I think we should. I think
that's a good idea.

201
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,360
We should come back
later. Come on, guys.

202
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Good luck, chefs.

203
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,040
Unless they set their
fillings quickly,

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
the teams will run out of time to
assemble their parts.

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,880
Plus freezer, plus freezer. Go
quickly, quickly.

206
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,400
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,160
But, unlike all the other teams,

208
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,920
Leanne and Roman plan to cook
their filings in their tart cases,

209
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,320
so they'll need to find extra time
for a second bake.

210
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,320
As soon as the tarts are part baked,
I can add the tart mix.

211
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
It's all about the cooking.

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,640
Chefs, you have an hour and
a half left.

213
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,840
Push, push a little bit, please.

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
Yes, chef.

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
Instead of setting their
fillings firm,

216
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,680
Eddie has accidentally
frozen them solid.

217
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
We're going to be BLEEP now.

218
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,200
We need to restart our stuff.

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
We're going to have to,

220
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,440
because I'm not going to serve
that to the judges.

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
It's not acceptable. I need to crack
on with this otherwise we're not

222
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,240
going to be able to serve anything.
Where's that lemon curd recipe?

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
Be careful.

224
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
Can you get this door?

225
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
Yeah, I'll get it.

226
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
It could be better.

227
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,280
It could be a lot better. Because
of the freezer situation,

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,640
I have to remake the lemon curd and
the hibiscus jelly for the tart.

229
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,640
It's getting hot in here now, or is
it just me?

230
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
It's hot.

231
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,120
If trying to impress with perfect
lemon tarts wasn't tough enough...

232
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,920
The teams also have to tackle a
batch of Benoit's classic Pont Neuf.

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,520
A classical Pont Neuf,
very traditional

234
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,640
French little recipe, which I love.

235
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,080
So, first step, the puff pastry.

236
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,000
The pastry needs to be perfect.

237
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,200
Line your pastry case, a little
layer of apple compote,

238
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,280
the combination of pastry, cream and
choux pastry, pipe in a nice blob.

239
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,240
On the top, a lovely puff
pastry cross,

240
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,640
bake in the oven until
nice and golden.

241
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,680
Glaze with redcurrant jam, icing
sugar in the other two corners.

242
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
They all have to be perfect
and precise.

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,320
That will be the challenge.

244
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
It may seem simple, but Benoit will
expect a perfect execution

245
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,000
of every element of this classic.

246
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
We're both WI members.

247
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,680
If we suck at jam, it's going
to be very...

248
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,280
Embarrassing. Very embarrassing.

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,800
And, although those elements are
familiar, the Pont Neuf

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
itself may not be.

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,840
How many times have you tried this?

252
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
Er... About once.

253
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,960
Once? Once. Once!

254
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
You've tried the Pont Neuf once?!

255
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,560
That's right. And did it work the
first time?

256
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,080
Yeah. Beginner's luck?

257
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,280
Don't jinx it, don't jinx it!

258
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,960
We shouldn't say that. I know
you're going to nail it again.

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,680
Yes. I'm going to smash it.
Come on, compote.

260
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,840
Come on. Cook, cook.

261
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,280
Cooking apples for a compote is a
delicate balancing act.

262
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,760
It's looking beautiful.

263
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,120
If the fruit isn't reduced enough
now, when baked later,

264
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,080
excess moisture will turn to steam,

265
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,840
causing air pockets in the centre
of the pastries.

266
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
Compote's done. Well done.

267
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,280
Thank you. I like some praise.

268
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,240
In a Pont Neuf on top of the compote
is a more unusual filling...

269
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,720
It's a choux pastry and creme
pat mixed together.

270
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
..That Graham is struggling to
thicken.

271
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
It's not BLEEP cooking.

272
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,960
It's on, quick, you're behind, mate.

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
No, we're all right.

274
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,320
We are under the pressure
now, for sure.

275
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
It's all good in the hood.

276
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
Once assembled, the Pont Neuf will
need at least 30 minutes

277
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,400
to bake correctly.

278
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,640
But having lost time on their
fillings, and with just 40 minutes,

279
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,160
remaining Graham and Dean's
still aren't ready for the oven.

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
How are they? Too thin? It's not too
thin, mate.

281
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
It's all working quite nicely.

282
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,120
And Leanne and Roman still need to
bake their Tarte au Citron filling.

283
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,040
I'm not relaxed. The Pont Neuf is
going to take 20 minutes.

284
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
This is going to take 20 minutes.

285
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,040
And we've got 35 minutes left.

286
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,640
So... Will try to get the glaze
ready for my lemon sauce.

287
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,600
If I'm lucky.

288
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,080
I know what you think about the
time now.

289
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,200
Yeah, we're right on the edge now.

290
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,280
Got to get this done and then, see
if we've got time to cook it.

291
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
You've got half an hour, everyone!

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,520
Half-an-hour, chefs!

293
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,800
Half-an-hour left! Really?

294
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,960
I hope you've got enough time to
finish everything.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
We're almost there.

296
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,280
Basically, it's the assembly that's
the time-consuming bit.

297
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
We're behind now.

298
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,840
Because we only have half an hour
left and the curd has not set.

299
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,720
These babs are beaut.

300
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
Thank you! 16, 18, 20, 22.

301
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,440
Yeah, all our elements are coming
together now.

302
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
It's just getting on the
plate really.

303
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,760
Mahshid has had just enough time to
remake her lemon curd.

304
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,000
We can use the lemon curd,
thank God. Yeah? Yeah.

305
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
Now we're completely in the BLEEP.

306
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,560
But now another team has fallen
foul of the freezer.

307
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,840
A vital element of Kelly and
Katie's tart,

308
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
the tea flavoured gel has
frozen solid.

309
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
The gel isn't going very well.

310
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,560
Oh, crap. Should we just leave it?

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
Just leave it for now.

312
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,960
The piping will do.

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
Well it's going to have to do.
We have no other choice.

314
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
They're overcooked.

315
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,200
Ah, BLEEP. I don't want to be
here right now.

316
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,080
I'm not even joking.

317
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
So, the lemon tart overcooked.

318
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,720
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left!

319
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,440
15 minutes left!

320
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,800
You dropped one? Yeah,
I dropped one.

321
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,200
So we've only got one left.

322
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
We can only lose one more.

323
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,120
They need to cool.
Any more, they need more.

324
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
Or they're going to collapse.
Is it wrong, still?

325
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,240
No, no, no, it's not wrong.

326
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
Uniformity.

327
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
This is really pale. I'm sorry.

328
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,040
Go, go, go, go!

329
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,480
Chefs! You have one minute left!

330
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,240
We're not going to be able to put
the jam in.

331
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm scared for them. Oh, boy.

332
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
Come on, just go in.

333
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
Oh, BLEEP!

334
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,600
Chefs! Your time is up!

335
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,480
I'm so frustrated.

336
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
We're five minutes off of that.

337
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,440
That's all it was, five
BLEEP minutes.

338
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,680
Our six new teams now have to face
the judgment of Cherish and Benoit

339
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
for the very first time.

340
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,720
The Savoy,

341
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,800
could you please bring your
miniature classics to the table?

342
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,400
We've got 24 Pont Neufs...

343
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,200
..nicely baked.

344
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
Really nicely baked.

345
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
Whoops.

346
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,000
Unfortunately, the pastry's
cooked on the outside,

347
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,200
the inside is seriously undercooked.

348
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,680
All because of your steam.

349
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
The challenge of this petit gateau
is management of that steam.

350
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
It's too acidic to my liking.

351
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,320
I agree with Cherish in principle.

352
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,600
It's maybe a little bit acidic

353
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,080
but, because of the acidity,
you've got a bit of freshness

354
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
which is what I was
looking for with the Pont Neuf.

355
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
Lemon tart.

356
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,040
Very innovative and creative,
this is what we're looking for.

357
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,160
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

358
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,680
You should be very proud of this,

359
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
of the way I see you rectified
your problem.

360
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,400
I was very impressed.

361
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Thank you.

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,760
I like your hibiscus jelly.

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,960
Works well with the lemon.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
I think it matches very well.

365
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,640
Your lemon and your blackcurrant
and hibiscus,

366
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
beautiful, well done.

367
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,400
Thank you very much. Thank you.

368
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,640
Ah, boobs!

369
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,600
With the Pont Neuf,
it's pretty rough on the edges.

370
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
We can't see the cross very well.

371
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,640
The jam doesn't look like a jam.

372
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,240
Oops.

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,640
A lot of steam inside. Mm.

374
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,440
Sorry, it's not cooked.
I just can't eat it.

375
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,480
The lemon tart. Shall we try? Oui.

376
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
You can see, basically,
it's not glazed.

377
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
It is very, very untidy.

378
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,880
It's actually pleasant. Mm.
I like that little sharpness.

379
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,800
There is that lovely ting, tinge,
how do you say that? Ting?

380
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,360
Zing. Zing. Tang.

381
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
Zing tang. Zing tang, new word.

382
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
Ah.

383
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,680
At least you don't have a large
pocket of steam.

384
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,120
But normally the texture
will make it slightly lighter.

385
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,080
It is not a Pont Neuf any more.

386
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,440
This is more like a flan.

387
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
I'll only try the apple.

388
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,000
As you can see, it is uncooked,
it will make my tummy upset.

389
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,760
Lemon tart. In terms of
presentation, you did very well.

390
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Really like the combination of your
sable with your mousseline,

391
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
and then finish up with the
feuilletine that you put.

392
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,680
Well done. Thank you.

393
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
Just a little bit disappointed
with your jam.

394
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,960
I thought your jam should be
a bit thicker.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,520
But there is some finesse.

396
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
Cross is neat.

397
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,600
In terms of flavour profile, we are
looking for a strong apple flavour,

398
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,080
a light vanilla texture of your

399
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,720
combined mixture of creme patissiere
and choux pastry.

400
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,280
None of it is actually
shining through

401
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,840
and it loses its personality.

402
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,040
Lemon tart.

403
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,640
You need to dress it up
a little bit, girls, come on!

404
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,160
It's half-done, for me.

405
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,680
Well, I got lemon

406
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,160
but you brought some tea into it.
Mm-hm.

407
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
It's very, very mild.

408
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,280
Well, as you can see, I did not
touch your pastry at all

409
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
because I think it's raw inside

410
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,960
and I have to refuse
to eat your pastry.

411
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
Boom.

412
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
Lemon tart, then. Lemon tart.

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,840
I don't mean to be discouraging

414
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,800
but I was hoping for a little bit
more from you two.

415
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,040
This is where the chefs
get creative!

416
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,360
But when I look at it, it's,
"Ah, it's only a tart."

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,240
I think you overcooked
your lemon filling.

418
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,040
Over here is very eggy.

419
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,560
And all the flavour profiles
you tried to work with

420
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
to enhance your lemon
tarts are not there.

421
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,240
OK, it's a little bit basic.

422
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
Yep.

423
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,640
What happened, chef?

424
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,280
We just ran out of a bit of time,
didn't we, really? I think, yeah.

425
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
By the looks of it,

426
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,480
you ran out of jam, as well,
didn't you?

427
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
Well, it's not cooked.

428
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,080
If it's not cooked,
it's not nice to eat

429
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,600
so let's hope the lemon tart
redeems itself.

430
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
OK.

431
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,400
Pastry, again.

432
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
You didn't cook it right.
It's just under-baked for me.

433
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
Is it interesting enough?

434
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,880
You should have pushed it
a little bit further.

435
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
Just disappointed
with myself, really.

436
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
Cos I know I'm better.

437
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,920
I mean, personally, I think, you
know, there's still all to play for.

438
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,480
For tomorrow's showpiece challenge,

439
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,040
the chefs have been given
a golden hour

440
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
to prepare any elements that need
setting overnight.

441
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,280
So no-one really, like,
smashed it the first day

442
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,160
but we can all agree that the Savoy
did better than the rest.

443
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
I think they're leading
at the moment.

444
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,560
But by a small margin because
everybody was pretty much

445
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,080
having a rough day.

446
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
And for the
girls from the WI?

447
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,120
I thought visually
their Pont Neuf

448
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,840
was the closest to
what it should look like.

449
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,000
Team R Chocolate?

450
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,800
You know, their lemon tart
was really cool.

451
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,400
Well, you see, it is potential.

452
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,680
What they produce
on the plate is potential.

453
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,360
And the duos, perhaps,
at the bottom,

454
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,440
where they're struggling a little
bit more, would be the Clink,

455
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,800
Graham's team from Silverstone.
Yeah.

456
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,040
And Leanne's team from Cafe Royal.

457
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,360
So looking forward to tomorrow,
the showpiece challenge.

458
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,200
Anything can happen tomorrow.

459
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
I would like the chef to unleash
their imagination.

460
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,360
When you open the door and you
walk in and it's so magical,

461
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,520
it's so wonderful, it's so sexy.

462
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,320
A sexy showpiece pastry. Yeah.

463
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,200
Good morning. Morning. Morning.

464
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,400
Good morning, chefs. I hope you had
a good night's sleep.

465
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
You are going to need
all your energy

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,560
for today's Showpiece Challenge.

467
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,200
It's all about taking the ordinary
and making it extraordinary.

468
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,360
You know, like, when Wetherspoon's
started serving breakfast.

469
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,080
Now, for this challenge, the judges
would like you to take inspiration

470
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,200
from a classic English dessert.

471
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,080
So, judges, can you tell us what
you've chosen for the teams?

472
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,600
Well, Tom, we have chosen Eton mess.

473
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,680
Of course, we want a modern twist
on that British classic.

474
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,320
Your dessert must feed
at least 24 people.

475
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,680
I would like you to be creative
with your flavour and texture.

476
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,560
Your design must
capture our eye with beauty.

477
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,680
Be warned, we will be watching you
at all times.

478
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,240
Thank you, Cherish, that was both
informative and terrifying

479
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
at the same time.

480
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,760
You had one hour last night to prep
and you have four hours remaining

481
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,640
to complete the challenge.

482
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,560
And your time starts...

483
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,760
..now.

484
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,360
Right. Let's go.

485
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
Let's do it.

486
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,440
As you're doing that, get your
meringue on, get that
straight in the oven.

487
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,440
Eton mess was first served at
the world-famous Eton College

488
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,760
in the 1800s,

489
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,000
and it's still served today at their
annual cricket match against Harrow.

490
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,880
The challenge with the Eton mess,
it's the most basic recipe,

491
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,960
the most basic dessert you can make.

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,640
Of course, this competition today
is not about being basic.

493
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,440
It's the opposite. We want drama, we
want skills, we want to be amazed.

494
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
"Wow!"

495
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,680
It is beautifully combined
cream, berry, and meringue,

496
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,160
but how does the chef put a stamp
onto this dessert

497
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,080
and make it their own?

498
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,680
It needs to be colourful.

499
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
It needs to be dynamic.

500
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,600
It needs to be magnificent.

501
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,400
The teams now have to create their
magnificent showpiece structures,

502
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,320
accompanied by Eton mess-inspired
desserts...

503
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,200
Quietly confident, but you never
know, anything can happen, really.

504
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,680
..which Eddie and Mahshid are hoping
to achieve by showcasing their

505
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,160
team captain's flair for sugar work.

506
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
What are you going to present
to us today?

507
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,920
Each dessert is going to have
its own sugar ball

508
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,640
and we're going to build the balls
around the Showpiece itself.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,160
So it's a filling going
inside the ball?

510
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,080
Yes. Oh, wow, how exciting. Wow.

511
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,320
Eddie's blown sugar spheres will
encase strawberry meringue,

512
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,720
strawberry coulis and
Chantilly cream,

513
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,960
sat beneath a towering structure
also made entirely of sugar.

514
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,080
Ed, this is your thing, isn't it,
doing sugar work?

515
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
Yeah, I love it.
What makes you love sugar so much?

516
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,240
It's so technical.

517
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,480
You know, it's beautiful.

518
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,920
But a sugar work showdown
is looming.

519
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
Desperate to improve after
yesterday,

520
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
Leanne and Romain are also
aiming to impress

521
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,000
with this notoriously
fickle technique.

522
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,440
So are you confident with sugar?
You've done a lot before?

523
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,760
I haven't done much.
It's a new skill, definitely.

524
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,520
Wow, it's very brave of you
to do sugar.

525
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,080
Would you be able to take us through

526
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
how you're going to
build your Showpiece?

527
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
To go back to the story
of the Eton mess.

528
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,080
You know they have a rowing team?
Yes.

529
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,800
And they are wearing, like,
big hats, lots of flowers on it.

530
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,800
Ah. So that's why we're
doing three rings

531
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,200
but a different technique
on each one.

532
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,560
Their sugar work centrepiece will
accompany two five-layer entremets

533
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,560
containing strawberry mousse, set
custard, jelly and strawberry glaze.

534
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,720
I don't want to say whether it's
going well or not

535
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,400
cos I might just jinx myself!

536
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,160
Don't want to speak too
fast today but

537
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,960
we believe to be on time
at the moment.

538
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,960
All the other teams have
shunned sugar

539
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
and are constructing with chocolate.

540
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,480
And after failing to
finish yesterday's miniatures,

541
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,600
for today's showpiece, Mustapha and
Kevin are going all-out.

542
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,120
Eton mess is reflected to cricket...

543
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
..so I'm making cricket bats

544
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,800
with some chocolate balls,

545
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
like a ball for cricket.

546
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,280
Alongside his bat and ball will sit
24 set strawberry mousses

547
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,840
containing cremeaux and confit
inserts

548
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,720
and a sponge base topped
off with meringue.

549
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,440
After yesterday,
how confident are you?

550
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,880
We're confident. Good.

551
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,040
This is what I want to hear.

552
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,360
We're confident but we've got really
good chefs in here

553
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
so we'll just try to focus again

554
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
and to avoid the mistakes
we did yesterday.

555
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,480
We'll get right and done on time.

556
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,240
So, I hope that Kevin, you're going
to run with Mustapha today?

557
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,080
Yep. I'm right behind him. Gear six.

558
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
Speeding. Formula 1.

559
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
That's it.

560
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,760
Also going full throttle for a
podium finish

561
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,360
after stalling on day one
are Graham and Dean.

562
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
Talk to us about the Eton mess.

563
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,800
We are designing 24
individual spheres

564
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,880
and we wanted a backdrop
to go with it

565
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,160
so we've designed the podium
from Silverstone.

566
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,080
Eton mess... Yes.

567
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,560
..on the racetrack.

568
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,160
Their raspberry-glazed
white chocolate spheres,

569
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
when smashed open,

570
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,760
should reveal
multicoloured meringues,

571
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,760
raspberry gel and mascarpone
clotted cream mousse.

572
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,080
Mascarpone cream and clotted cream.

573
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,080
Do you think so that me and Benoit
will enjoy eating it?

574
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,680
I think... I'm hoping you're
going to enjoy it.

575
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,000
Cos it's rich, delicious, loads of
flavours, loads of raspberries,

576
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,160
loads of fruit.
What it should be, really.

577
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,640
Yesterday, Kelly and Katie
won plaudits for their presentation

578
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,120
but today, that prospect seems
a little less likely.

579
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,600
So we've decided to still keep it
as a little bit of a mess,

580
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,120
so it's not called an Eton tidy,
so we've gone for a bit of a...

581
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,400
..well, it's like a
toadstool tea party.

582
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,600
At the base of a two-foot
chocolate toadstool,

583
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,160
there'll be chocolate teacups
containing meringue,

584
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,160
apple and vanilla jam and
Jerusalem artichoke panna cotta.

585
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,640
How come you've put Jerusalem
artichoke in that?

586
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,560
So, infamously, with the WI, it's
all renowned as jam and Jerusalem,

587
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,280
so we've made strawberry jam,
strawberry and apple jam. Uh-huh.

588
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,600
And we've got the Jerusalem
from the Jerusalem artichoke.

589
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,320
And there's a song, as well, isn't
there? It's Jerusalem the song.

590
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,560
Yeah. How does the song go?

591
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:50,040
THEY HUM JERUSALEM

592
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,400
THEY CRACK UP

593
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,080
I think I've go to stop!

594
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,600
Yeah, please do.
I'm getting a headache!

595
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,960
You're getting a headache?
From your singing!

596
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
Kidding!

597
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,800
Chocolate experts Slav and Maria are
taking their Eton mess

598
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
to explosive new heights.

599
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,400
I was born around mountains, OK,

600
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,400
so that gives me a
bit of inspiration.

601
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
We're going to make a volcano
with lava.

602
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Volcano! And all our mess will be
down, like rocks falling down. Ah!

603
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,320
Slav's pink and white meringue
lava rocks

604
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,600
filled with peach and raspberry
Chantilly cream

605
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,640
will sit around the
base of his chocolate volcanoes.

606
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,520
So this is going to be
the mountains

607
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,240
standing behind the Eton mess.

608
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,520
So I have five mountains already.
That is good.

609
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,280
Slav might be ahead of schedule

610
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,520
but the other teams still
have chocolate to temper and mould,

611
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,280
knowing they must leave enough time
for it to set.

612
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,720
So I am making the chocolate teacups

613
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,840
which is what we're going to
put our pudding into.

614
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,960
And now I'm just spreading
the chocolate around

615
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,280
so I'm about to give it a good
banging, as well.

616
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,520
As their chocolate sets,

617
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,240
the teams need to use every minute

618
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,400
to deliver the delicious fillings
the judges have demanded.

619
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
But, despite running
out of time yesterday,

620
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,880
Mustapha is risking another
multi-layered creation.

621
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,080
These are the inserts.

622
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,400
Mascarpone cream
and strawberry confit.

623
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,400
I'm going to put sponge in there
and finish with some fresh meringue.

624
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,320
This is going to be a
raspberry gel.

625
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,520
Put it back in the freezer
for a bit.

626
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,480
I think it's fine. I've just,
obviously, asked my assistant, er,

627
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,600
what he thought, cos I'm thinking
maybe another sheet of gelatine but

628
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,280
I think that might be fine.
You don't want it too gelatinous.

629
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,280
With gelatine in every element of
Leanne's four entremets,

630
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,440
ensuring the amount she uses doesn't
ruin the dessert's texture

631
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,760
is four times as hard.

632
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
So I've made all the components.

633
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,400
Just building it up
when each layer sets.

634
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,160
Chefs, you are halfway through.

635
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,920
The teams working with chocolate

636
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,640
now face the delicate task
of demoulding.

637
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,080
I like kind of tried to practise
these spheres, every time I could.

638
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,000
They are really hard to get out.

639
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
We'll try our best.

640
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,520
And Kelly's cups and saucers
aren't proving any easier.

641
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,600
A breakage!

642
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
BANGING ON TABLE

643
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
BLEEP

644
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
All right.

645
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,600
Damn.

646
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
BLEEP

647
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,560
I'm having a nightmare.

648
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,560
What the hell are we going to do
about this bloody...

649
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
BLEEP

650
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,440
Our teacups they are...
predominantly breaking

651
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,640
so we might have to change it to
broken china.

652
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,040
Do you want me to break
this last one?

653
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,560
Yeah. Really?

654
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,880
Working with chocolate
might be risky...

655
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,600
Relief. That's good, it's better
that it comes in practice.

656
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,040
But rivals in sugar work,

657
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,920
Eddie and Roman are about to take
on one of the hardest techniques

658
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,000
in patisserie.

659
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,800
Right now, I'm doing all my sugars.

660
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,320
We're going to start to pull it
to give it the right colour.

661
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,800
It's very technical.

662
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,920
Not easy to do.

663
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,800
Sugar melts and becomes pliable
at 170 degrees.

664
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
It won't stick. It's too cold.

665
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,600
It must then be manipulated
very quickly,

666
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,360
using heat lumps and blowtorches
to maintain the high temperature.

667
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,120
Bring the blowtorch quick.
Quick, quick, quick, quick!

668
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,680
If it's allowed to cool even
a few degrees,

669
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,400
the sugar can become brittle
in a matter of seconds.

670
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,200
It's not working. Not working.
It's not working.

671
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,960
Because it's locked.
Give me, give me, give me.

672
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,880
We'll just keep it like that,
for decoration.

673
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,680
Don't worry, don't worry,
it's BLEEP.

674
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,400
It's not working.

675
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,080
Chefs! You have half-an-hour left!

676
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,880
The teams now face the painstaking
task of assembling their desserts.

677
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,360
This is a horrible idea.

678
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,600
Yeah, BLEEP. This is stupid.

679
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,680
Don't break, don't break,
don't break...

680
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,560
Oh, you BLEEP.

681
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,000
Far too hot.

682
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,360
Starting to get the assembly
going now.

683
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,560
Just need to get the podiums
in place.

684
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,960
This is where it all
starts to fit nicely.

685
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,440
BLEEP!

686
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,040
Come on. Let's go, yeah?
Yeah, let's go.

687
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,640
Which way you going?
It isn't the right way.

688
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,360
Guys, you actually have 15 minutes
left.

689
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
That's, like, serious.
Just saying...

690
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,480
OK. You can quit there.

691
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,960
Looks like a mushroom.

692
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,200
Happy? Not yet, I want to check in
there.

693
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,480
I put this one and I put it
on the table.

694
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,920
That's it. Put it on the table now.
Put it on the table now.

695
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,720
Safe? Yes.

696
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,720
Go, both now. We're going.

697
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,960
You go first. Lovely.

698
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
Yes? Yeah, you go first.

699
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,800
Both, both look.

700
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,960
Go, go, go, go, go!

701
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,640
Touch and push a little bit, please.

702
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
Yes.

703
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
It's got to face that way.

704
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
BLEEP!

705
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,040
We are not stressed.

706
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,160
We are almost there.
We are finished.

707
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,480
We just need to finish
the last touches.

708
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,160
There's not much we can do,
but, there's something.

709
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,400
We'll present.

710
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,560
Are you happy with that?

711
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,920
I'm chuffed with it. Hey,
we've done what being a chef is.

712
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,160
Thinking on your feet.

713
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,280
You're a chef and you're
a teacher, don't be defeatist.

714
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,600
Things happen.

715
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,040
CLATTERING
Oh, BLEEP!

716
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,600
Sorry, Dean. That's it, mate.

717
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,520
I've lost them, mate.

718
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,800
No, I've just dropped ten.

719
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,200
Chefs! One minute left!
One minute left!

720
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,520
What happened to me?

721
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,360
Come on, stick them on,
stick them on!

722
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,360
Such a good feeling
that we didn't have to rush.

723
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,240
No, don't let me down, please.

724
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,080
Well done, Dean.

725
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,680
Chefs! Your time is up!

726
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,400
Oh, my God, I feel so bad!

727
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
Stand behind your counters.

728
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,920
HE KISSES HIM

729
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,840
Six elaborate Eton mess show pieces

730
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
made in just five hours.

731
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,280
I know.

732
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,080
Looking at as whole,
I really like the concept.

733
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,960
What really intrigued me,
you break the teacup.

734
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,920
Would I like
it as a whole teacup?

735
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,600
I don't think so. But when you break
it up, I said, "Oh, my goodness,

736
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
"how amazing is this?!"

737
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,600
Whew.

738
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,360
It kind of worked, huh?

739
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
What do you think?

740
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,800
Well, I think you adapted, so that
is great.

741
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,280
OK? So, here we go.

742
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,880
I like that. Oh-ho-ho!

743
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,480
I think flavour-wise, it has worked.

744
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,040
The Jerusalem artichoke,

745
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,080
I'm not too sure. It's a little bit
grainy for me.

746
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,040
Looking at the showpiece, I think
you did a very good job.

747
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,800
However, it's very safe.

748
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,360
Have you done enough for this
competition?

749
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,080
In terms of skill set,
there is no elegance,

750
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,520
there is no finesse.

751
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
Boring, boring, boring.

752
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,440
It's just cream and meringue.

753
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,520
I really enjoyed the part of
creating a clear bowl,

754
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,320
perfectly blown, very difficult.

755
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,520
On the general elegance of your
presentation,

756
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,720
it's a little bit chunky.

757
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
I would love to see a little bit of
the pulled sugar element.

758
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,360
OK. We need to taste the dessert.

759
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,280
Concept is amazing!

760
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,280
But when I taste this,
I'm disappointed.

761
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,800
There's only three element.

762
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,880
You have your meringue, you have
your chantilly,

763
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,480
and you have your coulis.

764
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,720
It take no effort
just to do three element.

765
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,560
I can see that you've used three
different sugar technique.

766
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
There is the beautiful purple and
white ribbon.

767
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,920
I think you are showing to us that
you've got potential.

768
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,560
You've created a design made of lots
of skills.

769
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,720
It's elegant. Yeah, I think you
achieved so much more today,

770
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
compared to yesterday.

771
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,800
It's just too much gelatin in your
cake. I can't eat it at all.

772
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,160
I think we're going to have to
accept the fact that you've done a

773
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,840
great effort on your presentation

774
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,520
and brought a lot of skills to the
table,

775
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,680
but the dessert, perhaps, half done.

776
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,440
I think the amount of work put into
the design

777
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,800
of the showpiece during the
competition is pretty basic.

778
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,360
Not to say, perhaps, non-existent.

779
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,240
I think it's lack of excitement.

780
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,440
Pretty basic. Pretty basic.

781
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
OK.

782
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,600
HARD TAPPING

783
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,520
Somebody here?
THEY GIGGLE

784
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,120
Really like the nice touch of
meringue.

785
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,800
However, I think it's very fatty on
my palate.

786
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,040
Personally, I find it all far too
sweet.

787
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,040
The cricket bat, I could have seen
perhaps a little bit more

788
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,240
white sugar had been used,

789
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,560
which would have made it stand out a
little bit more.

790
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,960
It's all a bit too much one colour.

791
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,440
As a whole, I think it's a little
bit untidy.

792
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
Mm. You did not glaze the cake
completely.

793
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
Yeah.

794
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,280
Where is the sponge? You have an
element sponge, haven't you?

795
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,120
We didn't put it in there.

796
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
What a shame. So, what happened to
the meringue?

797
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,640
Er...we just...we left it
in the oven.

798
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,480
It's missing the meringue,
it's missing texture,

799
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,120
though, the flavour, actually,
quite nice.

800
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,680
Chefs, thank you. Excellent.
Thank you.

801
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,320
HE SIGHS

802
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
I'll take the blame. No, of course
not.

803
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,760
Oh, definitely.

804
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,840
Benoit and Cherish will now rank the
teams' performances across both
challenges.

805
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,320
The team in last place
will have to leave the competition.

806
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,240
Well, we had a plan.

807
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,800
It didn't work exactly what we
expect.

808
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,000
The flavour was good, but they
forgotten two element in their dish.

809
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,360
Graham and Dean, they've made quite
a few mistakes.

810
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,960
I think I just lost the edge,
really. I just lost...

811
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,880
I don't know.
Eh, it's all right, buddy.

812
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,840
Yeah. You know, just one of those...
Anything, ever, we're a team,
as always.

813
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,360
Benoit and Cherish have made their
decision.

814
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:23,960
The team in first place showed the
corps patisserie skills

815
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:27,360
and the ability
to adapt and to deliver.

816
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,400
Congratulations,

817
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,240
Eddie and Mahshid from The Savoy.

818
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,760
THEY GASP

819
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,560
Yes! Thank you. Thank you.

820
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:38,960
The judges awarded second place to
Kelly and Katie,

821
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,360
third to Slav and Maria,

822
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,080
and joining them in the next round,

823
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:44,880
Leanne and Romain, in fourth place.

824
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:53,240
Which leaves Graham and Dean from
Silverstone,

825
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,320
and Mustapha and Kevin from
The Clink.

826
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,680
After much deliberation,
Benoit and Cherish have decided

827
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,400
that the team going home tonight
are...

828
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,280
..Mustapha and Kevin.

829
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,400
Congratulations to the rest of you.

830
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,480
We'll see you next week.

831
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:20,640
MURMURED CONVERSATION

832
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,280
Well done.

833
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,720
Well done. Sorry to see you go.

834
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,120
Oh, well.

835
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:29,520
I'm gutted to be going out. Course I
am. But, I mean, to be fair,

836
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,760
I think they all deserved to stay
there.

837
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,840
We're not ready for it at the
moment. We try to practise as much

838
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:37,200
as we can together,
and we come back next year.

839
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,240
Sorry. No worries.

840
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,080
Dean, well done.

841
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:47,160
Uh, I think we're very
extremely, extremely lucky!

842
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,360
Disbelief. I'm amazed, really. Yeah.

843
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,720
Thank you, Chef. Congratulations.
Thank you. Give me a hug.

844
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,240
A proper hug.

845
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,600
We came first on this challenge.
We want to stay up there,

846
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,360
but we don't know what the other
teams are going to pull out the bag

847
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,320
next week, so it's all to
play for, still.

848
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,160
Congratulations! Well done!

849
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,560
The pressure is...is off.
You know, we can finally relax.

850
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:11,600
It's not off! It's not off, but just
for tonight, it's off!

851
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:14,280
Next time, the five remaining
teams...

852
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:16,840
How's it going?!
I'm having a disaster.

853
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:19,760
..take on a multitude of
multi-layered miniatures...

854
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,080
It's coming apart, mate. BLEEP.

855
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:23,960
..and a divine Choux bun showpiece.

856
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,800
She finishes the first, like,
chocolate Bible, ever.

857
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,200
But who will fall from grace?

858
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,800
I think, er, car crash.

859
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,480

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Welcome to Week Five of Bake Off:
The Professionals.

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,320
If you're in any doubt about how
brutal this show is,

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:11,120
this is what happens to substandard
patisserie.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,120
BOTH: Pull!

5
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,600
GUN FIRES

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,920
Do you think maybe that was a bit
harsh, Tom?

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,440
Do you think you're a bit soft,
Liam?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,160
Last time, we met six brand-new
teams...

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,200
Go, go, go, go, go!

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:32,640
Eddie and Mashid from the Savoy
dazzled with their creativity...

11
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,160
This is what we are looking for.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,640
Beautiful. Well done.
..and took first place.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,680
Yes!

14
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:39,680
The boys from Silverstone, Graham
and Dean,

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,240
struggled to get into gear...

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,920
Might as well just throw it in
the bin.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
..but Mustafa and Kevin from The
Clink lacked the finishing touch.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,360
So, what happened to the meringue?
We left it in the oven.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,320
I'm gutted to be going out, but to
be fair,

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,960
I think they all deserve to stay
there.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,720
This week... They are not fine,
they're squashed!

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,080
..they'll have to master
multi-layered miniatures...

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,960
Not too much risk. ..that leave
nowhere to hide.

24
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,680
And reinvent a spiritual choux...

25
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,080
Do you think this is the first,
like, chocolate Bible ever?

26
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:08,000
..fit for the pastry gods.

27
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,720
And then we have an exhaust that
comes out the top.

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560
But whose prayers will be
answered...

29
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:15,360
..and who will fall from grace?

30
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,880
# Every little thing

31
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,600
# Are going to be all right. #

32
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,080
There are five remaining teams in
this heat of the competition.

33
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,200
After tomorrow, there will be just
four.

34
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:39,040
Chefs, today is all about layered
slices.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,120
Well, isn't every day?

36
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,560
The judges are asking for two types,
24 of each.

37
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,840
So, Benoit, what have you chosen for
the first layered slice?

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,240
I have chosen a French classic
called an opera.

39
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,440
I want to see layers of joconde
sponge, ganache, coffee buttercream,

40
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,360
and each slice must have the word
"opera" inscribed on it.

41
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,920
I have chosen roulade flavoured with
exotic fruit.

42
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:11,880
In each roulade slice, we would like
to see a minimum of two fillings.

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,520
And each one must be identical.

44
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,440
I will be checking.

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,960
You have three and a half hours.

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,520
Your time starts now.

47
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,600
We are testing with the layered
slice

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,880
because there is nowhere to hide.

49
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,640
Everything will be visible and every
mistake will be obvious.

50
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,280
We have asked the chefs to make the
roulade with exotic fruit.

51
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,560
We do not expect anything that is
boring.

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,160
First, you need to make your sponge.

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,760
The most crucial thing is to bake
the sponge to perfection.

54
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,920
Then make a jelly,

55
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,800
and put this thinly on the sponge.

56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,000
Follow the jelly with a beautiful
mousseline, carefully roll it up,

57
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,480
spray them with a light glaze.

58
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,120
What I want to see is for the chef
to push the boundary

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,840
to show us something magical.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,480
Morning, the WI team.

61
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,560
Tell us your roulade, please.

62
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,560
So, I'm making a Japanese matcha
roulade.

63
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,000
Ah, matcha roulade!

64
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,040
What does matcha actually taste
like? It's like green tea.

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,200
My favourite.

66
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,840
Oh, lovely!

67
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,840
Kelly's passion for baking started a
bit closer to home

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,120
in her mum's kitchen.

69
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,760
There's loads of photos of me stood
on a chair

70
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,360
with hands in the bowl.

71
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,640
THEY LAUGH

72
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:37,240
Her matcha-flavoured sponge will
roll around lychee jelly

73
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
and another Far Eastern-inspired
filling.

74
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,440
We're doing a custard apple
creme pat.

75
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,560
Which I grew up with as well.

76
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,080
Right outside my house, we have
custard apple.

77
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,200
Custard apple? It's quite
intriguing.

78
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,640
It's very milky in flavour.

79
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,760
It's very fruity. Absolutely love
it.

80
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,680
Mmm. Tastes like custard.

81
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,720
THEY LAUGH

82
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,040
Mmm.

83
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,000
While Kelly and Katie head east,

84
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,320
R Chocolates' Maria and Slav are
heading for the West Indies.

85
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,080
I'm making my mango and passion
fruit mousse.

86
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,600
Passion fruit is my favourite fruit,
I would say.

87
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,640
It lifts me up, it gives me passion.

88
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,320
I don't go anywhere in life without
passion and love.

89
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,400
Good afternoon. Welcome to my home
in London.

90
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,160
Slav travelled from Macedonia to
London 12 years ago,

91
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,480
determined to learn all he could
about patisserie.

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
He now has two degrees on the
subject.

93
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,720
So, you're extremely well qualified?

94
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,480
Yes, indeed. I would say. I have so
many hats.

95
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,000
Now he's travelling to the Caribbean
for a roulade with passion fruit

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,880
and mango mousse, lime jelly and a
coconut joconde sponge.

97
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,600
All this is tropical - lying down on
the beach, relax, eat, drink.

98
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,280
Bob Marley.

99
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,040
Graham and Dean have been inspired
by more than one Jamaican hero -

100
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,560
the island's 1988 Winter Olympic
bobsleigh team.

101
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,720
I've based my roulade on Cool
Runnings.

102
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,080
It's one of my favourite films.
HE LAUGHS

103
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,600
Jamaican feel, it might be too
colourful for the judges,

104
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,680
but we'll see.

105
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,600
Sporting competition are at the
heart of everything Silverstone
team-mates

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,880
Graham and Dean do, including their
family get-togethers.

107
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,920
They're aiming for a winning spiral
of pink sponge,

108
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,120
layered with coconut and rum
panna cotta,

109
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,840
wrapped around a passion fruit
cheesecake cylinder.

110
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,840
And their Cool Runnings roulade will
be wrapped in a chilled pineapple

111
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,520
carpaccio, soaked in a lime and
chilli syrup.

112
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,560
We've brought a beastie of a slicing
machine today.

113
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,920
And I like pineapple, so it's got to
go in there.

114
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,720
For this first challenge, the
tropical bug seems to be catching.

115
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,320
We decided to go with mango.

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,920
Then mango can be...

117
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,320
I find it quite flat. I like to have
some acidity,

118
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,280
so we just went full-on with lime
on it.

119
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,200
It's good. But we will see.

120
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,480
I'm not the judge, so...

121
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,280
Romain began his patisserie career
in France at just 15 years old.

122
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,400
At only 21,

123
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,480
his raw talent was spotted by the
world-famous Hotel Cafe Royal

124
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,960
and he is now their youngest ever
head baker.

125
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,760
Romain and Leanne's roulade will
have a bruleed lime meringue coating

126
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,480
which will hide mango mousse and
lime and mango jelly.

127
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,640
And in a bid to ensure that
all-important neat spiral...

128
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm now going to put them on the
trays.

129
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,080
For flexibility, Romain has chosen
to make a classic Swiss roll sponge.

130
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,440
Follow the recipe, smile and hope.

131
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,880
What else can I say?

132
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,440
Whichever recipe they've chosen...

133
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,480
Genoese is a fatless sponge, nice
and light.

134
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,080
It's easy to manipulate.

135
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,840
..the sponge for a roulade is
patisserie's most fickle mistress.

136
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,640
We've got the Japanese sponge and
we've just infused that

137
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,320
with some matcha green tea.
Preheated oven, 180 degrees.

138
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,680
Just a fraction under-baked,

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
and its texture won't contrast with
the exotic fruit fillings.

140
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
The consistency looks all right.

141
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,440
A fraction over and it will be
impossible to roll.

142
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,240
# Don't worry, I'll be there...
All right!

143
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,320
# Every little thing are
going to be all right. #

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,120
We hope you are going to sing this
at the end of the show as well!

145
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
But the Savoy's Eddie and Mashid
have given themselves

146
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,080
even more to worry about. How are
you going to roll it up?

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
We spread it and then we cut each
slice individually,

148
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,920
and then we roll them like that,
just so we can ensure

149
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
that each piece is perfectly rolled.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
Each one has to be identical.

151
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,560
It will be, chef. Looks like you are
very confident.

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
There's no panic.

153
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,680
Iranian-born Mashid's confidence saw
her give up a 13-year career

154
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,240
at the Foreign Office to pursue her
passion for pastry.

155
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,560
Just four years later,

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,680
she's perfecting desserts for
London's 5-star Savoy.

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
I wish I had done it sooner, to be
quite honest.

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
I love it so much.

159
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,040
Her glazed roulades will feature
mango confit,

160
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,760
coconut white chocolate ganache

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
and passion fruit syrup,

162
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,160
which she'll use to soak her strips
of fatless Viennese sponge.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,520
Roulade sponges are so thin they
bake in only a few minutes.

164
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,520
BLEEP! BLEEP...

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
The margin for error is tiny.

166
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,640
Quick, quick, quick. Just 30 seconds
could destroy the team's

167
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,640
prospects in this first challenge.

168
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,760
Beautiful. Oh, the smell is
really nice!

169
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
I'm very happy for the look.

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,360
How long was it? Eight minutes.

171
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,160
Yeah. If you leave it on the tray
too long,

172
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,320
then it will crisp up and then you
can't roll it.

173
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
I'm going to place the cloths on
top.

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,360
It will maintain them soft until I
roll them up.

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
I think they look great. Nice,
vibrant colour.

176
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,960
Colour is the least of Kelly and
Katie's worries.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
I'm having a disaster.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Tell me all about it.

179
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,320
Is it in your personal life or is it
with the cakes?

180
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,680
I'm good for both.
SHE LAUGHS

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,040
It is the cake.

182
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,760
My sponge is a little bit dense and
therefore didn't cook properly,

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,160
so I'm absolutely gutted, but I
don't have time to remake,

184
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,680
but I've just got to go with it.

185
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,480
I mean, it's not like they ever
notice things like that. Never!

186
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
SHE LAUGHS

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,040
So, fingers crossed.

188
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,040
Chefs, you are halfway through.

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,280
This layered miniature challenge is
about to get much harder.

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,400
The teams still have to deliver
Benoit's opera slice.

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
A lot can go wrong with an opera.

192
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,560
The gateau's immaculately neat
layers

193
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,520
are said to resemble the grand tiers

194
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,640
inside the stunning Paris opera
house.

195
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,280
I have picked this challenge
because, first, I like it.

196
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,520
It's just a treat to eat.

197
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,000
Technically, it shows your master
skills of layering.

198
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,840
You start with the sponge, it has to
be joconde.

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,240
The key with the joconde is the
almond element.

200
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,920
So, you need to have a perfect even
spread of the mixture,

201
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,000
and then baked perfectly before it
gets soaked with very strong coffee.

202
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,680
Buttercream, more joconde...

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,360
..and the ganache comes in -
elegant, silk,

204
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,440
another joconde, more buttercream,
you glaze, you cut,

205
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,680
and finish with the word "opera"
neatly inscribed on every slice.

206
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,960
Benoit is expecting a totally
faithful recreation of this classic.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,520
But as well as a risky plan for
rolling their roulade...

208
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,480
Cut them all now before it sets.
Don't worry about putting it on the
tray.

209
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
I have to put it on the tray.

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,240
But then you can put it back in the
freezer after, can't you? No...

211
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
Yes, you can. No. Yes.

212
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
Eddie and Mashid are taking another
gamble with the opera's

213
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
hallmark joconde sponge.

214
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
So, we're going to do a
gluten-free joconde.

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,960
OK. We feel that it gives us a
little more texture to work with,

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,960
a little more of a... Elasticity,
flexibility?

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,880
Yeah, more or less. OK. That's
interesting.

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,880
We can e-mail you the recipe. OK!

219
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,240
And the writing, what colour are you
going to write the opera word on?

220
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,520
Dark chocolate. Dark chocolate!

221
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
As it should be.

222
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
I thought it was white chocolate?

223
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
You think wrong.

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,000
While the Savoy go gluten-free...

225
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,920
This bowl is maybe a bit too small.

226
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,480
..over at the Hotel Cafe Royal,

227
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,720
they have accidentally cut out a
crucial opera component.

228
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,520
We didn't read the brief properly.

229
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,600
The judges will be expecting a
joconde sponge, where it's more
almond-y,

230
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
and the sponge we've got is more
spongy.

231
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,320
We don't have any time to make
another one.

232
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
It's making me really nervous what
they're going to say.

233
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,080
I'm sorry for French people, if they
are looking at me again.

234
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,160
People... People may just want to
kill me now!

235
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,000
This is just one of the layers in
the opera.

236
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,200
I've got to make them even.

237
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,720
If it's not even all the way round,

238
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,000
half of it will turn out like a
biscuit and then we're going to be
deep in it.

239
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
Ready to go in.

240
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,360
The baking time for an opera sponge
will directly affect how neatly

241
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
the finished cake can be sliced.

242
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,640
If over-baked and tough, during
cutting

243
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,640
the fillings will be forced to
ooze out.

244
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
If under-baked, once soaked with the
coffee syrup,

245
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,560
the layers will disintegrate.

246
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,960
We're using an espresso, so it is
very intense.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,520
That's the idea with the opera cake
is that as you eat it,

248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
it should be like coffee.

249
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,840
Despite bringing his love of fresh
pineapple to his roulade,

250
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,600
when it comes to Graham's opera, his
coffee is far from fresh.

251
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,920
We're using a Camp Coffee.

252
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,520
It's coffee essence with chicory
in it.

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
We use the Camp Coffee because I
kind of like it.

254
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,920
But we'll have an espresso, if
you're making.

255
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,400
Already struggling to pull off an
ambitious Japanese roulade...

256
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Not too much risk.

257
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,840
..the WI cookery school's source of
coffee flavour is a little more

258
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,400
down-to-earth. We're using instant
coffee.

259
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
Not everybody has espresso machines,

260
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,400
so I prefer instant coffee because
it's easily accessible.

261
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,920
Looking good. Looking good.

262
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,280
With time short, the moment their
opera slices are cool,

263
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,840
the teams need to start soaking and
layering.

264
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,520
Joconde, buttercream,

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,360
joconde, ganache,

266
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
joconde, buttercream, joconde.

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,080
No... Forget the last thing I said.

268
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,760
Joconde sponge is very dry and it
can absorb a lot of moisture,

269
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,600
so I am always telling to Maria,
"Make it like a Lake District."

270
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
Lake District!

271
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,520
Just want to make sure it's
well-soaked everywhere.

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
This is the coffee buttercream.
Making sure it's nice and even.

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,760
They need to be all the same, all
perfect.

274
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,680
But in pursuit of perfect layers,

275
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
Eddie and Mashid are taking yet
another complicated route.

276
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,720
We're going to start building ours
upside down.

277
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,400
How long we got left? Chefs,
you have 30 minutes.

278
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,920
Liam, something's not right.

279
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,720
Thank you. Chefs, you have 30
minutes left!

280
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,400
You've got 30 minutes.

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
That's much better.

282
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,880
Going to start rolling the sponge.

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
It's going to hopefully hold itself
well.

284
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
I'm going to roll each one
individually.

285
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,160
It shows a different skill.

286
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,800
I didn't want to be like everyone
else.

287
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
It should be OK.

288
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
I just need to squeeze now to have
good layers, and even.

289
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
Just get these rolls first, mate.

290
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,440
Hang on. It's coming apart, mate.

291
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
Oh, for BLEEP sake!

292
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,960
Don't crack. Don't crack.
Don't crack.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,880
We are going to get on the pineapple
with it rolled up tight.

294
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
Hopefully, it will hold its shape.

295
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,040
I am doing the dark glaze for the
opera.

296
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,120
Are going to glaze that now, Eddie?

297
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,240
No, it's already glazed. We built
ours upside down.

298
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
You built it upside down, like a
tarte tatin of opera!

299
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,680
What you going to put underneath?
We're going to put, like, chocolate.

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
It's called a chablon. Un chablon!

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,360
Sorry, I'm just going to run away
from you for a second.

302
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
It's what happens every time I talk
to a man - they run off.

303
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,920
I'm applying some gold powder, make
it more elegant.

304
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,720
Cutting it can be very crucial.

305
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,680
I hope we're going to have
enough time.

306
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,440
The only thing that I'm really
worried about is the layers,

307
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,880
having them all identical. This is
that moment.

308
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
Literally holding my breath.

309
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,120
Opera's coming out really well.

310
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
Looks very good. Very even.

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,920
Glaze is runny as BLEEP.

312
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,160
Writing, writing, write...

313
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Bit stressed.

314
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,640
I'm just making the chocolate leaves
to decorate the roulade.

315
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,600
It's just coming out.

316
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,360
Cos it's so warm in here, my panna
cotta's started to melt.

317
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,440
So, it's not quite worked out today.

318
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
The room is so hot, it's, like,
melting all the cream.

319
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,160
It's fine, Mashid, just put them in
the freezer.

320
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,280
Five minutes, chefs.

321
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,680
Time flies when you're having fun.

322
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,680
And when you're not.

323
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,560
Just got a bit of the shakes at the
moment...

324
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,080
Just trying to do it as quick as
I can.

325
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,720
It's fallen! BLEEP!

326
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,440
It fell down? BLEEP!

327
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,440
No, look, it's OK. It's not OK!
Mashid, Mashid, calm down.

328
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
Eddie's dropped a tray on a batch of
Mashid's roulades.

329
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
Calm down, Rashid. It's OK.

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
Look. They're fine.

331
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
They are not fine.

332
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
They are squashed.

333
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,320
It's not set at all.

334
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah, just melting in my hands.

335
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,040
I might have to leave them.

336
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,800
You sure you don't want to try
and spray?

337
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,400
At least spray a couple. I'm not
going to spray them.

338
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
Don't have to.

339
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,440
We've got this, Mashid. We've
got this.

340
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,760
Bit stressed.

341
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Where we up to, mate?

342
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
Nine to go.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,240
You have one minute left.

344
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,000
Just power through and put the
sugar on.

345
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
Get the sugar on.

346
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
It's absolutely fine.

347
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
Finished! Yes!

348
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
Absolutely.

349
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,960
Time is up.

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
Step away from your slices.

351
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
BLEEP nailed it.

352
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,120
My first ones were perfect and you
squashed them.

353
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,720
Sabotage. Sabotaged by my own
team member!

354
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,840
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was
going to do that.

355
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,720
It's judgment time for the layered
miniatures.

356
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,480
SHE SIGHS AND HUMS

357
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,000
The Savoy, please come forward.

358
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,200
They look pretty even and really
close to what I would have hoped an

359
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,920
opera to look like. When I lift up
your cake,

360
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,680
you actually put a layer of
chocolate right on the bottom.

361
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,480
It's very professional to do that
as well.

362
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
OK.

363
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Mm.

364
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,760
Flourless sponge.

365
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,680
Yes. Well-soaked.

366
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,760
And I really enjoyed the balance
between your buttercream and your

367
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,240
ganache. I've got all the flavour of
the opera.

368
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
If you would have actually nailed
the writing,

369
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,280
you would have had a very nice
slice. Well done.

370
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,200
Looking at the roulade, I was hoping
that there's more finesse.

371
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,040
Mm-hm. Where's the glaze? We had a
slight issue when we were taking out

372
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,280
the sponges for the roulade.

373
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
The glaze was ready but it was just,
we ran out of time.

374
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,240
Running out of time as well. It was
either the glaze or the decoration.

375
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,920
I decided to go with the decoration.

376
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,200
Oh, that's a shame. Yeah, it's
a shame.

377
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,440
I quite like the layering that you
put through.

378
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
I think it's very neatly done.

379
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,960
And it's so precise and, most of
all, I really enjoyed eating it.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
The balance was just right.

381
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,520
It tastes sensational to me.

382
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,080
Well done. Thank you. The flavour
profile, very clean, very neat.

383
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,400
You've got the coconut, you've got
mangoes and all that.

384
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,880
Texture-wise, I would have wished
that the sponge was a dacquoise.

385
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
I would not change it.

386
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,040
I would not change it in any form.

387
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
We're going to agree to disagree,
huh? That is beautiful.

388
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,680
It's a-mazing.

389
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,160
A-mazing.

390
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,840
It may look a little bit like an
opera, but that almondy,

391
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,280
slightly chewy, rich sponge is
not there.

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,360
Looking at the roulade, they look
quite uniform.

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,240
What happened to your chocolate
leaves?

394
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
They were not perfect and we didn't
want to put them on.

395
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,680
OK. It looks very simple.

396
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,600
The sponge is very elastic.

397
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,840
It's very dry.

398
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600
I would expect more from a
professional chef.

399
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,880
Visually, the opera has very thin
layers.

400
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,120
Everything is neatly cut and it's
finished also with white chocolate,

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,760
but you've put a little bit of gold
powder on it.

402
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,840
You've brought a little twist.

403
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
A little too much chocolate.

404
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
Makes it a little bit sweet.

405
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
But I've got a coffee aftertaste,
and the sponge is well-soaked.

406
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,880
Looking at the roulade, it's quite
heavy-handed, and the swirl as well,

407
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,560
it is very untidy.

408
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
Some parts of it, the taste is nice,

409
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,880
the zesty, citrus, exotic taste
to it.

410
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,520
However, the proportion of the
filling to the sponge is not right.

411
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,760
But I like the idea of coconut in
your sponge. Thank you.

412
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
Chefs, what happened?

413
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Look as though they're crying
for help.

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
"Help!" Just got so warm in this
kitchen.

415
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
I would say you guys chose the wrong
recipes, full stop.

416
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,080
The other teams have had the same
kitchen.

417
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,560
It's a shame, because I like the
idea of the pink sponge.

418
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
The texture is so unpleasant.

419
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,360
It's not as bad as it looks.

420
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,280
The chilli, I got, and it's not
overpowering.

421
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,000
You used your lemon grass, you used
lime, you used coconut,

422
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,800
and then you've got your passion
as well.

423
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
You are trying to put everything in,

424
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
hoping that some things might be
happy with each other.

425
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,320
Your opera slice actually look quite
nice in terms of the layering.

426
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,680
Let's taste.

427
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,720
You used Camp coffee?

428
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,840
Mm-hm. My mother used chicory to add
into her coffee.

429
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,200
It's a great addition, but, agh,
I haven't got enough coffee.

430
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,160
It needs to be coffee somewhere.

431
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
Er...

432
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,240
I'm far from the opera I'm looking
for, guys. I'm sorry.

433
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,840
Well, we've got an attempt at
layering.

434
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,040
These ones look pretty even.

435
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,840
Not the case for every single one
of them.

436
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
This about 3.2.

437
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,040
This is about 3.8.

438
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,200
About five millimetres.

439
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,200
Yeah, so it's quite inconsistent.

440
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
I've got the coffee and chocolate.

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,520
Is it fragrant enough?

442
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,760
No. I would love a little bit more
roasting kind of coffee,

443
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
and your sponge is slightly dry.

444
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,560
Looking at the roulade, it can be
more precise and I can see that

445
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,360
actually your cream, it just weighs
down your slice.

446
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,040
It's not the most appealing roulade
slice I've ever seen,

447
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,320
and I'll leave it there.

448
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
The sponge is very heavy.

449
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,480
It's not cooked. I was trying to
taste the custard apple.

450
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,600
Somehow, it's just lost inside.

451
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,520
I will not run to buy one of
those slices.

452
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,440
On a scale of terrible to really
terrible?

453
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,040
Terrible. Terrible.

454
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,920
I feel like I've let people down,
and it's just disappointing for me,

455
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,240
really. You haven't let me down.

456
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,400
I still love you.

457
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
After a gruelling first day,

458
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,680
the teams now have a golden hour to
prepare for an even more daunting

459
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,840
challenge - tomorrow's showpiece.

460
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
In terms of who's leading, it is
the Savoy team.

461
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,560
And you can see that Eddie really
pushes himself.

462
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,960
Yeah, he is very competitive.

463
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,920
R Chocolate, they seem to work
very efficiently.

464
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
They work very, very clean and they
organise themselves.

465
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
They even had time to clean
the kitchen.

466
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,760
Exactly. Very handy.
I mean, impressive.

467
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,240
I wish I could do that. I'm really
worried about Cafe Royale.

468
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,200
They can't even make a sponge.

469
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
But this is the common
youngster mistake.

470
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,960
Yeah. They didn't read the brief!

471
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,640
I see two or three teams struggling.

472
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,280
Our lovely colleagues from
Silverstone, the WI.

473
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,840
I think they lost control of their
ambition.

474
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,240
I've got faith. I think they're
going to smash it tomorrow.

475
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,360
Let's not underestimate that this is
a challenge which is not easy.

476
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,720
Oh, no, Benoit.

477
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
No-one was thinking they're going
to just be able to have a walk in

478
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
the park tomorrow.

479
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,200
One challenge remains before one of
these five teams will have to leave

480
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
the competition.
Good morning, chefs.

481
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,640
It's time for your second showpiece
challenge of the competition.

482
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,120
Today, we'd like you to prepare an
occasion showpiece.

483
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,920
How often would one make one
of these?

484
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,080
Just occasionally. I see.

485
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,200
It is inspired by the French classic
the religieuse,

486
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,640
which consists of two choux buns
filled with creme patissiere and

487
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,480
topped with a sugar glaze.

488
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,880
But we would like you to update this
classic and transform it into a

489
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,440
modern showpiece.

490
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,000
The showpiece must showcase at least
two delicious flavours and feature

491
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,880
exceptional technique.

492
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,480
There you have it, chefs.
They must feed 24 people,

493
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,800
or one very hungry person.

494
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,320
Now, you have four hours today to
complete your modern religieuses,

495
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
and your time starts now.

496
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,120
Ready to go!

497
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Religieuse is the French word
for nun,

498
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,320
and this profiterole-type dessert is
said to resemble the faithful

499
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,920
sisters with two beautifully
decorated choux buns.

500
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,080
So we're testing their abilities to
take that classic into a wow factor.

501
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,160
Height, skills.

502
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,080
It needs to be baked beautifully
as well.

503
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,040
I have to have a nice smooth texture
to give me a good V when I lift up.

504
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,800
It's almost there. All my students
know about a flappy V.

505
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,360
CHUCKLING

506
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
When I bite into the choux, it
should be a beautiful,

507
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,040
crispy exterior and a light, airy,
pillowy interior,

508
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,520
exploding with beautiful flavour.

509
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,480
We are now at this stage of the
competition when you cannot afford

510
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,120
to waste any minute. So they have to
crack on from the first minute go

511
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,320
and make sure they use every
available time they've got to

512
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,160
produce something special.

513
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
While most teams are preparing
classic choux buns...

514
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,200
Obviously, choux pastry should have
freehand piping.

515
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,200
..hoping to improve on yesterday's
chaotic performance,

516
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,760
Graham has developed a method that
could deliver stability for the base

517
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,640
of his religieuses. I've used
Yorkshire pudding tins because

518
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,240
I just want a flat, even keel,
really, so it doesn't, urp,

519
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,800
you know what I mean?
It doesn't seesaw.

520
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,280
His hopefully perfect choux will be
filled with Turkish

521
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,920
delight flavoured creme patissiere
and chocolate mousse,

522
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,400
and they'll sit beneath a showpiece
made entirely of chocolate that's

523
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,720
been inspired by their
favourite sport.

524
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,360
It's going to be a group of tyres.

525
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,360
Did you say tyres?

526
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,040
Tyres. And then we have an exhaust
that comes out the top. Wow.

527
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,320
And a little wow on the top of that,
just for you guys.

528
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,000
Oh. OK, great, so... You wanted wow,

529
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,080
so we're going to try and give you
wow. OK.

530
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
Appreciated, appreciated.

531
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,240
I saw you using a cake tin for your
choux pastry. Yes.

532
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,320
Well, this reminds me of
Yorkshire puddings.

533
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,680
Yes. I love Yorkshire puddings.

534
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,440
There may be a modern twist in
the presentation.

535
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,280
Slav and Maria are also creating
their showpiece from chocolate,

536
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,720
but theirs is perhaps more in
keeping with the religieuse theme.

537
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,960
Maria at the moment is making a
Bible book.

538
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,200
Oh, yeah? A Bible book?

539
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,600
Yes. A chocolate Bible book?

540
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,400
Yes. Do you think this is the first
chocolate Bible book ever?

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,440
Their chocolate Bible will be
surrounded by classic religieuses,

542
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,040
filled with chocolate creme
patissiere and hazelnut praline,

543
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,560
and towering above them all will be
a chocolate church spire decorated

544
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,200
with candles, white chocolate roses
and tempered chocolate leaves.

545
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,960
Can you eat the leaf?

546
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,320
Not the leaf.
But it's like five a day, innit?

547
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,560
LAUGHTER

548
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,120
It might not be your best salad
choice for today.

549
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,920
Could be.

550
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Leanne and Romain will also be
building with chocolate.

551
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,560
We're making a chocolate Black
Forest-themed showpiece.

552
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,280
But, after a failed roulade made
with Swiss roll sponge...

553
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,080
We're more confident with
chocolate work.

554
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
..and an opera without a jaconde,

555
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,960
they're now planning a religieuse
without a choux.

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,920
I saw that you mould a lot of
spheres.

557
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
What is that for? To modernise it.

558
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
We're having a chocolate base.

559
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,000
You've seen religieuses before,
in France?

560
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,760
I know. It's a big choux and a
small choux.

561
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,120
So the base is a choux or it's not
a choux?

562
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,680
No, the base is half a sphere of
dark chocolate.

563
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,080
Oh. Because you wanted it modern, so
I didn't want to be...

564
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,600
OK. Is that going to be enough
choux?

565
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880
I think so.

566
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,760
Their half chocolate sphere bases
will hold dark chocolate diplomat

567
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,240
cream with a sour cherry insert.

568
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,480
Their choux topping will be filled
with a Kirsch diplomat cream.

569
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,160
And these modern religieuses will
inhabit a Black Forest represented

570
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,160
by an ornate chocolate tree.

571
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,720
I'm always concerned with you,

572
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,360
how much you are putting yourself
under pressure...

573
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,760
We're fine. Will you have the time
to actually finish?

574
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,720
Let's choux off. We're going to
choux off.

575
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,560
Good luck. See.

576
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,880
Bye.

577
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,160
While three teams pray to the gods
of chocolate...

578
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Perseverance, patience, all the
traits I haven't got.

579
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,720
..for their showpieces,

580
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,400
the WI Cookery School and the Savoy
are putting their faith in the holy

581
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,080
trinity of toasted almonds, sugar
and even more sugar.

582
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,720
Our showpiece is made out of
nougatine, which is a caramel.

583
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,440
Traditionally, you would serve it on
a nougatine piece.

584
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,240
The Savoy's ornate, triple-tiered
nougatine display stand will be

585
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,520
topped with elegant strands
of white chocolate.

586
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Their religieuses will be filled
with caramel cremeux and yuzu curd,

587
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,960
and will be decorated with hazelnut
puree hair and transparent sugar

588
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,400
work hats. The nougatine is not
something that gets made very

589
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,840
much nowadays, so we want to give it
a go and push ourselves a bit more.

590
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,880
Kelly and Katie are pushing the
traditional nougatine even further.

591
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
So I do a lot of wedding cakes and
celebration cakes,

592
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,800
but wedding cakes are definitely my
favourite thing to do.

593
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,240
I do like that traditional stacked
look, so we're going to stack it up.

594
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,800
I think we're going to have
four tiers.

595
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,920
Their bid to stay in the competition
will see a traditional nougatine

596
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,960
tower piled with cherry, chocolate
and Kirsch-filled religieuses,

597
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,680
but topped with a less than
traditional beignet, or doughnut,

598
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,040
made with ricotta and tarragon.

599
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,880
Yesterday, you had a pretty
disastrous attempt at the roulade

600
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,840
because you were using kind of
odd flavours.

601
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,600
Mm-hm. And today you bring tarragon.

602
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,880
Yes. It's kind of like an aniseed
taste, isn't it?

603
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880
It is. Yes. It's all about balance.

604
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,280
You guys nail the balance,

605
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,640
you've got something which
potentially is extraordinary.

606
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,720
Chefs, you are halfway through.

607
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,480
Watch your backs. Two hours left.

608
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,280
This is hot caramel, so 170,
above 170 degrees.

609
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,520
Super hot. Nougatine cooks at 170
degrees and,

610
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,680
unless it's worked straight from the
oven...

611
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,160
Ow, ow, ow.

612
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,560
..it's impossible to cut or shape.

613
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,080
I'm wearing the gloves.

614
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,000
You've gone rogue, haven't you?
I've gone rogue. You be careful.

615
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,160
No, no, no, no. I've got breakage.

616
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
Nougatine, it's just not quite
playing ball.

617
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,720
Oh, that's like... Ow!

618
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,880
Oh, BLEEP.

619
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,160
Katie's touched molten caramel with
her bare hand.

620
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,160
What an idiot. Sorry, Kelly.

621
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,640
It's all right, don't worry.

622
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,720
As per usual, perfect when we did it
in practice, but on the day...

623
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,880
Burning yourself never helps.

624
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,800
Kelly now faces building
their showpiece on her own.

625
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,680
BLEEP. Is that hurting? Stinging a
little bit, is it?

626
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,840
I am not doing any more caramel.

627
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,040
So, I'll leave that
there for you. Yeah.

628
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,040
Unable to continue nougatine
construction with her burnt hand,

629
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,040
Katie now needs to focus all of
her attention on the religieuse.

630
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
Right. Tube.

631
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,640
Fill? Yes, please.

632
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,160
Chefs, you've got an hour left!
You got one hour left!

633
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,600
I hurt.

634
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
The judges have demanded
perfectly formed, crisp,

635
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,440
well filled, choux buns.

636
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,600
Make sure they're
filled, all of them.

637
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,560
Yes. Don't miss any.

638
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,720
Something that one team aren't
quite ready to deliver.

639
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,680
Um... Some of them are a bit flat.

640
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,680
Seriously, it does look
like a Yorkshire pudding!

641
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,840
It may be part of the design they
want to apply, but it's true.

642
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,400
It looks a little bit strange.

643
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,080
I think I'll pipe it, mate.

644
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,560
Graham's decided to start the choux
for the base of his religieuse

645
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,320
all over again.

646
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,360
They are in trouble. And then they
have Turkish delight, which is rose.

647
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,160
I hope they're not going
to give me a bar of soap.

648
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,920
It'll only take 20 minutes to cook.

649
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,920
They're not coming out, and I don't
want to bang them too much

650
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,320
cos I don't want to shatter them.

651
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,200
Cafe Royale. He will have only one
choux bun on that religieuse.

652
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,600
The base will be a chocolate shell.

653
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,360
I hope it's not going
to be too heavy.

654
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,040
We're going to blast
freeze that one.

655
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,600
Can't taste the caramel.

656
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,440
The Savoy. Do... You could think
they are comfortably ahead,

657
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,400
after yesterday's challenge.

658
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,240
But they're taking risks,
they're working with nougatine.

659
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,680
BLEEP

660
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,760
R Chocolate. They are building
the religieuse already.

661
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
They are super organised.

662
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,400
They look beautiful.

663
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,880
So this is our beignet.

664
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,880
So, this is a mixture of cottage
cheese, vanilla, tarragon,

665
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,040
and choux pastry.

666
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,480
The WI. Tarragon?

667
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
Ricotta? And chocolate?

668
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,640
And maybe fish and chip?
Oh la, oh la, oh la.

669
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,040
45 minutes left to secure
a place in the competition.

670
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,160
She wants them identical,
doesn't she?

671
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
Not bad.

672
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
I'm so happy.

673
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,880
And with time running out,

674
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,720
there's still 24 delicate religieuse
to fill and to decorate...

675
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
No...

676
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,720
..and stunning centrepieces
to construct.

677
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,120
Look at that. Good mate, very good.

678
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
HE CHUCKLES

679
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,800
I'm just making sure everything's
level, so that,

680
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,160
when we build with it, it's
not going to topple over.

681
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,360
Building with chocolate...

682
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
..or nougatine, is
challenging enough.

683
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
But Eddie and Mahshid...

684
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,040
..are using both.

685
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,960
Obviously, we've got to make sure
that everything is there and that

686
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
you're ready to go.

687
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Spray.

688
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,440
I'm getting the flowers out.

689
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,200
Right? Yes. And we're almost there.

690
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,640
It looks like a piece of art.

691
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,920
Does it? Yeah.

692
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,760
Picasso would be jealous,
I'm telling you.

693
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,800
Very gently.

694
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:02,560
You got it? Yeah.

695
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,920
Ready? Yeah. Here we go.

696
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
Got it?

697
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,480
Uh, with your hands on
the back. Yes. I think...

698
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,640
..about over...

699
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,240
No, no, no. Behind,
please. Oh, OK. Just...

700
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,400
Yes. Yeah.

701
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,920
Chefs! Five minutes left!

702
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,400
So, start putting your choux on,
we're going to leave the house!

703
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,200
Team Silverstone on it.

704
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
BLEEP

705
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,080
BLEEP

706
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,280
BLEEP

707
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,880
Quick, quick, quick. We
only have a few minutes.

708
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,520
Start doing the sugar,
leave the mushrooms.

709
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,240
Come on Maria, we can do this.
Yes, we can do this! Come on.

710
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,320
BLEEP

711
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,240
Bring the spray. Spray, spray... Oh!

712
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,240
This one is falling, Eddie.

713
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,240
One minute, chefs. You
have one minute left.

714
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,240
Just put the things on,
don't worry if they fall.

715
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
BLEEP

716
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,200
One fell on the top.

717
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,080
Chefs! Time is up.

718
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,600
BLEEP

719
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,600
Please step away from your displays.

720
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,680
Beautiful.

721
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,640
Beautiful.

Everything looks really cool.

727
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,880
Yeah, definitely.

728
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,840
Nougatine, whose BLEEP idea was
that?

729
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,920
Mine.

At least they're not from the croque
today.

734
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,080
The structure actually looked alive.

735
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,400
There's a finger clawing up

736
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,880
and it's quite magical when you look
at it.

737
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:47,120
But that little choux bun is as good
as it gets.

738
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,880
In terms of the way it looks, the
shape,

739
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,080
should we have had two instead of
just one?

740
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,040
Well, we need to find out.

741
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,560
Ooh.

742
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,960
Ah!

743
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,080
I believe that little choux bun...

744
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,560
..is actually lovely.

745
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
A little too much Kirsch,

746
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,320
but the texture - very creamy,

747
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,160
works very well with the choux
pastry.

748
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,240
I'm not sure about the chocolate
cheddar,

749
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,680
it's more like profiteroley
than religieusely.

750
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,280
The Kirsch I think is all right
for me, however,

751
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,160
I think it's too much chocolaty in
the cup.

752
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,520
But this...

753
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,520
..is a pretty, pretty gateau.

00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,160
..pretty rough.

757
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,480
And you went all out with nougatine.

758
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,400
And the little ridges makes no
effort either to lift it all up.

759
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,360
Car crash, which comes to mind.

760
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,200
The choux bun, nice and crispy.

761
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,400
I like the Chantilly.

762
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,880
There's a creaminess to it, but the
caramel flavour is... Right.

763
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:21,720
..is too mild, especially...

764
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:25,320
..when you get to eat with it, the
yuzu.

765
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,720
How I wish there was more caramel in
there.

766
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,680
It just doesn't balance well at all.

767
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,080
Thank you very much. Thank you.

Thank you.

774
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,800
Personally I find the theme a bit
dark.

775
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,640
Religion is not just about the dark
side,

776
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,560
but there's a lot of joy together.

777
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,560
I would have loved to have seen a
bit more colour,

778
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,000
but how about the little nuns?

779
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,480
Buy me this all day.

780
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,360
It's lovely. Thank you.

781
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,520
Very silky.

782
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,320
I love the hazelnut flavour.

783
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:25,080
You can feel the crunchiness of your
choux.

784
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,400
I love it. Chocolate is very, very
well-balanced.

785
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,920
You feel all the choux.

786
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,880
I think it's well done.

787
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,560
Yeah. Thank you very much.

793
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,200
It's a very masculine showpiece.

794

Tyres, OK, I get the picture.

795
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,600
But as a choux religieuse,
it's a little bit rough.

796
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,680
That's not very well domed.

797
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,480
It's a bit flat. You've covered it
with colouring powder and stuff.

798
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,920
This is clumsy.

799
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:27,800
When I cut through, it your filling
is not overpowering.

800
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,800
However, Chef...

801
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,880
I mentioned so many times about
gelatine - again, it's bouncing.

802
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,880
If I throw on the wall, I'm sure
they will bounce back!

803
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:41,000
The texture I got is nice,
well-balanced,

804
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,520
I like the little jelly on the side

805
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,560
and the chocolate mousse is
flavoursome.

806
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,880
So...

807
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,800
A bit better than yesterday. Mm-hm.

808
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,440

811
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,400
The structure is missing a lot to be
able to say it's a showpiece.

812
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,720
It's more like a stand -
and a badly made one.

813
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,120
You can see that it's very
inconsistent in your piping.

814
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,400
If I come to your shop
to buy your pastry...

815
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,080
..I will be a very unhappy customer.

816
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,520
Whoops.

817
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:37,480
I would expect more in the filling.
It is not acceptable.

818
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,800
If I go to your shop, I have this...

..complain straightaway.

820
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:46,040
So, that little tarragon beignet

821
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,840
actually is not too strong
in tarragon and actually works.

822
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,440
And, actually, the cream underneath

823
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,440
is well-balanced with tarragon,
as well.

824
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,640
Mine is not cooked, as you can see.

825
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:02,920
I would not even pay a single cent
for these religieuses.

826
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:07,360
We've still got
a few positives from that.

Yesterday was a good day.
Today was a bad day.

It did look a lot masculine,

833
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,120
but I think Formula 1
is quite a masculine sport.

834
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,000
We're masculine, aren't we?
Well, we are.

835

necessarily a bad thing

856
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,920
to fall, as well, a little bit -
fall from grace -

857
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,680
and pick yourself up
and make yourself better.

00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,560
Well done, Slav. Give me a hug.

Now the second set of heats come to
an end...

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,800
Kelly, can you handle this?
I've got this.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,040
..as the team's taken a recipe
that's a total mystery...

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
What am I doing wrong? Oh...

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,440
And try to capture the magic of
the four seasons in one majestic
chocolate showpiece.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,440
A bird on a twig in a tree?
Why not?

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,960
With the last places in the
final six at stake...

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
BLEEP.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,240
Which three teams will spring
forward...

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,440
BLEEP.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,520
And who will fall... ALL: Oh, no!
Oh!

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,000
Out of the competition?

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,280
I just want to cry now.

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,240
It's chocolate week.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,760
And of these four teams,

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,200
just three can progress to the final
stages of the competition.

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,400
To make sure only the best go
through,

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,480
the judges have raised the bar with
a secret challenge.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,080
Good morning, chefs!

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,360
Given what's about to happen,
you all look suitably terrified.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,520
Because today, you will face
a secret recipe challenge.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
The judges are about to surprise you
with the name of a classic dessert,

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,840
which they will then expect you to
make with no practice or preparation
whatsoever.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,280
It's like a surprise party, but the
most horrible surprise party ever!

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,240
Cherish, please reveal today's
secret recipe.

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,640
We have chosen a classic
Austrian cake.

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
Sachertorte.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,400
We will expect to see a moist
chocolate sponge with apricot jam,

53
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,440
and a smooth ganache glaze.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,320
We would like you to serve your
Sachertorte on a chocolate stand,

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,800
and topped with a bicolour,
handcrafted chocolate flower.

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,240
Chefs, you have 3.5 hours
to complete today's secret
recipe challenge.

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,560
And your time starts now.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,920
OK. Blimey.

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,720
Wow.

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,200
I haven't tasted Sachertorte
before, ever.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
So I'm a little bit confused.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,640
Today, there is a little bit of a
twist.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,040
They could not prepare
for our secret recipe challenge.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,120
Let's get scribing.

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,120
They have to bring their knowledge
and instinct to make this work.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,000
CHERISH: When building the
structure,

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,160
we would like to see the creativity
of the chef.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,440
However, it needs to be strong
enough to hold the cake.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,240
I do not want to see a collapse.

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,200
What's this for? We can use it for
the stand.

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,080
Each team has been given various
moulds, paints,

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,320
and utensils to help them create
their chocolate stands.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,920
How is this related...to a
Sachertorte?

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
I mean, we haven't
worked that one out yet ourselves.

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Come on. Spray, spray, spray,
spray, spray.

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,840
It's the Eddie and Mashid show!
Hi! Guys, is this your sponge?

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
I'm worried you might need to do it
again.

78
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,480
I think it's going to be very
tough...

79
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,960
Who's doing the structure? I'm
working on the structure now.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
This is the legs for the stand that
we're making.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
The legs? Yes. The legs!

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,480
Almost like a lamp table,
do you know...

83
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,040
With the three legs going?

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,840
Oh, yeah! And then we'll put the
cake on top of that.

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,640
Eddie and Mashid
are hedging their bets
with a straightforward approach.

86
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,560
Planning to cast their three-legged
stand low and colour it

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
with a dark red cocoa butter.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
CHERISH: Is that enough to wow us?

89
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
EDDIE: Our aim is just to get
through.

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
Doesn't matter about being first or
second.

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,960
Is this a good move? I think so.
Do what you think is best.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,040
Do what you think would make the
difference with the other three
teams. Yes.

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,680
Pushing themselves a little
further...

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
I need to draw something.

95
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
..last week's winners,
Slav and Maria,

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,360
have come up with a more ambitious
design.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,320
We are in the chocolate industry,
so we are confident.

98
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,640
So I'm going to make a stand with
three different cylinders.

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,200
So one will be here.

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,720
One here. And then, the cake here.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,040
Building a towering trio of tiers
strong enough to support

102
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,800
a Sachertorte will take

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
all of Slav's well-honed expertise.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,920
When I was younger,
I used to be a carpenter.

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,680
It's a bit of building a table
or kitchen.

106
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,160
So for me, when I come to the final
product, it makes me really happy.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,400
Right, here we go.

108
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,640
Here we go.

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,480
The teams get to work casting their
centrepieces.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
If they don't work quickly...
Whoops. Sorry.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,560
..their stands won't set strong
enough to hold their cakes.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
Can you pass me that ring, Kelly?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
I might put something there to kind
of keep it stable.

114
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,480
Despite just scraping through
last week,

115
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,280
the WI Cookery School
are still aiming high.

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,760
Kelly and Katie's delicately cast
sky-scraping pillar should result

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,640
in a gravity-defying stand.

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,000
My pole's too big. I'm scared.

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,160
Oh, no. Good luck, mate,
you've got this. Let's go for it.

120
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
Determined to secure their place
in the final six,

121
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,680
Hotel Cafe Royal
are also taking a risk.

122
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
I was thinking of just doing
a circle...

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,400
But then I guess it'll be too
simple.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,480
With an instinctive approach...

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,200
Do you have any drawing for your
stand?

126
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,800
Yes, it's there. Oh, it's there?

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,560
Ooh! Leanne doesn't know it?

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,360
I draw it, so it's going to be like
this and like that, and like this...

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
And then stand, and probably flower
here... Something like that. OK.

130
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,200
Ooh, I think I've seen one of those
in hospital.

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,480
LAUGHTER
Was he alive?

132
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
If flying by the seat of his pants
wasn't daring enough,

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,640
Romain also plans to carve a gaping
hole in the centre of his stand.

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,440
I've come up with an idea, but I
know it's going to take me time.

135
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,400
I really don't want to be in
trouble, so...

136
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
I'm running into difficulty.

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Oh...

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
That's horrible.

139
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,240
All right. BLEEP.

140
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,440
Oh... Chefs! You have two hours
left, two hours left!

141
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,640
Oh, don't do that.

142
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,880
You can do the next one. Fine.

143
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,920
If wondering whether their
chocolate elements will set in time

144
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
wasn't stressful enough...

145
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,600
Right, done, done, done, done, done.

146
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
Let's go for it.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,320
There's also a classic Austrian cake
to perfect.

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,880
The Sachertorte is
all about the sponge!

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,040
Use the wrong ratio,
it becomes very dry.

150
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,480
Over bake it, it becomes very dry.

151
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,640
It's about understanding what you're
trying to achieve with this sponge.

152
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
Then move to the jam.

153
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
The strong, fresh flavour of
apricot needs to be present.

154
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,520
And there is the glorious dark
chocolate ganache,

155
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
which will finish it off.

156
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,480
It's very important that the chef
has the knowledge to execute the
basic recipe.

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,840
I expect them to get it right.

158
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,800
No mistake should be made.

159
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,080
Right, I'm going to start working
out the sponge.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,880
OK.

161
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,400
The judges have given each team all
the ingredients they need...

162
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,840
We mix these together, and add that
to our ganache.

163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,920
No.

164
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,040
..but not the method.

165
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,000
This is pretty much like
a technical, isn't it?

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,840
Pretty much. It's a bit of a
guessing game today.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
See, I've never tried one.

168
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,600
Like, do you know what to expect in
terms of the texture, or...

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,840
Not really, I don't know really
know neither how it is.

170
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,160
None of us have
actually tried one before.

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,520
R Chocolate! How do you feel about
the secret recipe challenge?

172
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,080
Feeling very good. Are you familiar
with this?

173
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,320
Yeah, I've been to the Sacher Hotel
in Vienna...

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,320
Ah, wow! Where the cake originated,

175
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,280
so I'm looking forward to making
something similar.

176
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,440
OK, we shall see.

177
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,280
LIAM: In order to create the
perfectly light sponge the judges
are looking for,

178
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,600
the chefs must work precisely.

179
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,200
I was thinking a egg yolk,
then the flour, then fold it into
the meringue at the end.

180
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,320
Great. I've had a child since I last
made it. I'm rusty.

181
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,480
Get the order wrong, and their
mixture will become too dense,

182
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,280
and the sponge could collapse.

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
The other day, I was just looking
through recipes,

184
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
and I saw the Sachertorte, and
I was like, no,
they're not going to give us that.

185
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,680
And I just flicked through it.

186
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
I hope it's correct, what I'm doing.

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,040
I feel like I need to do a double
recipe,

188
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,920
because the quantity's quite small.

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,000
Everything done? No, no, I need to
add the meringue now.

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,880
Yes. Yes. Fold it. Yes.

191
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
Here's the sponge, is it OK?

192
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,480
I think so. You think so.

193
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,320
Just bake it and see.

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,680
I think I'm going to make a double
recipe, I'm going to go for it.

195
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
It looks such a mess. It's OK.

196
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,280
All right, mate, what do you think
of that mixture? Yeah, go for it.

197
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,120
I just hope that the sponge will be
what the judges are expecting.

198
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,760
Really nice, light and moist sponge.

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
To achieve a perfectly moist
Sachertorte...

200
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,160
Right, I'm going in.

201
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
The teams must be exact
with their baking time.

202
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,280
Let's start with 15?
And then we'll check.

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,960
A minute over could leave
their sponges dry.

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
There's no room for error.

205
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,480
How long are you cooking
the cakes for?

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,400
Look.

207
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,600
It was supposed to be 30 minutes,
but... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

208
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,400
She forgot to press start on the
timer.

209
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,480
Halfway through, Chefs, halfway
through!

210
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,440
I am doing the apricot jam.

211
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,520
I used to make a lot of jam
before in Hungary.

212
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,480
Our custom back home was that we
have reserves for the whole winter.

213
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,960
There's a little bit of pressure.
I don't want to lose
the reputation of the WI.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
Not being able to make jam.

215
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,800
Yes, no? Needs a little bit more
lemon juice? Just a touch.

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
BLEEP.

217
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
I think I put too much jam on in.
Maybe add some more puree
then to it.

218
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,800
The jam is beautiful.
BEEPING

219
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,560
That is your timer. Yes!
The moment of truth.

220
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,920
I'm going to open it.

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,520
Go on, let's do it. Risk it.

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,840
Yes, no, maybe? Yeah, it's done.
Yeah?

223
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,400
Slav, this is clean.

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,320
That's it? Perfect.

225
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,520
Mate... Yeah? ..it's done.

226
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,880
Huh? The sponge,
I think it's too hard.

227
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,440
What shall I do, what shall I do,
what shall I do?

228
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
Do a new one. Do a new one.

229
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,720
I just don't remember the order.

230
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,880
Something I'm not doing correctly, I
don't know quite what it is yet.

231
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,040
Pancake? We're making it again.

232
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,880
You're making your sponge, yeah?
Yes.

233
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,280
Chefs, you have one hour left!
That's one hour!

234
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
What am I doing wrong?

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
Oh, come on!

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
Standard components...

237
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,000
The chocolate's set.

238
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
..ready for action.

239
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
Yeah, not bad.

240
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,920
Honestly, do you know
what it reminds me of?

241
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,600
I know what you mean.
HE LAUGHS
Go away.

242
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,200
Now their designs must be
put to the test.

243
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,760
I'm now going to start assembling
the stand.

244
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
All right, scary bit now.

245
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,520
To avoid the unthinkable...

246
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
Just to make sure the cake and stay
on it,

247
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,120
and not everything will collapse.

248
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,440
..every single joint...

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,160
Oh! ..must be perfectly secure.

250
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
No. I'm taking it off.

251
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,000
How's the sponge? Too dense, it's
terrible.

252
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,080
There's something I'm not doing
right.

253
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,560
My mind is blank, what should I do?

254
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,640
It's a ganache and meringue,
definitely.

255
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
Have you got that much?

256
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,760
Is it directly in the middle?
I don't know, you tell me.

257
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
It's not straight...

258
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,920
The angle.

259
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,200
Yeah, no? Yeah. I think so. Yeah.

260
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,320
So, the cake's going directly
on top, as well? Yeah.

261
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,760
Do you think it's going to drop?
Don't... No!

262
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
No, it's not going to drop.
Because you're a structural goddess.

263
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,000
What am I doing wrong?
Come on, come on, concentrate.

264
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,440
Calm down, Mashid, it's OK.
Oh, I remember now!

265
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
What? You fold in the chocolate, and
then the... Oh!

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,800
Start all over again.

267
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,800
Wait, you're making the sponge?
For the third time. What? How come?

268
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,440
So the first time I made it,
it became too dense.

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,040
Then I started again, and then I
remember the method.

270
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,120
So this is the third time, lucky,
I hope.

271
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
Chefs, you have half an hour left!

272
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,360
We have half an hour left.
Come on, Mashid, let's go.

273
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,200
With Mashid's sponge only just in
the oven...

274
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
I pray to God this will work.

275
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,840
..the other teams are ready
to begin layering.

276
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,480
And for the final flourish,
the all-important
chocolate ganache glaze.

277
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,960
It's very important to have a silky
and smooth texture to this.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,960
Consistency is key. Get the wrong
ratio of chocolate and cream,

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,040
and the glaze will be too thick to
pour and could split.

280
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,400
Do you trust me to glaze this?
Mate, I trust you with my life.

281
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,920
I think... Like it, like it,
like that.

282
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,560
This is a very different glaze to
what we normally bake.

283
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,720
And obviously I don't know if we
made it right.

284
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
This is very, very thick.
We're not able to have a nice flow.

285
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,600
Don't take off too much, because
then they will see the layers.

286
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,880
All right, you ready?

287
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,720
It's in the middle. Take your time.

288
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,960
It's not in the middle.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,880
I'm not touching it any longer.
No. No? No, it's going to crack. OK.

290
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,320
Ready? Yep.

291
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
Are we good, are we good,
are we good?

292
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,360
Nope. You've literally just gone
straight into the BLEEP.

293
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,720
It's fine. How long have we got?

294
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,480
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left!

295
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,560
Come on, come on, come on.
That needs to come out sooner.

296
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
What are you doing? I'm doing the
centre for the flower.

297
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,280
The teams still have their delicate
chocolate flower to cast...

298
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,720
Chocolate is setting, setting,
setting.

299
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
..entirely by hand.

300
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,560
I have the world's hottest hands,
so as soon as I touch chocolate,

301
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,960
it just goes... They're not that
bad! There like lukewarm.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,080
Do you think? OK, well, thank you.

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,760
Oh, these leaves are so thin,
Mashid. I hope this holds.

304
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,920
You all right? Just having a few
little, snappy issues.

305
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,000
Oh! We're only going to have one
flower on it.

306
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,920
Because the little petals are
breaking as I was going around.

307
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,000
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

308
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,920
BLEEP.

309
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,080
How is it? Good.
It just needs to cool down fast.

310
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,840
Rock it straight in the blast.

311
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,240
BLEEP! Just put it down, put it
down, put it down.

312
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
BLEEP.

313
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,480
Please stay here!
Stay here, don't move.

314
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,960
Chefs, you have one minute left,
that's one minute!

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
BLEEP. I need to work.

316
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,160
Let's finish first, and then, if we
have time to do that...

317
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
No, no, no, no. Ready? Yeah.

318
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,600
Leaves, leaves.

319
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,200
We need to glaze it. Push it down,
push it down, push it down.

320
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,200
Chefs... Let's move it.
..your time is up!

321
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,640
That is the end of your time.

322
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,800
We could've done more.
Yeah, it's just...the sponge.

323
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
It's fine. If it breaks
in transaction,

324
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
it breaks in transaction.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,200
Four sachertortes and four
handcrafted stands

326
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,280
now face the judgment of
Cherish and Benoit.

327
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,760
Would Leanne and Romain from
Hotel Cafe Royal please come forward

328
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,320
and bring your sachertortes
to the judging table?

329
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,280
I like the whole structure.
It's quite nice.

330
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
I think you've thought about it.

331
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,880
The little flower, you were going in
the direction we wanted to go,

332
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,200
but I wanted more, guys.

333
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,680
What do you understand when
you say a glazed cake?

334
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,960
I would say it's where it's been
poured on top of the cake.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,320
I have a coated cake, so I'm not too
sure whether this met the brief.

336
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,680
Should we taste?

337
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,360
Well, this is not the sacher
I remember.

338
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
The sponge itself is quite dry,
and the jam is too acidic for me.

339
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,560
Did you put anything
in your apricot jam?

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,920
Lemon zest.
OK, well, that's what I got.

341
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,240
That citrusy flavour
when you mix up the dough,

342
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,760
you're almost going orangey.

343
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
You're creating something else.

344
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,600
I don't think we can call this one
quite a sachertorte. No.

345
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,600
But thank you very much for that.
Thank you.

346
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,080
Honestly, it could have been worse.

347
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,280
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

348
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,680
With three and a half hours,
this is what you give me?

349
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,280
I'm not happy about it.
No, neither are we.

350
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,080
First of all, we asked for a glaze,
you give me coat.

351
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,200
Do think this is beautiful enough?

352
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Enough said,
I think it's time to taste.

353
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
I think what works is the fact that
the sponge is not as dry

354
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,800
as it could be.

355
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,760
Again, I would not call this
a sachertorte.

356
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,840
The sponge is supposed to be
full of chocolate...

357
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,080
I don't get it in there.

358
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,400
And also, I think your ganache
is split.

359
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,840
OK. OK, there is always tomorrow.

360
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,800
That was fun!

362
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
Slav and Maria from R Chocolate,

363
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,360
could you please bring your
sachertorte to the judging table?

364
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
Careful, careful, careful.

365
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,320
Well, Chef, I love the way you
used the colour,

366
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,480
the red and the yellow,
but as a whole,

367
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
the finishing is heavy-handed.

368
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,360
I have seen some of your
chocolate work before,

369
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,520
it was a little bit more refined.

370
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,160
But it may still be
beautiful inside.

371
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
I've got some kind of moisture,

372
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,920
and I prefer the sacher to taste
a little bit more chocolate

373
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
than apricots personally,
which is the case.

374
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
Well, as for me,
I love your ganache,

375
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,600
it's very smooth and nice.

376
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
OK, well, all in all,
we're getting there.

377
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,440
It's tasting better than it looks.

378
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,920
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

379
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,760
Katie and Kelly from
The WI Cookery School,

380
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,440
could you please bring your
Sachertorte to the judging table?

381
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
SHE MUMBLES

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,000
Oh! Oh, no!

383
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
Are you serious?

384
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
Deconstructed sachertorte.

385
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
That's the spirit.

386
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,200
I was surprised how it got to stand

387
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,360
for that long,
to be honest with you, but, hey!

388
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,320
If you come up with a design
like this one,

389
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,800
your understanding of structure
is to be worked on.

390
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,680
The sponge to me is baked correctly.

391
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,040
You glazed the cake,
it makes a difference.

392
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,560
The jam is the best I've tasted,

393
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,200
however, look at the lumps
and bumps over here.

394
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,320
If you could have executed nicely,

395
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
this could be a very nice
piece of work.

396
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
Well, thank you very much.

397
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,120
BLEEP.

398
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,760
We made a sachertorte
that was palatable.

399
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
If we go out, we go out,

400
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
but at least we'll go out
with a bang.

401
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,480
Absolutely. Literally. Yeah.

402
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,920
We need to work hard tomorrow,
my God.

403
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
We have to really sit down tonight,

404
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,640
talk about our strategy, our plan.

405
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,160
Focus our energy, everything we have
on the showpiece tomorrow,

406
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
and then hopefully that will
get us through.

407
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
TOM: Ahead of tomorrow's
showpiece challenge,

408
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,800
the teams have been given a golden
hour to prepare elements

409
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,240
that need moulding
or sitting overnight.

410
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,920
Looking at the judging,
I thought it was a bit savage,

411
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,160
but it was probably fair.

412
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,840
I think it was a disastrous morning.

413
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,680
No disrespect of the candidates,

414
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,800
it was something they were not
expecting to get.

415
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,400
So, who do you think
was in the lead?

416
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,040
Potentially R Chocolate,
because they've done a sachertorte

417
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
which is more pleasant to eat.

418
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,280
And who is in trouble?

419
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,680
Eddie and Mahshid.

420
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,760
They clearly went without
a strategy,

421
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,160
and that was their downfall.

422
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,960
You need to stand back
and you need to analyse.

423
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,800
So, let's talk about The WI.
Before it fell, yeah,

424
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,880
I thought the chocolate gods
were with them.

425
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,440
Let's be honest about it, they lived
in denial that this would stand.

426
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,960
It's not if, but when,
this is happening.

427
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,560
I cannot see the spark in their eyes
today that they want to win.

428
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,160
I hope that they come back fighting
tomorrow.

429
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,640
Can they deliver?

430
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
Let's just hope the teams have
a better day tomorrow.

431
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,560
I'm sure that they can do it,

432
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,560
they just need to turn up
the power a little bit.

433
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,120
Morning.

434
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,160
TOM: Just three coveted places
in the final six remain.

435
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,160
LIAM: And this showpiece challenge
is the last chance the teams

436
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
will have to stake their claim.

437
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,520
So, judges, what have you in mind
for this chocolate showpiece?

438
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
Should it double as an abacus?

439
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
Have a conscious soul?

440
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,200
Be able to do the washing up
before you eat it?

441
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
We expect you to make
a spectacular showpiece,

442
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,000
standing at least 70cm high
and inspired by four seasons.

443
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,280
Your showpiece must feature

444
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,160
two different types of moulded
and filled chocolates, 24 of each,

445
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,800
and your showpiece must also
include a moving part.

446
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,720
Chefs, you had one hour last night
to prepare, and you have

447
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,880
four hours remaining to complete
today's showpiece challenge.

448
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,760
And your time starts now.

449
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,960
Right, are you ready for this?

450
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,280
To earn a place in the final six,

451
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,240
the teams must prove their prowess
with chocolate

452
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,800
by bringing to life a showpiece
that captures the splendour

453
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
and complexity of our
ever-changing natural world.

454
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,440
So, the theme is four seasons,

455
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,320
and they can interpret it
whatever way they want,

456
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,440
but it's a showpiece challenge,
we want to be wowed.

457
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,000
There's going to be some more.

458
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,480
They showcase different
technical skill,

459
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,160
like moulding, handcrafting,
sculpturing.

460
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,880
And we have added a moving part.

461
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,480
It could be as simple as
a little drawer or more technical,

462
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,480
and you've got a little
motor somewhere.

463
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,960
To accompany their
seasonal showpieces,

464
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,520
the teams must also produce
48 sumptuous bonbons.

465
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,520
The shell has to be thinly made,

466
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,440
and when I break the chocolate,
it should snap.

467
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,160
The filling needs to be smooth
and the flavour provided show to us

468
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,400
that you understand your taste.

469
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,680
We want to see how good they are
in order to be the best three teams

470
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,560
to go to the next round.

471
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
It's always something I've enjoyed,
chocolate.

472
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,720
I like to be creative and,
you know,

473
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,760
this is like carving a piece of art,
basically.

474
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,080
While the teams are free
to represent as many seasons

475
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,680
as they like, Leanne and Romain

476
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,120
are concentrating all their efforts
on just one.

477
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,720
So you are going to play safe today?

478
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,960
It's not playing it safe.

479
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,600
We're trying to do more finesse.

480
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,080
We're going for spring.

481
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,360
We're going to have some nice, like,

482
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,160
sunflowers on there, and bumblebees.

483
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,120
We're going to have a beehive
that will move.

484
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,840
LIAM: By crafting one set of bonbons
filled with zesty raspberry and yuzu

485
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,960
and another containing zingy orange
and cinnamon,

486
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,640
they also hope to capture spring
with their flavours

487
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,120
as well as their design.

488
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,760
Colourful, spring?

489
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,960
Green and yellow.

490
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,360
Because at the beginning
we were thinking about autumn,

491
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
just going to be brown leaves
and stuff like that,

492
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,520
which is not very enjoyable,
I guess.

493
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,320
A point of view not shared
by Eddie and Mahshid.

494
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,480
We chose an autumn theme.

495
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,600
We wanted to focus on one season
and do it nicely for you guys.

496
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,320
I went and collected real leaves,
yeah.

497
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
Wow! Wow!

498
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
Ah, OK, nice. So they're going to
have the real rain

499
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
and the structure on.

500
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,840
TOM: Hoping to put yesterday
behind them,

501
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,840
the Savoy will place
under their tree

502
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,160
green and white flecked
dark chocolates

503
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,360
with crystallised pistachios
and pistachio ganache,

504
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,560
along with gold milk chocolate domes

505
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,080
featuring grapefruit
and gin fillings.

506
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,880
Take us through your moving part.
So, inside the tree trunk

507
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,280
we're going to make some drawers,

508
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
and they'll be filled with our
bonbons inside there, as well. OK.

509
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,640
You cool?

510
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,360
Have to be.

511
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:05,160
We would love to be the king and the
queen of this chocolate challenge.

512
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,680
Convinced their experience
will give them the edge,

513
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,960
chocolate specialists Slav and Maria
are taking on not just one season,

514
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
but all four.

515
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,000
We're going to make a tree which
will have four branches.

516
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,000
Each branch will represent one
season. It's quite a lot to do,

517
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,080
so we need to work hard, I think.

518
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:25,520
White chocolate bonbons flecked with
coffee and filled with Irish cream

519
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,160
and biscotti will be accompanied by
dark chocolates comprised of

520
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,800
passion fruit caramel
and raspberry ganache.

521
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,320
OK, what about your moving part?

522
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
We're going to have a swing.

523
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,880
A what? Swing. A swing, swing.

524
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,680
Yeah. Something on the swing?

525
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,000
I will try to make a bird.

526
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
A bird. Yeah. A bird on a swing.

527
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,640
Why not?

528
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
Just have such a rage inside.

529
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,760
Trying to recover from their
crash landing yesterday,

530
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,080
The WI Cookery School's
Kelly and Katie are also

531
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,440
attempting all four seasons.

532
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
And if that wasn't enough,

533
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,440
they will be incorporating
multiple moving parts.

534
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,920
We've got two mechanisms that
we're going to be doing,

535
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,360
so in the winter part we've got
a conveyor belt,

536
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,080
so we'll pop some of our
chocolates on it,

537
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,920
and they're going to be
rotating through.

538
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,080
A conveyor belt? Yeah.

539
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,880
Interesting, interesting.
Now we are talking. Yeah!

540
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,280
How is it going to be powered?

541
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,360
So it's a motor,
motorised mechanism.

542
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,280
I had to cannibalise a sort of
children's remote-control car.

543
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,920
That is wicked.

544
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,200
They also plan to blaze
a trail with their bonbons -

545
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,640
dark chocolate miso caramel pecan
Florentines

546
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,320
and apricot and honey thyme
ganache milk chocolates

547
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,040
whizzing around the base of
their grand structure.

548
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,040
Our showpiece is going to be a tree.

549
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,600
How you going to make the tree
look like a real tree?

550
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,200
Katie is going to be working on all
the branches coming out of the top,

551
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,800
which she's going to be
hand moulding.

552
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,480
And we're going to then go down it

553
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,440
with brushstrokes to give that
affect of rough bark.

554
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,960
We know that there's
two other trees being made.

555
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,720
So it's going to be a fight. Yeah.

556
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,040
Chefs, you've had an hour,
so that's three hours left.

557
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
It's gone very, very quickly.

558
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,040
So now I am going to start
the bonbons.

559
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,440
Finely tuned elegance is
the hallmark of high-end bonbons.

560
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,360
This one's going to be pistachio.

561
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,160
I will line it with chocolate,
put the filling, and then cap them.

562
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,480
First, they must cast their cases,
which should be gossamer thin.

563
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
This is a very crucial part,
to get the nice bonbon.

564
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,080
It's already setting,
it's so cold in here.

565
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,760
Not too thick, though, are they?
No. No?

566
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,680
But if they don't work fast enough,

567
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,600
the rapidly cooling chocolate
will set too thick in the mould.

568
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
I'm not happy with these shells.

569
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,640
I don't think we can use
any of these.

570
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,200
This is not what we want.

571
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,920
We just have to redo it again,
but it's set me back.

572
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,920
Because then you have to
polish the mould,

573
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,840
everything has to start
all over again.

574
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,880
This is our shell for
the dark chocolate.

575
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,040
I'm happy with it,

576
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,560
so now I'm going to start filling
them up with the caramel.

577
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,640
As well as delicately-cast shells,

578
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,280
they must create fillings
with finesse.

579
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,160
Cantuccini is coming out.

580
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,240
Balancing heavenly textures and
mouthwatering flavours.

581
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,360
I think all the flavours
are quite nice.

582
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,520
Raspberry and yuzu is fresh,
like spring,

583
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,080
and we have orange and cinnamon,
it's a bit more warm.

584
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,560
Let's see what the judges say.

585
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,400
Got some more thyme in there,
I still can't get the smell.

586
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,680
Really? We had some very fragrant
thyme that we practised with,

587
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,960
and this is not so fragrant. No.

588
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
I'm piping raspberry ganache,

589
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,040
which is going to sit on top of
passion fruit of caramel.

590
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,440
It's sweet and then sour.

591
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,040
Pistachios are finest pistachios
in the world, from Iran, of course.

592
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,520
When they bite into it,
it's just not ganache,

593
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,360
they're going to have some crunch
as well.

594
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,520
Mahshid, you haven't even lined it
with chocolate yet.

595
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,480
At least put chocolate in it. Yeah.

596
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,400
So, I'm just capping the truffles.

597
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,560
So then we can just have,
like, lemons

598
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,440
and, like, citrus fruits
at the bottom.

599
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
Bonbons sealed...

600
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,920
They are looking good.

601
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,760
..and setting... In the fridge.

602
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,520
It's time to discover if yesterday's
hard work in the golden hour

603
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,920
has paid off.

604
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,000
How's that?
Oh, that looks beautiful.

605
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,160
Not moving anywhere.

606
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
Properly set, properly.

607
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,520
Can be fragile.

608
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,840
Chocolate that's cooled
and contracted overnight...

609
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,280
Whoops!

610
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
..is extremely delicate.

611
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
It cannot crack.
Luckily I did a spare one yesterday,

612
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,880
I think it was a good thing.

613
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,240
I'm trying to remove the blocks,

614
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,800
don't think they're going
to come out somehow.

615
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,680
The chocolate needs
to warm up a bit.

616
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,320
BLEEP.

617
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,880
Yeah. BLEEP.

618
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,240
With their moving part
firmly stuck...

619
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,920
It's just the worst thing
that could happen right now.

620
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,320
Oh, my God.

621
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
..Eddie and Mahshid have
fallen behind again.

622
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,320
This is a nightmare.

623
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,320
Chefs, you have two hours left!
Two hours!

624
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,880
BLEEPING

625
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,840
As soon as possible, we're going to
start to assemble the piece.

626
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,880
The earlier the better on this one.

627
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,000
While most teams are starting to
bring their Four Seasons showpieces

628
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,920
together...

629
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,720
How's that looking? Beautiful, mate.

630
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,960
..Eddie and Mahshid have lost
valuable time

631
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,520
struggling with their cracked
tree trunk.

632
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,800
I wouldn't wish this on
my worst enemy.

633
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,080
Our friends at the Savoy -
they're throwing everything

634
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,600
they've got at their showpiece
challenge and,

635
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
er, they better be!

636
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,000
Eddie struggled to extract those
drawers and they may be finding

637
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,840
themselves actually in trouble.

638
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,040
We can rectify this.

639
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,440
Don't really have a choice.
We've got to be able to do it.

640
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,720
Our ladies from the WI...

641
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,840
They've four seasons in one tree.
I mean, it's interesting.

642
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
I like the conveyor belt idea,

643
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,680
but could they actually bring it to
fruition?

644
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,400
Yeah. We don't know.

645
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,320
Leanne and Romain.

646
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,840
They're working with spring and they
are going to bring the little bees
with the beehives.

647
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,200
Oh, I like that! Bzzz!

648
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,840
We saved it. And besides, once this
is all set around here,

649
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,880
then it'll give it that structure on
the outside and there won't be any

650
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
more faults.

651
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,280
We'll just have to work at full
speed.

652
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,480
Chefs, you have one hour left.
One hour.

653
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,560
It's the base. It'll have to support
the weight of all the rest,

654
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
so it needs to be strong enough.

655
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,960
I've carved little knots out, just
to give that effect of rough bark.

656
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,360
Less like a telegraph pole now.

657
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,360
Kelly, can you handle this?
I've got this.

658
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,080
I don't think you can handle this...

659
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,880
No, I do think you can handle this!

660
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,760
Breathing life into
their Four Seasons showpieces...

661
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
We're using pipe lagging to create
branches.

662
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,200
It won't hold. This one won't
hold.

663
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,800
That's fine. ..will rest on their
ability to accurately reproduce

664
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,200
the colours and textures found in
nature.

665
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,560
The flower's the thing that's
worrying me the most.

666
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,040
We want to show that we can do them
and they do look nice.

667
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
These flowers look beautiful,
everyone!

668
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,800
They're also precariously near the
edge - I'm just going to say that.

669
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,520
The flowers are on the edge.
It's on the edge.

670
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,240
I feel like that's the way Romain is
as well.

671
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,880
Once it sets, you can easily remove
the actual leaf.

672
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,840
You're left with the back side of
the leaf and it gives a nice effect
on the chocolate.

673
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,240
Damn you!

674
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,360
These blossoms aren't working.
BLEEP this!

675
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,960
I might just forget about these for
a minute.

676
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,240
Chefs, you have 30 minutes left.

677
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,600
Phew!

678
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,920
Now I'm making winter.
I think I'm a bit stressed,

679
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,160
because we have so many elements to
complete.

680
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,520
Oh, BLEEP!

681
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
Come on!

682
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,600
Are you going to fall? Huh?

683
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,080
No, I was talking to this.

684
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,280
Eddie, great apron!

685
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
BLEEP!

686
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,720
I think we're going to need to coat
it. Otherwise, it's going to look
odd. Everything green, then?

687
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,200
OK, but just keep the...
The end black? The end black.

688
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,360
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

689
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,040
That's ten minutes.

690
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,520
BLEEP!

691
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,600
No! Gentle. This is why we have to
be gentle.

692
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,600
BLEEP sake! I'm doing the swing
now,

693
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,960
which is going to be our moving
object.

694
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,720
I don't have the time to execute
what I originally planned.

695
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,880
Ah!

696
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
The beehive keeps cracking.

697
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,200
It's not coming together as smooth
as we wanted it to.

698
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,080
We'll manage something.

699
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,640
I'm worried about this swing.
Careful, it's ripping there.

700
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Whoops!

701
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,000
ALARM BEEPS

702
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,400
Wait, wait. Put the edge on first.

703
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,720
Gentle.

704
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,720
That's OK.

705
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,280
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

706
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,680
That's five minutes.

707
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,040
Voila!

708
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm not happy with the way that
these ones have come out,

709
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,080
but we don't have enough time to
redo.

710
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Look at them bad boys!

711
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
Just cut it.

712
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,960
Spring grass.

713
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm just going to nut the top of the
chocolates.

714
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,080
I don't think I have enough time to
do this now, but I will try.

715
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,880
That's it. Right, my conveyor belt,
it's not working.

716
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,360
Oh, BLEEP! It's the soil, yeah,
it's in the cogs.

717
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,120
Just got to do these drawers quick
and that's it.

718
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,120
Wrong size.

719
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,400
BLEEP! Can you make another strip
with the chocolate,

720
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
so we can cut the other drawer
next?

721
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,960
BLEEP! Two strips of chocolate.

722
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
Chefs, you have one minute to
complete your Showpieces.

723
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,520
Give me the spray.

724
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,400
Something just went click.

725
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,840
Oh, there we go. It's going to look
like BLEEP, but it's something.

726
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,160
At least see if we can get one
drawer in there.

727
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
As long as it fits.
Not fitting in there.

728
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
BLEEP! Do you want me
to give you a hand?

729
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
Actually, no, I'm good. You're good?
Yeah, I've got this.

730
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
Time's up, chefs!

731
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,280
That is the end of the Showpiece
challenge.

732
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,520
Well done! Hey, come here, we've
done all right.

733
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,240
Did you manage?

734
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,560
It's nice. It's good. Well done.

735
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,320
BLEEP! Look at everybody else's.

736
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,160
Oh, my God!

737
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,120
So beautiful. I really like
this green one.

738
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,160
Yeah. Their tree is BLEEP beautiful!
I like their tree.

739
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,760
It's even better than what we did in
practice.

740
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,520
Can I just say, ours looks so
damn cool!

741
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
THEY LAUGH

742
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,040
Four extraordinary Four Seasons
Showpieces made in just five hours.

743
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,960
But who has done enough to earn
their place in the final six?

744
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,560
The structure itself
looks really elegant.

745
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,920
Your flower is very pretty

746
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,160
and your bee bring a little bit
life into your Showpiece.

747
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,360
It's very magical for me.
I think you've nailed this one.

748
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,920
You've delivered something
which is visually attractive

749
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,480
and well-balanced.

750
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,920
But, right in the middle,
you've got the elastic band,

751
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,560
which is defeating a little bit
your presentation.

752
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,560
But, not bad.

753
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,200
What about the chocolates?

754
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,760
I really like
the attention to detail

755
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,920
and it's very neatly finished.

756
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,320
We have a white chocolate,
raspberry and yuzu.

757
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,960
I like the texture
of your chocolate.

758
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,680
I feel the yuzu
more than the raspberry.

759
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,080
Is the raspberry needed here?
Not too sure.

760
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,920
When I taste this,
there's nothing to excite me,

761
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,520
it's just one texture.

762
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
Remind me again, what's in there?

763
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,120
Orange and cinnamon.
Your ganache is completely grainy.

764
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,760
I don't even want to taste whether
there's orange, it just put me off.

765
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,560
So I'd like you to put more effort
into the eating element.

766
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
Thank you. Thank you.

767
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,840
It's my fault, Leanne, I'm sorry!

768
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,720
It was the ganache again.

769
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,320
I feel the autumn,
some nice little leaves.

770
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,440
You show us some technical skill.

771
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,520
However, I think it's not elegant,
it's not well done for me.

772
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
We were asking for a moving part.

773
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,640
This comes out and you've got
a couple more bonbons inside there.

774
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,040
Ah, that's moving. Yeah.

775
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,560
Was there meant to be another
moving part in that hole as well?

776
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,240
Yes, but I broke one last minute.

777
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,400
So instead this is a...
It's a little bird's nest.

778
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,280
It's a little bird's nest, ah!
Shall we taste?

779
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,840
So the red one
is grapefruit marmalade

780
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,920
and grapefruit and gin ganache.

781
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,480
Visually, I think that
it's quite nice,

782
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,080
however, I think the chocolate
is too thick.

783
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,440
The gin is in the ganache?

784
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,960
Yes. I get only the grapefruit.

785
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,520
OK, what about the other one?

786
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,600
The green one is pistachio ganache
with crystallised pistachios inside.

787
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
It's a nice chocolate.

788
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,600
The pistachio flavour is present.

789
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,480
I really like you crystallised
your nuts as well,

790
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,400
and this give a different dimension.

791
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,800
So between the two bonbons,
good potential.

792
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,200
Mmm, yes.

793
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,520
Well done, guys.

794
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
It's good. Mmm.

795
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
I just wanna cry now.

796
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,080
Visually, it looks very stagnant
to me.

797
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,360
There's no movement, there's no
curve, there's no life in there.

798
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,480
I was hoping that you'd have more
finesse in the finishing touch.

799
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,960
Where is the moving part?

800
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,680
The moving part is here.

801
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
LAUGHTER

802
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,040
You have to do better than that!

803
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,240
The Showpieces is just lacking
a bit of the professional skills.

804
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,760
We want to see a bit more.

805
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,360
Careful, your finger.

806
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,760
So we have a white chocolate shell
here,

807
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,600
with grinded coffee and Irish cream
ganache, and there is biscotti.

808
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,600
The most beautiful thing is that you
incorporate some of grounded coffee

809
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,960
into your white chocolate.

810
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,280
It's absolutely beautiful,
the flavour profile is stunning,

811
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,840
but if you present a bonbon
which has a shell that thick,

812
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,720
the pleasure is going, yeah?

813
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,320
What about this one?
Passion fruit caramel,

814
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,000
dark chocolate
and raspberry ganache.

815
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,840
Flavours really strong,
really clean.

816
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,960
Would I have chosen to put raspberry
and passion fruit together?

817
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,880
No. I could have enjoyed it
beautifully

818
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,080
just on your passion caramel.

819
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,280
Yeah, it's like you've got
two different bonbons in one. Yeah.

820
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
HE SIGHS

821
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,600
Where is the four seasons? I only
can see two seasons up there.

822
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,360
There's only two up there, we didn't
get time to do the other side.

823
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,080
So it's unfinished?

824
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,760
I think it's a little bit bare
for me.

825
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,920
There is no life in it.

826
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
It's a pole, basically,
covered with chocolate,

827
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,080
let's not beat around the bush.

828
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,560
Could you please take us
to your moving parts?

829
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,000
So we've got the conveyor belt here,

830
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,000
and then we've also got the
turntable in the spring section.

831
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,080
I really enjoy
that little fellow here.

832
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
Up, down. You see like that - bop!

833
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,600
Oh, he's gone. It's almost like...

834
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,600
Bop! There is an effort, you guys
have thought about it.

835
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,200
So what kind of flavours do we have
in our lovely chocolates?

836
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
We've got an apricot gel,

837
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,000
a clustered honeycomb and a
honey and thyme-infused ganache.

838
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,560
OK, visually, that chocolate
is not well-tempered,

839
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,560
I can see lots of dots over here.

840
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,560
One thing I like here
is the texture.

841
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,600
That honeycomb crumble
I really, really love.

842
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
There's potential to do
a nice chocolate here

843
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,760
but it's not there yet. Next one?

844
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,360
Miso caramel, and we've also made
a pecan Florentine in there.

845
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,960
Careful your fingers! Your casting
is more than your filling.

846
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,080
I'm struggling to taste the miso.

847
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,480
Everything just doesn't balance up
for me.

848
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,920
You've done what you could today,

849
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,480
let's see if it's enough to take you
through the next round.

850
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,720
Perhaps we should have just done
one season.

851
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,320
Based on their performance
across both challenges,

852
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,400
the judges will now rank the teams,

853
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,880
and only the top three will take
their place in the final six.

854
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,280
Nice colour, isn't it? Yeah, you can
feel the energy in the piece.

855
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,560
We're actually really happy with
their comments.

856
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,120
They really liked our chocolates,

857
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,920
even though the bonbon
was not the best.

858
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,840
And here... We would like to go
as far as we can,

859
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,080
but I don't feel like
our performance...

860
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,880
Yeah. ..was that high standard.

861
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,400
We weren't particularly happy with
the end result of what we created,

862
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,920
and chocolate,
I think everybody knows now,

863
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,600
is not my strongest point!

864
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,720
It's untidy... You never want to
enter a competition to fail.

865
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,800
We worked so hard, we have had
so many sleepless nights.

866
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,160
We would love to go through and show
what we're made of

867
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,440
and show a bit more
of what we can do.

868
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,600
Benoit and Cherish
have made their decision.

869
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,880
The team in first place
showed exceptional technique

870
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,560
on their visually striking
Showpiece.

871
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:55,920
Congratulations...

872
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,240
Leanne and Romain
from Hotel Cafe Royal.

873
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,120
You are through to the final stages
of the competition. Woo!

874
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:06,640
In second place are Slav and Maria
from R Chocolate.

875
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:10,160
Congratulations,
we'll also see you again.

876
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,200
Which leaves Kelly and Katie
from the WI Cookery School

877
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,040
and Eddie and Mashid from the Savoy.

878
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,680
After much deliberation,

879
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,000
Benoit and Cherish agreed

880
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,000
that the team who'll be leaving
the competition tonight is...

881
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,120
..Kelly and Katie.

882
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,240
I think we've done ourselves proud.

883
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,960
I'm incredibly proud
of what we've done.

884
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,880
Sorry! Oh, no, don't be, it's fine.

885
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
It's just been such a positive
process, hasn't it?

886
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,040
It has. We were mates,
we're now best mates.

887
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,360
Yeah, we are besties now.
So what more can you want?

888
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,600
SPEAKS FRENCH

889
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,000
Well done. We are first!

890
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,280
We are so happy.

891
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,000
And we've beaten Savoy!
We beat the Savoy, yeah, happy week.

892
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,080
I like your humour...

893
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,440
To go forward in this competition is
an amazing feeling.

894
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,440
We will meet the new friends,
new competitors.

895
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,520
Quick celebration tonight,
and then back to work.

896
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,480
Back to work tomorrow!

897
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:09,360
Next time, love is in the air.

898
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,120
You want the breakfast
in the bed, yeah?

899
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,520
You mean just the two of us?

900
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,360
But will anyone wow
the Venus of Viennoiserie?

901
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,800
CRACKING
Oh, my goodness, can you hear that?

902
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,320
And shine in an
all-sugar Showpiece?

903
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,000
Which five teams will make it
to the quarterfinal...

904
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,600
Right, let's move.
..and whose hearts will be broken?

905
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,680
It is leaning, isn't it?

906
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,920
CRASH
Oh, no!

907
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:47,360

﻿1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,480
It's a super exciting day today

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,920
because the top three teams
from each set of heats

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:09,240
will be meeting each other for the
first time to form the final six -

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:10,680
and this week is romance week.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,600
GASPS: Oh, my goodness! Liam, do you
think they're gonna fall in love?!

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,600
No. That's just the theme
of the challenges.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,760
Oh, I bet they will, though.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
They've got so much in common -
and yet they're deadly rivals.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,440
It's gonna be like
Romeo and Juliet -

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,840
forbidden love
across the kitchen floor!

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,200
Ignore him. Thus, with a cake I die.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,160
And welcome back to
Bake Off: The Professionals.

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,520
Last time, the teams faced the might
of the four seasons.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,600
No!

15
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,640
Leanne and Romain from
the Hotel Cafe Royal

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,760
brought the competition to life...

17
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,160
It's very magical for me.

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
..and took first place...

19
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,920
What am I doing?

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,280
..whilst the Savoy's Eddie and
Mahshid had serious timing issues...

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,960
With three and a half hour,
I'm not happy about it.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,320
..but it was the WI cookery school's
Katie and Kelly who toppled...

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,000
Argh!

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,080
..from the competition.

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,080
Now, love is in the air...

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Cos BLEEP.

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
Absolute BLEEP.

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,160
..but will the judges fall for
breakfast pastries...

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
..and swoon over romantic
sugar showpieces?

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,440
Oh, la, la, la, la!

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,000
With only five quarterfinal places
up for grabs...

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,240
It's one chance only.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
..who will be on a promise...

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,440
You wanted breakfast in the bed,
yeah?

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,240
..and whose hearts will be broken?

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,840
Don't bloody rush it
for the sake of it.

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,720
# It must be love, love, love. #

38
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
CLATTERING

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,240
MUSIC: Requiem, Dies irae
by Verdi

40
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,640
The top three teams from
both sets of heats

41
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,960
have come
together to form the final six...

42
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,960
..and, to mark the occasion,

43
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,360
the judges are about to raise the
competition to a whole new level.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,200
Welcome back, chefs,

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,760
and congratulations on making it
to the final six.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,440
Now, because this week's theme
is romance,

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,760
the judges have decided to test you
on the patisserie

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,840
they are most passionate about.

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,920
Benoit and Cherish would like you to
make two types of Viennoiserie -

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,480
or breakfast pastries,
as most people call them.

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,320
I want you to make 24 perfectly
executed croissants.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,960
It has to be buttery,
flaky and identical.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
I am very passionate
about croissants.

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
Now, Benoisserie,
may I call you that?

55
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,120
No. I'm sorry, Benoit.

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,440
What would you like the chefs
to prepare?

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,800
24 Viennoiserie creations,
that we've never seen before.

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
Part Viennoiserie,
part something else altogether.

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,440
I'm crazy for Viennoiseries and I'd
like you to get a little crazy, too.

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
Chefs, you had 30 minutes
last night to prepare,

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,360
and you have three and a half hours
to complete today's challenge.

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,160
Good luck, and your time starts now.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,080
Which stove are you using?

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
Stove one is the Danish.

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
The other one is the croissants.

66
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,560
This is it.
We've got the final six teams.

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
With the Viennoiserie creation,

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,600
we want them to use
a classic Viennoiserie -

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
mix it up with anything you want,
and recreate a new one.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,560
So, I could give you, for example,
the doissant -

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,960
which is a combination
of a doughnut and a croissant.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You have to come up with something

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,360
we wished we would have
thought about.

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
As well as inventing an original
breakfast pastry,

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,440
the teams will also have to juggle
the constant folding and chilling

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
required to perfect the dough
for a classic croissant.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,480
What I'm looking for

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,560
is that it has to be buttery
when you taste.

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,080
It has to be flaky,

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,400
and the lamination has to be
prominent and precise -

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
and, when I cut through the
croissant,

82
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,480
I like to see this beautiful
honeycomb texture.

83
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,000
It seems simple, but it is very
technical to get it perfect.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,560
Laminating, shaping,
proving and baking two pastries

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
in just three and a half hours

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,000
will require the teams to manage
their heavy workload carefully.

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm just portioning up the brioche

88
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,920
so I can get this in the prover as
quick as possible.

89
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,000
Mahshid's already started
the croissants.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,360
Like most of our teams,

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,280
Eddie and Mahshid from London's
world-famous Savoy Hotel

92
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,120
aren't used to
perfecting Viennoiseries.

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
Do you guys make croissants
a lot in the hotel?

94
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
We don't, no, the bakers do.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
What? What? There's another team?

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,280
Yeah. So, what you do all day?

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
We do the pastries. I didn't know
there was a difference.

98
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,680
So, Viennoiserie creation,
what have you prepared for us?

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
We're gonna do a briole.

100
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,320
Briole. It's half brioche
and half profiterole.

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,640
Eddie's briole will have
a brioche base,

102
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
a choux pastry top,

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
filled with hazelnut mousseline

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
and decorated with crushed nuts

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,200
and dark chocolate craquelin.

106
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,760
How do you place your choux pastry
in your brioche?

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
So, we prove the brioche first,

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,200
and then we're going to pipe in our
choux pastry mix,

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
and then on top,
it gets the craquelin.

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,440
And who created this?

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,720
Er, we did.
You created, both of you?

112
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,960
Yeah, we just came up with something
different. Gosh!

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
Might be a good invention, isn't it?

114
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,360
It is completely what we were asking
for - try something different -

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
something we potentially haven't
seen before.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
Yeah.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,480
While imagination is key
for the Viennoiserie creation...

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,400
We need come up with something
different

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,920
which hasn't been invented.

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
..for the classic croissant,
a strict path has to be followed.

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,840
Simple ingredients,
so process is important.

122
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,400
How is your butter?

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
It seems a bit soft.

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,200
If the butter is too warm
when it is folded into the dough,

125
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
during baking, it will leak out
of the pastry

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,760
causing layers of
lamination to collapse.

127
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,840
Too cold and it won't spread
to the edges of the dough,

128
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,440
leaving areas that won't have any
lamination at all.

129
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
This is not good at all.

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,880
Did you take the temperatures?

131
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,240
No. I said, "We need to take the
temperatures."

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,760
Cos there's all this dough here -

133
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
all this dough here,

134
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
and the butter's not been
folded in properly. I'm sorry.

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,440
The temperature of my butter
and the dough are not the same.

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,560
I forgot to check the temperature.

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
I just started folding in,

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
and so, as you can see,

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,240
we have a lot of dough, and the
butter's stuck in the middle.

140
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,160
They're not going to work.
I can tell you that.

141
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,080
These are going to be bad.

142
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,440
They're gonna be really BLEEP.

143
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
Because it's not been done properly,

144
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
and we don't have time
to make a new one.

145
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,880
Slav, captain of the luxury
chocolatier team, Our Chocolate,

146
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
is also struggling.

147
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,160
I'm a bit worried about this.

148
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,960
It seems a bit soft.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm gonna put in the fridge.

150
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,240
If the butter is allowed to melt
during each time-consuming turn,

151
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,480
the layers of dough will combine,
destroying any chance of lamination.

152
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,240
But Romain, head baker
of the Hotel Cafe Royal,

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,560
has a trick of the trade
up his sleeve.

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,480
So, Romain has just put the
laminated dough in the freezer.

155
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
I would do 15 minutes.

156
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,800
For their Viennoiserie creation,

157
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,640
Emmanuel and Sam of the five-star
Hilton Park Lane

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,640
have a trick of their own.

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
OK, so what are you doing, Sam?

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
A crioche. A crioche.

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,360
Yeah - it's a cookie, brioche,
smashed together. Ooh!

162
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,880
Sam will combine vanilla brioche
with pecan cookie dough

163
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,400
and fill his invention with
caramelised apple

164
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
and a Calvados mousseline.

165
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,360
So, Calvados mousseline,
caramelised apple,

166
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,760
cookie... And the brioche.
And pecan?

167
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
And brioche. Mm.

168
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,440
HE WHISTLES

169
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
A lot going on, guys, huh?

170
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
You said crazy. Crazy, I want.

171
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Darryl and Barrett of Birmingham's
Resorts World

172
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
have gone crazy with colour.

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,880
I'm making a pink Danish,

174
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
trying to go a bit in touch

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,480
with my feminine side.

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
His pink Danish pastry cases
will be filled

177
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,120
with white chocolate

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
creme patissiere, raspberry gel,

179
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,640
and a pistachio nut puree.

180
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
These are like vol-au-vents.

181
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,200
That's right.
Those are before my time.

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
I suppose they were, like,
really hot in, like, the '80s.

183
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,720
Yeah - we're gonna revive them.

184
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,840
We'll have to wait and see.

185
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,320
You know what the judges are like.
They'll probably slate it.

186
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
But, you know.

187
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,000
When it comes to impressing
the judges,

188
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
one team will have an advantage.

189
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,720
Now, Romain, am I right in thinking,
you are head of baking?

190
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,840
Head baker. Head baker!

191
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,040
Like Cheryl Baker.

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,280
Head baker at Hotel Cafe Royal.

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,880
So, does that give you a head start
on everybody, do you think?

194
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
I'm more nervous than everyone.

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,920
Why? My head is on the line!

196
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,120
Romain has invented romantic
Danish pastry flowers

197
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
where spirals
of plain and pink pastry

198
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,600
filled with raspberry jam will sit

199
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,920
on a pistachio sable biscuit base.

200
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,080
Is that something
we've never seen before?

201
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
You've probably seen it before.

202
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,880
This shape, I'm sure you've seen.

203
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,280
He can't invent a new shape!

204
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
There's only so many shapes.

205
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,280
The shape of the Danish
is always kind of well known now,

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,920
but then it is not done with a
pistachio sable in the bottom.

207
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,760
We will see.
Have you been creative enough?

208
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,640
That's my question -
or have you been safe?

209
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
We will see.

210
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,040
Things are far from safe
with Hideko and Teo

211
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,280
from the independent bespoke
pastry business, Sweet Art Lab.

212
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,040
It may be breakfast time,
but they are already drinking.

213
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,760
You like a pina colada?
I love pina colada.

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,320
Their pina colada pastries

215
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,120
will see green, pineapple-shaped
brioche buns,

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
filled with pineapple compote

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
and a coconut and rum cream.

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
We are going to make brioche dough.

219
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,360
Laminate it like a croissant.

220
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,320
and then making
like a pineapple effect.

221
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,160
So, it's a pina colada brioche.

222
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
So, how do we shorten that?
Maybe to like a...Pinoche?

223
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,960
General Pinoche.

224
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,280
That's what you wanted, right?

225
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,880
A delicious, breakfast Pinoche.

226
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
I...I like it.

227
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
You sure?

228
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
Pinoche. Me too.

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,840
Now, I am giving the second fold
to my dough.

230
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,280
Two folds in and the Savoy's
croissant dough...

231
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
BLEEP

232
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,040
..doesn't seem to be improving.

233
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
Eddie's trying to recover the
mistake that I made.

234
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
I'm not confident at all with it.

235
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,520
Cos BLEEP. BLEEP.

236
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
For BLEEP sake.

237
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,800
Throughout the competition,

238
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
chocolatiers Slav and Maria

239
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,680
have impressed with their signature
ingredient -

240
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,800
but, for romance week,

241
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,160
they have turned their back
on their first love.

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
Are you going to incorporate
some kind of chocolate

243
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
into any of your creation?

244
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,440
Not today.

245
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,280
I can't believe you!
On the next challenge.

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
You have always made chocolate.

247
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,200
We like to have a break from
chocolate this day.

248
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,080
Their chocolate-free walnut nest

249
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
will see the brioche dough

250
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
swirled around

251
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:18,720
a lemon and walnut meringue.

252
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,280
Sounds nice -
but is that very creative?

253
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
A lemon swirl?

254
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,120
For me, it is.

255
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,520
So, now it's the last fold I give to
my dough.

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,920
After that, I will leave it to rest
for a little bit

257
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
and roll out in shape.

258
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
Looking great. Looking good.

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
So, the croissant, I think I might
have fixed it, I don't know.

260
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
Fingers crossed.

261
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,200
I'm making the
Viennoiserie creation.

262
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
Make sure it's even.

263
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,160
The judges have demanded batches
of Viennoiserie

264
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
that are absolutely identical.

265
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,800
Make sure they're lined up,
and they're stuck.

266
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
They have to be stuck.

267
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,400
Just piping the choux
in the middle of the brioche,

268
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
and then we're going put the
craquelin on top,

269
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,040
and then we're going to
prove it again.

270
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,640
So, now I'm shaping the croissant.

271
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,720
After this, they will
be ready to go in the prover.

272
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,560
It's actually going pretty well.

273
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,800
I do a triangle,
and then just roll it.

274
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,520
Easy as that.

275
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
Romain's experience...

276
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,840
I'm quite happy with what
we've got today.

277
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
..sees both of his Viennoiserie
first into the prover -

278
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,800
while the rest of the teams
struggle.

279
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,320
Can I cut, or are you OK? I'm OK.

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
Half of 9's 4.5, isn't it?

281
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,520
A small difference now make a
massive difference at the end.

282
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,640
The thicker they are now,

283
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,120
the more they are going to prove

284
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,400
and the more good they are going
to be afterwards.

285
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,200
Considering the mess
I put us into, they're looking OK.

286
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
This is taking time.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,640
I'm so happy I'm with you!

288
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
Let's see - it's not proved yet.

289
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,960
Chefs, you are halfway through your
Viennoiserie challenge.

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,440
Why aren't we just saying
breakfast pastries?

291
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
You can. Chefs, you are halfway
through your breakfast pastries.

292
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,240
Whilst the Viennoiserie creations
are ready for the oven...

293
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
..croissants should be left to prove
for at least an hour.

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,800
There's loads of, like,
hanging around, isn't there?

295
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,600
If it overproves or underproves, I
mean, you can't really do too much.

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
It's one chance, one chance only.

297
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,160
Bro, you should do some voice-over
for films or something.

298
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
The conviction in your eyes
when you say,

299
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
"One chance and one chance only."

300
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Yeah.

301
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,920
Waiting.

302
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
Just waiting.

303
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,560
For the first time in the
competition,

304
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
there is nothing for the
teams to do.

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Yeah.

306
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,600
I BLEEP hate this.

307
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
Chefs, you have half an hour left -
that's half an hour.

308
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,240
Now there is a trade-off to be made.

309
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,720
Every minute in the prover...

310
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,400
Still a little bit more time
to prove.

311
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,840
..means less time in the oven...

312
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,040
You need to bake it.
Yeah. You need to bake it.

313
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,040
Yeah. let's time.

314
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,960
..but the longer they hold
their nerve...

315
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,440
..the less they risk heavy,
doughy croissants.

316
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,000
We'll give the croissants five
minutes and then we'll pop them in.

317
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,160
Aiming for 15 to 20 minutes.

318
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,480
They're chilled and ready.

319
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,360
Go on.

320
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Put it in.

321
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
What time is it? 34.

322
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
Let's put them in now.

323
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,880
There's nothing we can do with them.

324
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,120
That's it. They come out good,
they come good.

325
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,920
They come out bad,
they come out bad.

326
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,400
They're spitting butter.

327
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,160
Chefs, you've got 15 minutes left.

328
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
15 minutes left.

329
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,560
These ones I'm quite happy with
at the minute.

330
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,040
Go for it. Close it.

331
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
It's going to be like a tear
and share brioche and cookie.

332
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,960
It's not exactly what I want,
but it could have been worse.

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,120
It's good.

334
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,120
How long do we have left?

335
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,720
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

336
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,040
My croissants haven't
really gone to plan.

337
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,160
Take them out.

338
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
Are they ready?
How are they looking?

339
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,760
Yeah, they're ready.

340
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,480
The croissants are almost ready.

341
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,240
Chefs, you have one minute left.

342
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,640
Come on.

343
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
It's all right, I would say.

344
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,000
Chefs, your time is up.
Your time is up.

345
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
They're not good.

346
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,800
Home time, I think.

347
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,280
Romain's is the best.

348
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,240
Are you happy? I'm happy.

349
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
I'm happy you're happy!

350
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,280
Oh, my God!

351
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,440
It's judgment time for the teams'
viennoiserie.

352
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
Emmanuel and Sam,
please come forward.

353
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:01,160
OPERA MUSIC

354
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,960
You can see that they are actually
quite inconsistent.

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,120
This is quite disappointing.

356
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,200
It doesn't look good. It doesn't
have the honeycomb that we were
looking for.

357
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,000
It's a work in progress, that's all
I can say,

358
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,680
but it's not where it should be.
What about your viennoiserie
creation?

359
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,840
I like the idea of the cookie and
the brioche dough, but the
execution,

360
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,840
you can't just throw things together
and expect it to work.

361
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,280
I quite like the apple with the
Calvados and the

362
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
pastry cream, however,

363
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,800
that's about all that I can say in
the positive side.

364
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,320
This is one of your worst
challenges.

365
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,080
You guys can do better.

366
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,560
For me, there is not enough work
here.

367
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
WHISPERS: Harsh!

368
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,080
It's very tough.

369
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,280
It's all over the shop.
Little ones, big ones.

370
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,880
Some look kind of a croissant and
some looks like absolutely nothing.

371
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
I think it's undercooked a little
bit.

372
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,080
You think it's undercooked a LITTLE
bit?

373
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,160
I am not eating viennoiserie which
is not baked.

374
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
So this is a walnut nest.

375
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
It's a bit of a simple design,

376
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,000
and they look fairly dense and if
there is one thing you don't want is

377
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,920
to feel heavy after you have had
your breakfast.

378
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,160
Can you remind us what is this
inside here?

379
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
Meringue with lemon and walnuts.

380
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,560
What we can say is that viennoiserie
is not your thing.

381
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,040
There's some lamination that I can
see,

382
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
but I can see it is very irregular.

383
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,680
It is baked, but...

384
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,280
too tight. Creations,
presentation-wise, red,

385
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
a lot of red.
Colouring, guys, with moderation.

386
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
It's so dry when I eat it.

387
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,640
I don't enjoy eating the pastry at
all.

388
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,640
Um. It is so heavy.

389
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,920
We asked for flaky, buttery,
identical.

390
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,800
I have to cross all the boxes.

391
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
Maybe you got better luck with your
creation.

392
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,720
I like the idea. Do I like the
execution?

393
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,400
No.

394
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,640
The flavour of the pineapple is
present.

395
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,360
It doesn't taste as bad as it looks.

396
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,360
Is that a compliment?
Yes! Thank you!

397
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,880
I fear that they are not going to
text not going to taste great. No.

398
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,440
No? Well...

399
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,240
Well, it is what...
It is what it is.

400
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,160
It is what it is. It's very heavy.
It's very tight.

401
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,960
There's absolutely no flakiness
whatsoever.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
I'm not going to taste it because
it's uncooked.

403
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
And your briolles.

404
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
You've taken the challenge as it
should be.

405
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,680
You have combined two different
things to make one.

406
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,680
Interesting. Is that what you were
trying to achieve?

407
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,240
Yes. OK.

408
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,120
The flavour combination of the two,
it's actually pleasant.

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
I enjoy eating it.

410
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,840
In terms of the flavour, in terms of
the nuts that you put on top.

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,600
Choux pastry and the brioche.
Ooh! Interesting.

412
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,240
I think you did very well.
Very proud of you, well done.

413
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,320
Yeah, thank you very much. See you
later.

414
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
There isn't a shadow of a doubt
these are the best croissants today.

415
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,200
They are flaky, they are baked
correctly.

416
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
They look like they have expanded,
so therefore they were proved.

417
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,080
Talk to me, Romain.
It's not the best I have done.

418
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,400
It can be lighter and the honeycomb
texture needs to expand a bit more.

419
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,600
Having said that, I think we have
the beginning of what should be
great.

420
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
Let me crack it.
Oh, my goodness! Can you hear that?

421
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,400
They are at the best croissants
today.

422
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,040
Your viennoiserie creations.

423
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,360
A flower pattern, which has got a
pistachio sweet paste at the bottom.

424
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,920
We've filled it with a raspberry jam
and then also a pistachio paste.

425
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
You remind me of Madonna.

426
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,680
THEY LAUGH

427
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,160
Madonna would be so happy with you.

428
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,960
Especially created for her.

429
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,240
I really like the flavour of the
raspberry.

430
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
I really do. That makes it work, so
your reputation is safe for now.

431
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,680
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

432
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,200
For once, we nailed the first
challenge, so,

433
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
yeah... We served something, that's
the main thing.

434
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,200
We served 24 croissants.

435
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,320
There were terrible, but we served
24. Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,280
What can you do?

437
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,120
Sometimes life is hard, you have to
get on with it.

438
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,240
The teams now have a golden hour to
prepare any elements that need
setting

439
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,520
for tomorrow's all sugar showpiece.

440
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,400
The teams have to do really well
tomorrow because they are fighting
for a

441
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,560
place in the quarterfinal.
So who's really impressed today?

442
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,800
There is no shadow of a doubt,

443
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,920
Hotel Cafe Royale delivered a
beautiful set of viennoiserie.

444
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,080
Yeah, he was so focused.
I can see the fire is in his eyes.

445
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:06,160
Hilton Park Lane, they've been
really good throughout the heats,

446
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,240
but now it's come to the final six,
so far, they haven't really
delivered.

447
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,520
This is one of the worst
performances they put on the table
today.

448
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,400
R Chocolate, really concerned.

449
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:17,400
Tomorrow is sugar work and they are
called R Chocolate.

450
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,280
Let's hope they have worked on sugar
work because that could be a killer

451
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,040
blow for them. The showpiece
challenge.

452
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:25,280
This week it's themed around
romance.

453
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:27,560
What are you expecting to see from
the teams, then?

454
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,400
When we think romance, we think
about Valentine, we think about
roses,

455
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,240
we think about diamonds.

456
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,040
I think about Grindr, but carry on.
How does that come together?

457
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,200
I'll tell you about it after this,
Cherish,

458
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:44,320
I don't think we've got time to
explain Grindr in the middle of a
cake competition.

459
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,360
OPERA MUSIC

460
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,640
DOG WHINES

461
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,800
Game face on.

462
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:00,480
Good morning, chefs. It's showpiece
time!

463
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,640
And that's not the first romantic
setting I've ever said that in.

464
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:08,440
This is your last chance to impress
the judges to win a place in next

465
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,960
week's quarterfinal.

466
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,960
We would like you to make a
beautiful sugar showpiece.

467
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,400
Make your structure innovative and
technically flawless, but don't
forget,

468
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,520
this is romance week, so we want to
see passion in your design.

469
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,720
Your showpiece must include 30
pulled sugar sweets and 30 designer

470
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,360
marzipan to make our heart go boom,
boom, boom.

471
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,120
You have four hours remaining to
complete today's challenge and your
time starts now.

472
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,840
Good luck. Good luck.

473
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,600
This is the competition's first-ever
all sugar showpiece challenge.

474
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,160
Just bring it back here to 160.

475
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,560
And the teams must construct a
stunning centrepiece at least 70

476
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
centimetres tall. What can go wrong
with sugar?

477
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,440
Well, the first, obvious, it can
break.

478
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,920
If it's not standing up still it
will collapse, but when it
collapses,

479
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,400
it shatters.

480
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,840
We expect to see beautiful pulled
sugar, blown sugar, cast sugar and,

481
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,280
of course, the confectionery has to
be exquisite.

482
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,040
We are asking more than ever.

483
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,360
# It must be love, love, love... #

484
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,640
That is hot. After a heartbreaking
challenge yesterday,

485
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Emmanuel and Sam are now hoping to
patch things up with more than just

486
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,520
the power of love. The showpiece is
romantic,

487
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,680
but it's more with an exotic touch.

488
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,200
The flower is exotic, an exotic bird
of paradise, but that's what we
need,

489
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,160
you know? A bit of romance, a bit of
sun.

490
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,320
Beneath a poured sugar tree
decorated in pulled sugar flowers
and a blown

491
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,760
sugar bird, will sit hazelnut
praline pulled sugar sweets and
apricot

492
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,160
flavoured marzipan roses.

493
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,360
And a team's chances of reaching the
quarterfinals may have been given a
much-needed boost.

494
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,040
I want to show as many sugar skills
as possible,

495
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,360
so I must have about seven or eight
techniques all going on.

496
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,880
Just ten months ago, Sam came second
in the UK sugar championships.

497
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,120
Pressure and adrenaline has to kick
in,

498
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,120
especially when you're standing in
front of a sugar lump that's melting
you to pieces.

499
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,920
But Sam isn't the only sugar expert
in the room.

500
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
Eddie from the Savoy was a finalist
in the junior category of the same
competition.

501
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,760
So, we've got a nice way wavy shape
and are blown heart is going to come

502
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,720
from the back around to the front
and then love is everywhere.

503
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,480
Love Is Everywhere, is that the name
of the centrepiece?

504
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,520
It is now! Eddie's moulded sugar
stem will support a giant blown
sugar

505
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,640
heart that will provide the backdrop
for salted peanut praline sweets and

506
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,000
cherry-shaped marzipans with
pistachio stones.

507
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,640
That cherry, does it have anything
to link with the showpiece,
because it's romance?

508
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,640
You know, when you go for a romantic
picnic, you feed each other
cherries?

509
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,480
We thought, you know, strawberries
are too common. We wanted to do
something different.

510
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,960
So you have spares, right?

511
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,440
We do, yes. Can I?
No.

512
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
While Eddie and Sam are at
championship level...

513
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,680
This is like some sort of beautiful
heart or maybe a...

514
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,680
It's not a heart. I'm just
working... Maybe a liver? It could
be a liver?

515
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,600
..this is the first time Maria and
Slav have worked solely with sugar.

516
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,680
We are doing romance in Paris.
We've done hearts.

517
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
You can see it here. Oh! Oh!

518
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,240
Slav's hearts will be wrapped in
tricolour sugar ribbons and his

519
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,720
homage to the romance of Paris will
see two blown sugar lovebirds
embrace

520
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,000
over orange and pistachio marzipan
flowers

521
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,960
and sweets filled with hazelnut
praline.

522
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,080
May I ask, are you single
at the moment?

523
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,640
I am single at the moment. At the
moment.

524
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,000
May I ask, Maria, are you single at
the moment or are you..?

525
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,880
I am single at the moment, as well.
Oh! Do you think you guys could get
together maybe?

526
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,000
We don't have time at the moment at
all.

527
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,840
What is, "I love you," in Hungarian?

528
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,280
Szeretlek. Szeretlek.
And what is it in Macedonian?

529
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,800
Te sakam. Te sakam.

530
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,400
OK, I haven't heard that yet before!

531
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,520
Well, maybe you'll hear it again one
day. Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

532
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,240
Bye! Bye! Bye!

533
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,920
VOICEOVER: Slav and Maria aren't the
only ones headed to the city of
lovers.

534
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,480
So, it's a French romance.
Yes, it's a French romance.

535
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,240
Parisian. Parisian.

536
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,920
The main part is a heart and some
ribbons,

537
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,240
the red and the blue and the white
colour.

538
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,920
The French flag. Oh, I see what
you're doing there, Theo,

539
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,480
I see what you're doing.

540
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,480
Their Parisian affair will be
completed with blue and white blown

541
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,640
sugar lovebirds, sweets filled with
a chocolate and hazelnut praline

542
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,480
and, for the morning after, poppy
seed,

543
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,240
mango and passion fruit marzipans
in the slightly less romantic form

544
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,200
of egg on toast. You know, after a
nice night...

545
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,480
Ooh, la, la, la, la! You want
breakfast in the bed, yeah?

546
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,040
You mean just the two of us?

547
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,920
Breakfast romance. What's your
choice? Ah, so all of us.

548
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,800
Romantic gestures at the Hotel Cafe
Royal seem to be a little more
refined.

549
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,760
Our showpiece is going to have
flowers, hearts, champagne glasses,

550
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,680
strawberries. You know, the usual.

551
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,840
They are the only team attempting a
two-tiered showpiece where an ornate

552
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,920
18-piece three-dimensional display
stand will support their champagne

553
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
and heart-themed sugar sculpture.

554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,360
It will be filled with hazelnut
praline sweets and marzipan

555
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,080
strawberries flavoured with
pistachio and rose.

556
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,200
I'm must try to understand why you
have chosen rose to flavour a

557
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,880
strawberry. Because we have roses on
our showpiece.

558
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
The man has answers for you today!

559
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,120
I think about everything.

560
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,840
Romain, you are on it.

561
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,520
Love is your thing.

562
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,680
It is. Could there be romance for
Romain?

563
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
Romain romance.

564
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,600
Lyrics. Oh, yes.

565
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,680
Oh, yes. Whilst Romain has thought
of everything...

566
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,280
We'll do swans...

567
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,160
Well, they might be ducks.

568
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,640
See how they turn out.

569
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,840
..Darryl and Bharat's romantic plans
have yet to be

570
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,280
fully firmed up.

571
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,680
They're going to sit on top of the
love heart.

572
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,680
Like me and my wife, actually.

573
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,360
Um...
I'll get Brownie points for that.

574
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,760
Below a giant moulded sugar heart
and two as yet unnamed birds,

575
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,640
will sit hazelnut pralines sweets
and heart-shaped strawberry and

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,880
orange marzipans. I'm confident
there's going to be two swans,
maybe.

577
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,560
Chefs, you are halfway through your
romantic challenge.

578
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,080
I'm blowing a sugar heart.

579
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,440
Temperature is everything. To
successfully blow and shape molten
sugar,

580
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,600
the chefs must walk a temperature
tightrope.

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
Using heat lamps,

582
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,160
they need to constantly ensure the
sugar is hot enough to manipulate.

583
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
Whoops! It went so far.

584
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,960
And the moment they have a shape
they're happy with...

585
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,360
That's good.

586
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,800
..using a fan, they need to gently
cool the sugar until it sets.

587
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,080
So I have blown the swan, as I want
the neck to start to set,

588
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,320
I keep blowing the body.

589
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,880
Heat or cool too much, or even
slightly too quickly,

590
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,400
and their carefully crafted forms
will shatter.

591
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,280
It might survive, but I'm not sure
because I need to cool down.

592
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,120
But whilst most teams are blowing
smaller decorative items...

593
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,240
That's one down. ..Eddie's entire
showpiece is built around a giant

594
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,160
heart made with two huge blown
halves.

595
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,280
BLEEP!

596
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,240
It's a bit cold. It could be hotter.

597
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,080
Another 10 degrees and we'll be
fine.

598
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,440
Does it look like a bird? Now I've
BLEEP this up.

599
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,520
I'm going to start this again.

600
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,280
It's just the temperatures were off.
It's not consistent in here.

601
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,000
Yeah, I think that'll do.

602
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,560
It's always nice to finish a job the
way you wanted to.

603
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,280
Eddie is now in danger of not
finishing at all...

604
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,240
BLEEP! BLEEP!

605
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,000
I'll start again.

606
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,800
..leaving his romantic showpiece...

607
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,480
BLEEP! The paper's on fire.
..without a heart.

608
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,960
90 minutes left to secure a place in
the quarterfinals.

609
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,600
The paper caught on the blowtorch.

610
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,440
And with other showpiece elements
still to construct...

611
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,080
I'm reasonably happy. ..Eddie's
heart is slowing him down.

612
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,040
It's half a heart shape.

613
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,240
As well as a stunning sugar
showpiece,

614
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,920
the judges have demanded 30...

615
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,880
Three, four, five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten...

616
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,480
..exquisite marzipans that look
as good as they taste.

617
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,760
I'm making the bow for the suit.

618
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,680
With the blowtorch, they really look
like a slice of bread.

619
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,800
Is egg on toast a very romantic meal
for you?

620
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,040
This is after the wild night,
it's the lovely breakfast.

621
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,080
Wow, after a wild night you like to
make someone egg on toast?!

622
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,760
That's it! And get into the bed!

623
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,560
Their 30 romantic marzipans must be
escorted by 30 more pulled praline

624
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,040
sweets. So we've got two sugar,
one silver, one gold.

625
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,040
Pipe some praline.

626
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,080
We've gone for a salted peanut
flavour. Everybody loves a peanut.

627
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,040
What could go wrong? Sometimes when
you fold it,

628
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,560
it's just leaking everywhere.

629
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,720
The tricky part...

630
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,720
Grr. I don't even know
what's coming out.

631
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,880
We've got to make sure these are
sealed properly,

632
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,320
and then when it comes to rolling,
you've got to be fast.

633
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,960
If the sugar becomes too cool...
BLEEP.

634
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,680
..it will be too brittle to pour.

635
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
That's cooled down too fast.

636
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,680
Ruining any chance of delivering the
thin,

637
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,600
crisp shell the judges will be
looking for.

638
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,760
The temperature's off. We're going
to start again.

639
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,560
You want that crunch and snap,
though. Don't want something where

640
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,640
you're going to break your teeth
when you eat it.

641
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,920
But pulled too thin,

642
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,200
and the praline filling may not stay
in the centre of the sweet.

643
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,560
This one is very, very difficult.

644
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,920
I'm super happy with this. I mean,
there was the harder part of my job.

645
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,280
Yeah, I can see some here.

646
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,760
Chefs, love is in the air for one
more hour.

647
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,080
We're going to be a little bit in
the BLEEP if we don't move.

648
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,000
We need to crack on, big-time.

649
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,080
We have to assemble, so definitely
going to be tight on time.

650
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,480
In order to build their showpiece,

651
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,040
the teams will now have to
reintroduce potentially lethal
heat...

652
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,120
We're doomed.
..and rapid cooling...

653
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,520
..to their delicately constructed
sugar elements.

654
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,320
Yeah, that's nice and straight.
Wait, no, no, no. BLEEP.

655
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680
We've got time. Stick it on!

656
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,880
It's fine.

657
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
Nice one.

658
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
You said it was straight.

659
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,600
It looks... If you look at it from
here.

660
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,960
Maybe the flower here, the bird on
the top.

661
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,080
BLEEP. Maybe a bit more. Yeah.

662
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,320
Oh, don't touch, if it splits...

663
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,160
It's a bit fragile, no?
Yeah, it's very fragile.

664
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,640
I put it in the microwave.
No way. I'll do it.

665
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,760
It's not straight at all.

666
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,360
Yeah, because it's now turning.

667
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,360
Just hold on a minute.

668
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,760
Cos I was lifting that.

669
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,280
Challenge. The fourth one I've done
today.

670
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,120
Chefs, you've got ten minutes
left now.

671
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,400
Ten minutes. Watch out for my hair.

672
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,720
Yeah. I want to get this on the
table.

673
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,440
Oh, God.

674
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,600
Bring the polystyrene closer.

675
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
Don't like this at all.

676
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,080
It is leaning, isn't it?

677
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,440
Well, the Tower of Pisa leaned.

678
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,160
It's still up. Put it on the top.

679
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,840
It's going to break. Yeah.

680
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,000
Can't fit on top. Put it there.

681
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,080
You know, forget about the heart
in the middle.

682
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
Forget about that.

683
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,280
Just give me loads of glue.

684
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,960
No, it's not going to hold on.

685
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,480
Just give me the glue. Just stick it
on that, it's fine.

686
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,880
It's either this or nothing.

687
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
What about this one?

688
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,160
Don't bloody rush it
for the sake of it.

689
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,440
We need something to lean it on.

690
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
Do you know what? A jar.

691
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,840
Chefs, you have one minute left.

692
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,440
That's one minute.

693
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,480
I think that looks good.
Yeah, it's good.

694
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,360
This is too hot. It's melting the
stems.

695
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,640
Have you got all the sweets on?

696
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,080
Right, let's move - hold the rest of
it at the bottom of that.

697
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,560
This freaks me out, every
time I look at it.

698
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,920
It's not moving, though, is it?

699
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,080
Otherwise it would have fallen by
now.

700
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,960
Oh, no!

701
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,080
My days.

702
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,680
Why did that happen to them?

703
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Oh no.

704
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,560
Time is up.

705
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,880
Time for a sit.

706
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,240
Five stunning romantic showpieces

707
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,000
and one devastating break-up

708
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,960
will now be judged by Cherish
and Benoit.

709
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,960
You put a lot of technique into
one sugar showpiece which is really

710
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,880
well done. The flower is
really attractive.

711
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,760
It is the centre of attention.

712
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,240
This ribbon is beautiful.

713
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,640
Lovely curves.

714
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,960
So well done. Your yellow roses,
tell us what's in it?

715
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
Almond marzipan with apricot.

716
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
I have to say, they look pretty.

717
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,240
Marzipan is really moist and
it's really nice.

718
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,080
If you could have put a little bit
more apricot in it I would have
enjoyed it more.

719
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,800
Yeah. Pulled sugar sweet,
there is a good elegance to it.

720
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,640
Flavour-wise, the pollen is lovely.

721
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,000
Benoit says it all. I think
the sugar is a little bit thicker,

722
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,000
however, I like the gold in between.

723
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Thank you. Thanks, chefs.

724
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
That was all right.

725
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,880
The piece is tilting towards
the back but I think it's elegant.

726
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,040
You did very well, however,

727
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,520
at the moment it's just piling up
and I cannot see the beauty of the

728
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,760
confectionery that you present us.

729
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,000
So this the strawberry and orange
marzipan with an orange confit

730
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
in the centre.

731
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,720
The marzipan is not too greasy
and I've got your orange flavour.

732
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,400
I could not taste strawberry at all,
but I don't like the confit.

733
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,960
Your pulled sugar sweet.

734
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,320
I do taste the praline that you put
in the centre.

735
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,640
I've got the crunchiness
in the middle.

736
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,520
You are going in the right
direction.

737
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,920
Slide the jar to the side and see.

738
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,760
HE EXHALES RAPIDLY

739
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,360
You look already happier. I am.

740
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,960
There's always a story when I look
at your showpiece. I know it's

741
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,840
romance, I know that it is
Valentine, I know that it's love.

742
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,640
That coupe is beautiful.

743
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,080
This sitting on that would have been
top notch.

744
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,200
It's a rose, strawberry
with a pistachio top.

745
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,160
It looks quite nice with those
little tuxedo jackets.

746
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,320
The rose kicks in slowly,

747
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,640
so it's not overpowering like
you're eating a bar of soap.

748
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
Sugar sweet.

749
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,960
So for me the praline is
absolutely lovely.

750
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,480
Perfectly roasted, I got the
hazelnut, it's full of fragrance.

751
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,680
Thank you very much.
BOTH: Thank you.

752
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,320
Are you happy with that? Yeah.

753
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,080
Your heart shape, well,
it's a basic shape,

754
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,120
so how do we manage to not
get it very neat and tidy?

755
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,280
That I don't know, and as far as the
blown sugar, the shape is all wrong.

756
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,320
For me, it's the beak. You pinch
the beak between your finger flat.

757
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,360
This is not a swan. This is more of
a Daffy Duck kind of beak, yes.

758
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,720
Orange marzipan on the bottom.

759
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,280
On the top, pistachio.

760
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,240
When I look at it I think
there's not much work put into it.

761
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,720
The taste of orange
is quite pleasant.

762
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,200
Having said that, it takes
over everything else.

763
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,960
I've got enough flavour, I know it's
a praline but I think not enough.

764
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,400
I guess I'm the unlucky one,
I don't see any sort of filling.

765
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,320
Oh. I think it's my fault.

766
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,680
No, come on. Warm it up too much,
and didn't cool enough.

767
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,440
I quite like it. You stand up very
proudly and you say "This is me,

768
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,920
"I did it," and not many people
would do that.

769
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,440
The last 20 minutes of the challenge
you keep on adding so the base where

770
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,560
your heart was actually standing
wasn't completely cooled,

771
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,160
so keep on moving, keep on moving
and eventually - boom.

772
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,160
Could you please take us
to your marzipan.

773
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,680
It's a passion fruit.

774
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,120
What is the toast made from?

775
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,920
Almond with poppy seed.

776
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,760
You guys always come up with funky
design and this is a cracker.

777
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
I love this.

778
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,320
The passion fruit with that little
confit you have got inside

779
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,880
is just stunning. Well done.

780
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,520
Sugar sweet.

781
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,240
Really like the way
you twist your pulled sugar.

782
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
Can you find any praline in there?

783
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,440
There is a taste of the praline
and it is actually quite nice.

784
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,000
I think I've been the unlucky one,
I could not find any praline in it.

785
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,160
I was so looking forward to eating
these because they look so pretty.

786
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,920
Thank you, chefs. Thank you.

787
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,240
WHISPERED: Make a sandwich.
Make a sandwich.

788
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,080
Oh, the yolk's gone down my shirt!

789
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
Well done. Well done.

790
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
You did a couple of techniques,

791
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,000
however, I think
it's really poorly executed.

792
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,200
You're trying to do too much.
Your thought process is,

793
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,000
"I'm going to do something
extremely complicated",

794
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,360
but for that instance
you can't pull it off.

795
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,560
Your marzipan.

796
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,920
So, sour cherry marzipan.

797
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
And inside it has
a pistachio marzipan.

798
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,800
It has a little chocolate stem as
well.

799
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,320
Oh, tra-la-la. Today was not the day
to temper chocolate in here.

800
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,600
Every time we come in,
there is excuses.

801
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
Let's taste.

802
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,280
My brain is asking me to eat cherry,

803
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,160
but my taste bud is not asking me
that there is cherry in there.

804
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,560
OK.

805
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,000
As for the praline, do you see any?

806
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,360
No. I'm struggling.

807
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,040
Me too. I can lick a little bit.

808
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,040
It's a shame,
with struggling so much

809
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,600
to find a salted peanut brownie,

810
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,040
because when I had it, finally it
was beautiful.

811
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
Thank you very much.

812
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,320
I'm sorry. You can taste cherry in
there.

813
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,280
I don't care what they say,
you can taste cherry.

814
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,120
Anyway, pack your bags,
we're going home.

815
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,440
Based on today's showpiece,
and yesterday's miniatures,

816
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,480
Cherish and Benoit must now rank
the teams,

817
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,360
and those in last place will be
leaving the competition.

818
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,920
We think we are out from now.

819
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,240
You stick everything together
at the last minute,

820
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,400
nothing has time to cool down
correctly.

821
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,880
I am not looking forward to go to
the next challenge, I think.

822
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,880
Probably we are going to leave
the competition.

823
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,720
We'll accept our fate,
what's done is done,

824
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,600
but I don't think
we did our best today.

825
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,000
We have a lot more to give.
I know we do.

826
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,280
The team in first place absolutely
blew the competition

827
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,520
out of the water with their
Viennoiserie,

828
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,160
congratulations,
Leanne and Romain,

829
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,800
from Hotel Cafe Royal, you are
through to the quarterfinal.

830
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:47,040
Emmanuel and Sam are in second, and
joining them in the quarterfinals

831
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,200
are Darryl and Bharat in third.

832
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,720
In fourth place we have...

833
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
Eddie and Mahshid from the Savoy.

834
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,440
Which leaves Hideko and Theo
from Sweet Art Lab,

835
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,680
and Slav and Maria from R Chocolate.

836
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,320
After much deliberation,

837
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,640
the judges decided that the team
leaving us tonight are...

838
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,800
Slav and Maria from R Chocolate.

839
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,760
Sorry to see you go.

840
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,400
Congratulations to the rest of you,

841
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
and we look forward to seeing you
next week.

842
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,920
You've made me smile a lot. Yeah.

843
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
I am very proud of what we
have achieved.

844
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,320
We didn't each expect to go
that much far.

845
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,320
It's sad to go, but I think it has
been amazing,

846
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,640
and to quote the song, "What doesn't
kill you makes you stronger."

847
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,920
So... Of course.

848
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,960
HIDEKO: I can't believe it!

849
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,240
We survived again!

850
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,320
Very happy. Well done.

851
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,560
If we go out in the quarterfinals
let's go out with a bang,

852
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,040
whether it's the showpiece falling
down or we make something horrible,

853
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,840
let's just go out with a bang.

854
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,040
Next time - the quarterfinals.

855
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,240
Getting so close now.

856
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,960
A towering tiered macaron cake...

857
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,560
Hope it doesn't collapse.

858
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,080
..and a fantastical fairy tale
showpiece...

859
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,560
You believe in fairies, Cherish?

860
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,080
Yes, of course I believe in fairy.

861
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,000
..means one team's dream... BLEEP

862
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,880
..will become a nightmare.
What's cracking?

863
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,480
Oh come on, man!

864
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:43,640

﻿1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,280
Welcome back to Bake Off: The
Professionals, where just five teams
remain, battling for the four spaces

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,960
in next week's semifinal.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,280
And not only that - this week, our
theme is childhood,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
so our chefs will be taking us back
to the simpler times of our infancy.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,280
Remember childhood, Liam? Course I
do. I'm pretty much a kid now, bro.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,160
HE CHUCKLES
Playing Hide and Seek.
Playing Fifa.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
Riding round on my little tricycle.
Whizzing around in heely shoes.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,560
Singing Ring a Ring O' Roses.
Watching High School Musical.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
Oh, God, I'm so old, Liam!
I'm so old!

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,240
You seem a little bit overtired.
I'm not tired, Liam!

11
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,880
Come on, let's just start the
challenge so you can have a nap, OK?

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,200
Yeah, I'd like that, thanks, Liam.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
Last time...

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,080
BLEEP. ..The love light dimmed in a
romantic sugarwork showpiece.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
Because I was BLEEP.
We were serving BLEEP.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,800
Absolute BLEEP.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Leanne and Romain's design and
flavours...

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
It's beautiful. Top-notch.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
..Proved to be a match made in
heaven.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
Ah!

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,480
While disaster struck... Sorry!

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,240
..Leaving Hideko and
Theo broken-hearted.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,920
But it was Slav and Maria who failed
to feel the love...

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,320
I'm not going to eat it because that
would break my teeth.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
Sorry to see you go.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,480
..and became the latest team to
leave the competition.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
You've made me smile a lot.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
I'm very proud of what we have
achieved.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,320
This time... Oh, it's cracking.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
..The quarterfinal...
Getting so close now.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
..takes the teams back to
childhood...

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,280
As long as it doesn't collapse.

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,520
..As a tiered macaron cake
that sparks a tantrum...

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
You do it, then. Jesus Christ.
BLEEP.

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,040
..and a fairy tale showpiece on
an enchanting scale...

36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,600
BLEEP. BLEEP.

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
..Leave them to face their fates.

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
I love this.

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,920
Which four teams will live happily
ever after?

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,560
I didn't enjoy eating it at all.
BLEEP.

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,880
And whose adventure is about
to end?

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,160
Argh!

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,560
Quarterfinal week.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
Of the 12 teams who started the
competition, just five remain.

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
Welcome back, chefs.

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,680
A place in the semifinals
really is within your grasp.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,440
Just two challenges away.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,360
Judges, what terrifyingly
nightmarish task

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,040
have you set for us today?

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,560
I would like you to make a macaron
cake, with at least two fillings,

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,920
inspired by flavours from your
childhood.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
You must serve a minimum of 24
people,

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,200
and feature at least two tiers.

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,440
Yeah, remember when you were a child
and you had to make that two-tier

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,120
macaron display cake?
I think we did it in Cubs.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,560
And Cherish, what assignment would
you like to set?

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,480
I would like to have two different
types of sucettes,

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,200
all lollipop-shaped petit four.

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,600
18 of each, 36 in total.

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,840
Good luck, chefs. You are going to
need it.

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,920
You have 3.5 hours to complete
today's challenge,

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,520
and your time starts now.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,360
Now we're in the quarterfinals,
obviously, the pressure starts to
build.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,560
Me and Emmanuel both thrive under
pressure, so we should be all right.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
Childhood Week
won't be all fun and games.

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,640
Today's the day when we have the
most ever to do.

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,000
Not only must the quarterfinalists
manage their time properly,

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
it's crucial they deliver on the
flavours

69
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
and stories of their childhood.

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,880
We've asked them to do a macaron
cake because a macaron is already

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,320
tricky enough to do, but at this
stage of the competition,

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,240
in the quarterfinal, we want them to
do a larger version of that.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,120
What could go wrong is use the wrong
technique of piping your macaron.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,960
The little trick is not to
pipe a shell,

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
but to pipe the macaron in a spiral
motion

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,240
and make it easy to cut and to
bake.

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,800
If it's not baked correctly,

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,000
it will crack and it's not going to
be very pretty or appetising.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
Made by folding ground almonds and
icing sugar into whipped egg whites,

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,880
the macaron has been a staple of
French patisserie since the 16th
century...

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,960
Something we are used to
eating quite often.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
It's like croissant, basically.

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,800
..giving our cousins from across the
Channel a slight advantage.

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,960
We do make a lot of them, but they
tend to be petit four size.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,600
We rarely made a large 24 pieces,
so, yes,

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,600
it's going to be a bit challenging.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
Paying tribute to Emmanuel's rural
French upbringing,

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,720
Hilton Park Lane's caramelised
banana

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
and white chocolate ganache cake

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,760
recalls flavours that inspired him
as a boy.

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
I had a friend who was coming from
an island.

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,400
His mother would have used a lot of
exotic fruit like banana,

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,480
which, from the village where I come
from, was not something we would use

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
a lot of at the time.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,240
Managing the consistency of their
mixture is crucial.

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,040
If it's not folded enough, the
macaron will be dense and uneven.

97
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
Too much, and it will collapse in
the oven.

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
They looks simple, but they are
quite a hard thing to make.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,880
I'm just banging it out as much as I
can so I get a nice smooth

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,120
consistency. You'll see it creates
that nice, like,

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
ribbon effect. It'll sit
on top of each other,

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,280
that's what I'm looking for.

103
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,400
We're going for quite an exotic
macaron flavour today.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
Inside we're going to have a very,
like, citrusy curd.

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,360
Along with the Savoy's curd,
a grapefruit and blood orange jelly

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,640
will sit inside a cake that's
inspired

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,440
by Mahshid's upbringing in Iran.

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,320
Citrus, nuts, we eat a lot of fruit
in Iran.

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,800
This challenge is great, so I can
incorporate everything

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
from my childhood into this
challenge.

111
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
Hopefully, the judges will like
them.

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,640
While everyone is looking to their
formative years for inspiration,

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,760
Childhood Week plays into the hands
of one team in particular.

114
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,120
Hideko and Theo! Hello,
hello, hello, hello! Hello!

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,200
Your theme is often very
childlike.

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
Well, this week the theme is
actually childhood,

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,080
so are you going to do something
very adult,

118
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
maybe like a mortgage application or
something?

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
This is your chance to shine.

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,840
Sweet Art Lab's chances will rest on
a cake

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,480
inspired by Theo's childhood in
Marseille.

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,280
Raspberry macarons will be separated
by layers of lychee and raspberry

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,680
cremeux and his
delicate hibiscus jelly.

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,240
As a child, you had lychees and
hibiscus flowers?

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
To me, it sounds very sophisticated.

126
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,800
I was a sophisticated kid!

127
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,760
What springs to mind with Leanne and
Romain's cake, however,

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
is less sophistication and
more snackette.

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,040
We're doing my favourite childhood
peanut bar.

130
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,440
It is very nutty,

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,680
so if you like peanuts you're going
to like it and if you don't,

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,880
you probably won't.
We are happy with the flavours.

133
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,680
If everything goes to plan, then
yeah, hopefully, it'll all go well.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
While the sugar hit of the other
teams' cakes should keep the judges

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,200
awake, Resorts World's could send
them to sleep.

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,800
One of my favourite childhood
memories was the malted milk drinks

137
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,480
at bedtime, so I'm using malted milk

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,800
and salted caramel and a bit of
chocolate.

139
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
Mm-mm!
I'll be feeling tired today.

140
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,200
My filling for my macaron, it's an
almond and chocolate sponge.

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,760
It will help with the structure, as
well, so it won't collapse on me.

142
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,200
Traditionally, macarons are cooked
as small, piped domes,

143
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
but on a scale as large as this,

144
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
the teams must do things
differently.

145
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,120
Go slowly, go slowly.

146
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
Piping a thin spiral disk allows an
even bake.

147
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,520
Anything other than this may leave a
soggy bottom.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,520
When they're baked, they should
still have the spiral.

149
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,320
Benoit made it clear, actually,
that's what he's looking for.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,720
They want to see the spiral.

151
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,040
Why are you piping?
For the macaron cake.

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,960
I know it's not how it's
normally done,

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,360
but this is how I'm used
to doing it.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
Put it in for five minutes.

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,480
Once the macarons are in the oven,
precision timing is essential.

156
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
With such a delicate mixture,

157
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,480
the difference between over and
undercooked can be seconds.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,040
They're going to have ten minutes,
then I'm going to open up the door.

159
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,640
Then I'm going to move them about,

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,960
then they're going to have another
eight to ten minutes.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
Take them out too soon and they'll
collapse under the weight of

162
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,600
the fillings. Leave them too long
and they'll shatter.

163
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,320
I've put 20 minutes on it,

164
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,880
and very likely something like five
minutes more for each side.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,600
You've had two hours, chefs, and
you've got 1.5 hours left.

166
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,800
Not only must the teams produce a
flawless and elegant
tiered macaron cake...

167
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,600
..It must be accompanied by
trente-six sucettes.

168
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,960
That's 36 lollipops to you and me.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
It's the quarterfinal now.

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,160
I do not want to see a boring
lollipop.

171
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,680
I want to see fun, I want to see
colour,

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,880
I want to see fantastic flavour.

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,960
I want them to bring out whatever
they had in their childhood.

174
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,200
The teams are free to use any
technique to produce their sucettes,

175
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,920
however, Benoit and Cherish will not
only be judging flavour,

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,760
they'll be assessing innovation and
imagination, too.

177
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm just piping the financier mix
into the flexi-moulds.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,480
It's just like a small cake, a small
cake on a stick.

179
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
It's like a fancy cake pop.

180
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,600
Along with their French
patisserie-inspired financier cake
pops,

181
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,160
Eddie and Mahshid will present milk
chocolate sucettes filled with

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,280
a lemon caramel and coffee cremeux.

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,040
Are your two lollipops going to be
quite dull?

184
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,880
No, the flavours will speak for
themselves.

185
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,680
The flavours are great. So it's
nothing on the visual with you?

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
You've given up on the visual?

187
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,160
No, it will look nice, but it won't
go over the top.

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
Confident, Mahshid! Yes. Yeah!

189
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,320
While Eddie and Mahshid focus
on French flavours,

190
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
Sam's recreating a British classic.

191
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
This is just a vanilla sable

192
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,840
for the outside of our apple rhubarb
crumble lollies.

193
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,520
Being English,
most English families would have

194
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,760
apple crumble on a Sunday after a
roast dinner.

195
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,320
It definitely brings
back a lot of memories for me.

196
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,520
Like Sam, Hideko's also taking
inspiration from the comforts of
home.

197
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,720
You had carrot cake
when you were little? Of course!

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,600
In Japan?

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,960
The nougat's ready.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,080
In Bharat's sweet shop, the healthy
options are a little more limited.

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,760
When I was a kid, I used to love
nougat.

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
There was always a pink and white
nougat in a big packet.

203
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
Oh, I love nougat.
So are you making that today?

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,600
Yeah. Oh, wow, we are looking up for
a treat!

205
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
As well as a sweet tooth,

206
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,280
Bharat's
also catering for expensive tastes,

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,560
with dark chocolate and mandarin
orange gel sucettes

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,160
that are encased in gold leaf.

209
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,040
Is that going to be the
most expensive?

210
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,520
It probably is, yeah.

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,120
It's like 23-carat gold leaf.
Ooh! Wow! Sounds rich.

212
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,080
Will I be able to get my teeth
through it?

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,440
Yeah, you can have a gold tooth.

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,240
You are going to finish your
tasting...!

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,360
With so many elements to this
challenge,

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,120
Leanne and Romain may have hit
upon a short cut.

217
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,400
I'm just piping the mini macarons
for one of the lollipops.

218
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,880
Macaron? Did I hear "macaron"?

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,760
I thought you were picking the big
macaron.

220
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,920
We're making small ones, as well.

221
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,240
Is that cheating? I'm making the two
separate batches.

222
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,320
Leanne's second serving of macarons

223
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,440
will be accompanied by sucettes of
orange-soaked Pain de Genes

224
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,280
and mandarin pate de fruit,

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
finished with a dark chocolate
orange ganache.

226
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,400
So, it's a sponge with basically
orange jelly on top,

227
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,000
with a dark chocolate
covering, is that right, Leanne?

228
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,600
Yeah. That sounds very, um,
original.

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
It sounds like a Jaffa Cake! Shh!

230
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,520
Chefs, you have one hour left!

231
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,760
That's one hour!
For now, it's going all right.

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
A lot to do, you know, so...
Still a lot to do.

233
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,560
It's the big push now.

234
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
This is the small macaron for the
lollipop.

235
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
Yeah, I'm really happy with these.

236
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,960
I'm just filling the base of our
chocolate shells

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
with the lemon caramel,

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,240
and then I'm going to top it off
with the coffee cremeux.

239
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,840
You have to love coffee to love
this.

240
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,360
So it's like a 24-Bharat gold...

241
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,920
24-Bharat! 24-BHARAT gold!

242
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,400
As the teams construct their
sucettes...

243
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,440
..It's crunch time for their
macarons.

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,160
Let me just take these out.

245
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

246
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,080
Good? They're looking good?

247
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
Dry enough?

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,400
BLEEP. Man, I'm going to
need a hand.

249
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,800
Just get a little palette.

250
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,160
Get a little palette to scrape this
out.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,120
The macarons are slightly under,

252
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,440
so I'm cooking them a little bit
more.

253
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
Are you good for time? Yeah.

254
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
It's just the macaron left to build
and that's it.

255
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,120
Are we going to start assembling?

256
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,320
Those with macarons baked can push
on and assemble their cakes.

257
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,720
I'm just sticking the macarons,

258
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,240
and then I'm going to lay the top
bit on.

259
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,440
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left!

260
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,960
That's 15 minutes left!

261
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,520
They need the freezer.

262
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,440
Warm macarons will melt their
fillings

263
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
and cause their cake to collapse.

264
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,680
Can you start piping?

265
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,400
Do this one first so I can decorate
it with the fruit.

266
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
We're getting so close now.

267
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
It's just whether we can get it done
in time.

268
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
I hope it doesn't collapse.

269
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,920
No, I meant...swirls.
Never mind.

270
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,120
It's too big for the swirls.
Never mind, never mind.

271
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
BLEEP. 'Sake! Oh, come on, man!

272
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,000
You do it, then! Jesus Christ.

273
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,680
BLEEP!

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,480
It looks good at the moment.

275
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
How long have we got left?

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,680
Chefs, you've got five minutes left,
five minutes!

277
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
Straight into the fridge.

278
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
BLEEP. Crikey.

279
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,480
Let's hope the judge thinks they're
perfect, as well.

280
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,560
Chefs, your time is up,
your time is up!

281
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
Please leave your macarons at the of
end your workbenches

282
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
and step away from them.

283
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,640
Five tiered macaron cakes
and 180 sucettes

284
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
in just three and a half hours.

285
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,480
Now the teams await the judgment
of Benoit and cherish.

286
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,160
Can Hideko and Theo from Sweet
Art Lab please come forward?

287
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
THEY GASP

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Oh, luh, luh...!

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,480
Phew! Whoof!

290
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,560
Well, it looks like
you've had a good day.

291
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,920
I like the subtle colour of
your macaron.

292
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,040
So, would you be able to tell us
what we've have got?

293
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
Mm-hmm.

294
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,120
OK.

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,720
Is it frozen? Yeah, it's frozen.

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,240
So you've built it frozen? Yes.
OK.

297
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
It's like an ice cream macaron.

298
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
What a shame.

299
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,600
The taste, I really like.

300
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
But I can't feel the texture. Mm.

301
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
At the moment,
I've got a block of ice.

302
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,520
If you could have sell me that this
is a frozen entremets,

303
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
you nailed it.

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
Lollipop...

305
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,480
So, the dark one is a mandarin pain
de fruit

306
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,600
with an Earl Grey tea
and dark chocolate ganache.

307
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,560
My first impression is
that they are humongous.

308
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
I'm going to try. Don't look.

309
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,400
It tastes as it looks.
It's very heavy.

310
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
Carrot cake...

311
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,120
Lovely sponge, not too dry,
fairly light,

312
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,640
but the frosting
is dry a little bit.

313
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,200
I think you can
give us better than this.

314
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,120
Visually, it's beautiful.

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,480
It's quite nice that you decorated
your macaron with chocolate.

316
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,040
Could you take us through
your flavour, please, thank you?

317
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,960
It's a malted milk cremeux
with salted caramel inside

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,280
and a chocolate almond sponge.

319
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
I love it.

320
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,600
I'm really... It works.

321
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,080
The flavour profile in there,
I can't have this all day.

322
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,400
I love this.
It's a craving I would get. Mm!

323
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,960
What about the lollipops?
This is a chocolate and orange...

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,080
Am I actually nervous to eat it?

325
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm not too sure
if I want golden teeth.

326
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,320
I'm too young for golden teeth.

327
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,800
Um... That's too thick.

328
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
Yeah. Most of it is a chunk of dark
chocolate, which can be very hard.

329
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,360
Did I enjoy that?

330
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
Mm... Not really.

331
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,680
That's a raspberry, pistachio
and almond nougat.

332
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,000
I think the execution is quite poor.

333
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,560
Shall we taste?

334
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,480
I think it's a little bit soft
for my liking,

335
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,920
and it's sticking everywhere
as well.

336
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
I don't think
I really enjoy eating this.

337
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
HE SIGHS
It's our turn.

338
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
Our turn for a BLEEP.

339
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,440
The finishing touches here,
you rushed,

340
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,960
you were struggling
to finish on time, or...?

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah, the segments were
a very last-minute thing.

342
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,680
Well, overall, doesn't look great.

343
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
Remind us what's in
the macaron cake.

344
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,840
Inside we have an orange sponge,
citrus curd,

345
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
a fresh grapefruit and blood orange
jelly

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,760
and then a mascarpone Chantilly
on the outside.

347
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,520
Oh! Tshh!

348
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,800
I would not need this because
it looks more like a pancake.

349
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
And it's very soggy as well.

350
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,960
The only thing that
I enjoy eating is your fresh fruit

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
because it's very refreshing.

352
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,600
Other than that,
I didn't enjoy eating it at all.

353
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
So, we have got our lollipops.

354
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,880
First thing, are they
overly imaginative?

355
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,720
No.

356
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
So, shall we start with this one?

357
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,920
This one is a gianduja financier.

358
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,920
Boring, boring, boring.

359
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,000
Boing, boing, boing!

360
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,880
I want more!
It is dry as well. OK. Sorry.

361
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,440
Could you explain
what is inside, please?

362
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,440
Lemon caramel and coffee cremeux.

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,280
The lemon, I don't think it works
with coffee.

364
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,360
And the chocolate shell is
very thick.

365
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
The first taste I taste
is bitterness.

366
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,280
It's all bitter, bitter, bitter.

367
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,360
And just don't enjoy
eating this at all.

368
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,440
You're going to have
a lot to do tomorrow.

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
That's is not bitter. No...

370
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,560
I think that the filling
is quite squashed in a way.

371
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,320
It doesn't show the beauty of
the filling.

372
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
Remind me what the flavours
are in there.

373
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,240
Banana and caramel ganache.

374
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,080
Bad news first -

375
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
the texture, a bit too soft.

376
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,000
Good news - good flavour, loved
the banana, it's clean to cut.

377
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,240
Well done.

378
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,760
Remind me, what is this again?

379
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,480
SAM: It's a vanilla sable
with a streusel on top,

380
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,040
rhubarb jelly on the outside,

381
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,880
and then inside you have
caramelised apple.

382
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,040
I like the concept. The rhubarb,
I think it's very acidic.

383
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,680
However, I do like the apple.

384
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,160
So, as a whole, it's OK.

385
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,640
I was hoping for more. Next one.

386
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,040
It's a hazelnut
and almond chocolate.

387
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,960
It really made me feel like,
you know, "eat me".

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,040
That's a good sign.

389
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,360
I love it!

390
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
ALL: Oh...!

391
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,200
I love it. I could have eat more.

392
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,920
There's so many textures in there,
and even the coating is sensational.

393
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
Love it, love it, love it.

394
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,840
But because I'm looking after my
figure...I'm not going to eat more.

395
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,360
If you told me before
we'd go out there

396
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,840
and have that judging,
I'd have bit your hand off.

397
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,640
We are already starting cracking, so
wrong technique to do the macaron.

398
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
Would you be able to take us through
the flavour profile, please?

399
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,400
So, it's a peanut ganache.

400
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,920
It's got a peanut mousse
and then caramelised peanuts inside.

401
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
Do you think so, it's cooked?
That's the problem.

402
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,160
When it comes to build it, we
realised the macaroon wasn't cooked.

403
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,800
Yeah. So we tried to put it back
in the oven, then...

404
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,200
We ended up having to build it hot.

405
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,280
..and the macaron was too warm, so
all the filling just collapsing.

406
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,080
This is exactly what we don't want.

407
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,280
So a lot to pick up
with your lollipop - hopefully!

408
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,680
So it's a pain de Gene sponge topped
with a orange and vanilla syrup.

409
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,880
Then you've got a mandarin
pate de fruit

410
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,880
and then a chocolate-orange ganache.

411
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
The pain de Gene is dry
and it's not pleasant.

412
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
Not great. Not great, guys.

413
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,160
ROMAIN: So it's coconut and coconut
rum ganache with a coconut macaron.

414
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,880
At least this macaron is cooked.

415
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,560
I did not enjoy eating this at all.

416
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,880
I'm sorry, guys, but not at all.

417
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
Thank you very much, guys.
I will see later.

418
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
It's constructive criticism.

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,600
We know that they want us
to do a lot better.

420
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
If we don't push tomorrow
and we go out,

421
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,840
we will be like, you know,
so disappointed,

422
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,560
because we didn't do our best.

423
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,080
So we need to keep...
Yeah, we need to keep positive.

424
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,320
Tomorrow's showpiece will require
the teams to combine both

425
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,160
sugar craft and chocolate work for
the first time in the competition.

426
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,560
So using the golden hour wisely
to get any large elements

427
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,200
set overnight will be
more vital than ever.

428
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
First-half of the quarterfinal done,

429
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,560
and it's pretty fair to say the
teams didn't really deliver today.

430
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,120
It was a difficult day
for all the teams today.

431
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,840
Three have done marginally better.

432
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,200
Resorts World.

433
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,080
The Hilton have done pretty well.

434
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,520
And Sweet Art Lab have done
something actually nice to eat.

435
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:53,600
I see, realistically, two teams
in trouble for tomorrow -

436
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,800
The Savoy and Hotel Cafe Royal.

437
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
Tomorrow's showpiece challenge is

438
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,640
perhaps the most challenging
one yet.

439
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,000
They have to understand that
this is the quarterfinal -

440
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,800
the next level they are going
through is semifinal.

441
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
"Good" is not good enough any more.

442
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,320
The theme is fairy tales.

443
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,680
Let's hope we have a happy ending
and that nobody...dies.

444
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,880
BIRDSONG

445
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,520
Morning. Morning, morning.
Welcome back.

446
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,080
No throwing your toys out of
the pram today, chefs,

447
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,280
but do throw everything you've
got at this challenge.

448
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,680
Judges, what would you like
the teams to create today?

449
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,720
We would like you to make
a spectacular showpiece

450
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,440
inspired by fairy tale and featuring
chocolate work and sugar work.

451
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:53,080
Your showpiece must tell us
a story and take us

452
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,280
back to childhood with
your design and colour.

453
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,840
You must make
two identical entremet cakes.

454
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,840
You must glaze your cakes and they
must include chocolate flavours.

455
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,360
Remember, we expect nothing less
than perfection.

456
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,640
You had one hour last night
to prepare.

457
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,160
You have four hours left today
to complete the challenge.

458
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,000
Bonne chance. Your time starts now.

459
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,120
Where's my eggs?
Timer. Timer, timer, timer...

460
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:24,400
This showpiece is the most
technically challenging yet.

461
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,920
Well, this is the quarterfinal.

462
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,600
We see what they can do
with chocolate,

463
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,120
we see what they can do with sugar,

464
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,320
now it's time to put it
all together.

465
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,080
Combining sugar and chocolate
is fraught with difficulties.

466
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,480
Chocolate do not like heat,
which sugar need to glue together.

467
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,640
So how is this going to work?
I leave that up to them.

468
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,920
I've never combined
sugar and chocolate together,

469
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,120
it's not something I've ever
really seen either.

470
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,000
What's important for me -
it has to be enchanting, magical

471
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,320
and take me to the fairy tale world.

472
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,360
They want us to create a fairy tale

473
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
and we thought there is
no better place than the kitchen.

474
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,920
For fairy tales?
You're killing me!

475
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
OK, tell us your story.

476
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:07,400
It's about an old chef who wants
to create that amazing dish,

477
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,000
that perfect recipe.

478
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,440
Is that his recipe book fair?

479
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,360
It's going to be
his secret recipe book.

480
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,400
CHERISH: Oh, I like that,
I like that, secret recipe.

481
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,280
Emmanuel and Sam's entremet

482
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,840
has a white chocolate mousse,

483
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,480
layers of passion fruit mousse,

484
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,000
a passion fruit jelly

485
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,120
and a mango and vanilla jelly.

486
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,520
But it will still taste of
chocolate? To me, it's more exotic.

487
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,840
It needs to be chocolate. OK.

488
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,200
After their performance
in yesterday's challenge,

489
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,840
Romain and Leanne needs to deliver
a virtuoso showpiece today.

490
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,440
They've opted for
a more traditional fairy tale

491
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,840
that will be built
from coloured sugar.

492
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,200
For the showpiece, we are doing
a castle on the background.

493
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,160
A whole one?! Part of a whole one.

494
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,200
We're going to have a road where
the carriage will sit on

495
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:54,440
and the shoes under the entremet.

496
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,120
CHERISH: So is this your fairy tale,
or Romain's fairy tale?

497
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,920
No, it's my fairy tale! It is,
it is. With golden slipper!

498
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,280
It's my childhood.

499
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,680
I was playing with castles
and princess all the time.

500
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
Aw!

501
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,320
Hotel Cafe Royal's taste of
childhood will see layers of

502
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,920
chocolate and caramel and

503
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,360
mascarpone honey mousses

504
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,280
topped with a clear lemon glaze

505
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,680
and it will sit above

506
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,280
the entrance of their castle.

507
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,840
How do you actually
stick together

508
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,440
the sugar and
the chocolate components?

509
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,560
They will be separate. They are not
going to have to stick together.

510
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:27,640
What? Yeah, they will be separate.

511
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,960
The technicality in this is try
to bind the two together, guys.

512
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,320
One way or another, so we'd like to
see a little bit of that if you can.

513
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,560
Good luck, guys. Thank you.

514
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,640
Despite last week's
catastrophic sugar crash,

515
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,920
Hideko's enthusiasm for
the ingredient hasn't diminished.

516
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,120
You can create anything. You can
make it so colourful as well.

517
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:58,680
Her multicoloured sugar work is also
being used to illustrate

518
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,160
the story of Cinderella
and her unique carriage.

519
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:15,440
The pumpkin theme continues
in Sweet Art Lab's entremet,

520
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,080
for along with a white chocolate
ganache, they're serving

521
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,960
a crunchy pumpkin seed streusel

522
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
and a pumpkin and citrus mousse.

523
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,960
Is there any decoration
on the entremet?

524
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,560
Trying to make a little pumpkin,
blown sugar.

525
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,800
Blown sugar pumpkin?
Tiny one. Tiny ones.

526
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,160
Like Hideko, Eddie has already
struggled with sugar in the past,

527
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,040
but he's decided to throw caution to
the wind by including complex

528
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:40,400
blown sugar work to help
bring his fairy tale to life.

529
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,480
We've gone for, like,
a genie in the lamp.

530
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
I like that.

531
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,200
The idea is it's with
a tall structure ring.

532
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,560
Structure with chocolate.

533
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,720
And the magic carpet is going
to be a sugar ribbon.

534
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,040
Oh, magic carpet - I like that.

535
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,240
So are you going to make
the genies as well?

536
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,040
Yeah, I'm going to try
and blow the genie.

537
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,240
The Savoy's magical chocolate
showpiece will rub up to

538
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,600
an entremet packed with

539
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,080
layers of chocolate sponge,

540
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,320
passion fruit jelly,

541
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,600
passion fruit cremeux,

542
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,880
a dark chocolate mousse,

543
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,520
topped off with a chocolate lamp.

544
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,360
Mashid, what are you wishing for?
Wishing we win.

545
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,480
Right, that's good.
I like you wishing to win.

546
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,840
We didn't enter to lose -
we entered to win.

547
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,120
Bharat and Darryl are also hoping
for a fairy tale ending

548
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,920
with a showpiece whose story
began in a relative's backyard.

549
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,600
Myself and my sister used to go
to my auntie's house,

550
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,960
and at the bottom of her garden
she had a tree,

551
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,360
and at the bottom of that tree,
used to have a little door

552
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,520
and she always used to say that
it was fairies in that door.

553
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,360
Do you believe in fairies?
I do. I'm a bit old for that now.

554
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,760
You believe in fairies, Cherish?
Of course I believe in fairies!

555
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,560
With its strawberry gel insert,
orange and milk chocolate mousse,

556
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,960
vanilla and orange sponge

557
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,520
and marble glaze,

558
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,600
Resorts World's colourful entremet

559
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,240
will nestle at the heart

560
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,000
of their fairy showpiece.

561
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,880
We're going to have a tree stump,
obviously with a little door.

562
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:02,040
Behind it I'm going to do a moon,
and we'll have the fairy in

563
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,360
the centre of that moon

564
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,640
and I'm going to do some
pulled ribbon for her wings.

565
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,200
How did you manage to combine
the chocolate

566
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,160
and the sugar together?

567
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,560
We haven't got that far yet, but
I've got a few ideas.

568
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,560
You know, it's still in development.

569
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,840
Not only must the teams produce a
flawless and fantastical showpiece,

570
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,520
they must also ensure their
entremets are perfectly constructed.

571
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,560
An entremet is
a multilayer mousse cake.

572
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,840
Every layer has to tell me a story.

573
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
This is white chocolate.

574
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
We didn't really eat
dark chocolate as a kid.

575
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,160
The teams made some of the elements
of their multi-layered entremet

576
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
in yesterday's golden hour.

577
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,360
They're really nice.
I'm happy with them.

578
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,080
But the chefs still need to flavour
and combine them.

579
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,080
I'm just going to soak this cake in
orange. This will be just the base.

580
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,720
I think our entremet is
looking good.

581
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,240
Just need to do the white chocolate
mousse to go over the top

582
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,720
and then that can go in the freezer.

583
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,400
This is the chocolate mousse.

584
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,080
I built mine upside down.

585
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,400
You will have a nice flat surface
on the top

586
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,760
and then, when you pour your glaze,
it will be nice and even.

587
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,200
To hold its shape, the mousse
must be perfectly set.

588
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,360
One leaf of gelatine in there.

589
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
Too much gelatine
and it will be unpleasant to eat.

590
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,440
Test it a few times to make sure
it is not too firm

591
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,720
for the judges, cos I know
they don't like gelatine.

592
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,640
For Leanne, it means facing
her nemesis once again.

593
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
Yeah, this is gelatine.

594
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
We've toned it down in this recipe.

595
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,160
Is it not too liquid?

596
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,520
Was it a lot thicker last time?

597
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,680
A little bit.
I wouldn't say it was much thicker.

598
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
Double the amount of gelatine. Yeah?

599
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,800
Chefs, you are halfway through
your fairy tale, halfway through.

600
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,320
With entremets setting, the teams
turn their attention to sugar.

601
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,440
BLEEP. It's scorching round here.
Temperature for sugar work is fine.

602
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,840
It's very warm in here
for chocolate, though.

603
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,160
With so many sugar elements
to construct,

604
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,080
it's vital the teams begin the hot,
arduous process of turning

605
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,960
this everyday ingredient
into their fairy tale decorations.

606
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
The first time I ever saw
sugar work done,

607
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,320
I thought it was pretty magical.

608
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,480
When you pick up sugar,
you don't see it as

609
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,680
turning into flowers and stuff.

610
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,040
I've done some little roses
with a leaf

611
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,920
and I did a sphere
with the roses inside.

612
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,800
I'm going to do all four of them.
I think it's a nice touch.

613
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,280
Blowing sugar is a fiddly
and time-consuming process

614
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,120
that's prone to breakages.

615
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,040
I have not much experience with
sugar work.

616
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,040
I know it's fragile!

617
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,800
SUGAR WORK SHATTERS

618
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,920
Broke that one.

619
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,200
Despite this, Eddie's once again
making complex sugar work

620
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,480
the focal point of his showpiece.

621
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,400
We've got the lamp,
we've got the magic carpet,

622
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,560
and this is the genie.

623
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,160
And I'll put this under the lamp,

624
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,760
and I'll just shape it, you know,
to give it more that genie look.

625
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,560
It's a risky decision.

626
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,160
Without a well-crafted genie,
his fairy tale will fall flat.

627
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,680
SUGAR WORK SHATTERS
BLEEP! BLEEP!

628
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,040
I need to start this again.

629
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,720
I'm going to pull a ribbon now,
and that's for the wings.

630
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,560
While the rest of the teams
move on with their sugar work,

631
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,640
Eddie has fallen behind.

632
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,480
He's yet to successfully
blow his genie.

633
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,440
Eddie and Mashid,
I really like the concept

634
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,880
they've put into their genies.

635
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,320
Lamp and a magic carpet.

636
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,040
We just need to see a finished,
skilful Showpiece

637
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,960
for them to ferry out.
We've got the chocolate piece

638
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,160
which at the moment
is not combined with the sugar.

639
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,760
I need to see
that they've made the effort

640
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,160
of combining sugar and chocolate
together.

641
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,560
Hideko and Theo, I really like
the idea of the pumpkin

642
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,680
to be incorporated into entremet.

643
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,080
Having said that,
it is a chocolate cake,

644
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,840
so we need to feel the chocolate.

645
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,680
BLEEP! BLEEP!

646
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,840
BLEEP!

647
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,600
That's the magic carpet there.

648
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,040
I'm not sure the next one's as thin.

649
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,960
As Eddie races to salvage
yet more sugar work...

650
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,960
Argh! It's just wasting time.

651
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,840
..those with completed components

652
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,160
now face the most technically
complex construction...

653
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,320
That was a mistake.

654
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,680
..the competition has ever seen.

655
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,360
Right. Freeze.

656
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,000
GASPS

657
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,440
Pig.

658
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
It's cold, isn't it?

659
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,520
The cold spray that sets chocolate
can break sugar.

660
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,320
And the extreme heat
that sugar requires to melt

661
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,520
doesn't sit well with chocolate.

662
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,200
Are you having trouble
sticking it together?

663
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,920
That's going to take forever.

664
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

665
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,080
GASPS
Sorry, sorry.

666
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,600
Are you OK? Yeah.

667
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,760
I'm building it as it goes,
you know?

668
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
Brilliant.

669
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

670
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,600
Pushed for time now.

671
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,840
Ten minutes. Write a letter
to your childhood self,

672
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,080
tell them you didn't mess up
this challenge.

673
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,960
Oh, what happened?

674
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,080
BLEEP. Oh, my God.

675
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,480
Not only must the teams
construct their Showpieces,

676
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,160
they must also get
their entremets glazed

677
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,640
in time for them to set.

678
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,440
Man, the white's
not coming out enough.

679
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
Glaze looks all right. Really shiny.

680
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
Oh!

681
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,720
Take your time.
I won't have time to do more.

682
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
Leaning a lot, that.

683
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,160
Oh, Bharat.

684
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
Yeah, but soon as
you put it on there...

685
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,520
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have to be
really careful

686
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,800
otherwise it'll just shatter.
Don't do it.

687
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,080
BLEEP.

688
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,640
Put one of them on top there
for now.

689
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,760
Yeah. What is cracking?

690
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,880
CRACKING
No!

691
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,240
Quick, quick, quick.

692
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,400
We didn't put enough gelatine in.
Not going to last.

693
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,760
BLEEP.

694
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,960
Oh, you piece of BLEEP.

695
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,360
GROWLS

696
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,680
I want it on!

697
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,680
Chefs, you have one minute left.

698
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,280
That's one minute.

699
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
BLEEP.

700
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
BLEEP!

701
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,960
Chefs, your time is up!

702
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,520
BLEEP.

703
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,040
The clock is chiming.

704
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,040
Your carriage awaits.

705
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,040
The Hilton's looks fantastic.

706
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,240
So gutted about this.

707
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,600
Five fantastical fairy tale
showpieces,

708
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,840
and their accompanying
chocolate entremets,

709
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,320
but which will earn their team
a place in the semifinal?

710
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,120
That is what I call a showpiece.

711
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,320
Everywhere we look there
is a story in there.

712
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,840
I really like the bubble that you
incorporate to the secret recipe.

713
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,640
When you see the little
attention here,

714
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,680
that pot and the flames underneath,
yeah, I really like that.

715
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,360
Of course, you got with the right
strategy, which is

716
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
work with chocolate to get maximum
height, volume, strong

717
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,400
structure and bring your lighter,
more delicate sugar element after.

718
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,800
What's inside your entremets?

719
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,680
White chocolate mousse with mango
and vanilla jelly,

720
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,080
passion fruit jelly
and vanilla sponge.

721
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
Boom.

722
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,520
Really enjoy eating
the chocolate mousse.

723
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,840
I like it when you put the fresh
mango in. Overall, it's nice.

724
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,080
It's a pleasant cake, you get the
passion fruit, you get the mango.

725
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,960
It's like I've got a fruit
entremets, not a chocolate cake.

726
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,680
Oh, dear God, help us.

727
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,040
I don't how BLEEP they got that done
in the time.

728
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
I really don't.

729
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,600
This is it, all your work for the
quarterfinal is done? Mm-hm.

730
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,320
Does it look like you wanted?
Things didn't go to plan.

731
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,720
Well, there is a visual, there is
a nice contrast of colour which

732
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,120
brings a little bit of the
fairytale element.

733
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,560
We've got some sugar work,
some ribbon.

734
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,520
Clearly, we see that something
has happened there.

735
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,200
Of course, I would have hoped
a little bit of height.

736
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,440
I think the concept is there.

737
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,800
When I look at the mushroom it's
quite heavy-handed,

738
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,560
but the back mushrooms over there,
I think they look really cute.

739
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,040
The cake is milk chocolate and
orange sponge base,

740
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,840
soaked in orange syrup.

741
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,400
A layer on top
of that is the strawberry gel,

742
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,280
and a white chocolate ganache.

743
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,560
I can feel the white
chocolate cremeux.

744
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,680
I get the contrast of the orange
and strawberry jelly.

745
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,400
The texture, for me, is great.

746
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,080
It does feel very creamy
but the glaze is a bit sticky.

747
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,040
The gelatine, you could have added
maybe just a touch more,

748
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,680
a few grams more,
so that the cake is propped.

749
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,720
At the moment the cake is sagging.
The chocolate mousse is OK.

750
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,160
However, the sponge is not
enjoyable.

751
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,640
Did you struggle with time?

752
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,400
Oh, we got everything
pretty much done,

753
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,440
but we had a couple of accidents and
we had to fix a couple of problems.

754
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,520
I remember you mentioned a flying
carpet to me. Yes.

755
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,960
So where is the flying carpet?

756
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,280
Well, the top pieces of chocolate
had fallen down and broke

757
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,600
the big one that I had done in half.
OK.

758
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,720
Will I come to this table
and see this as a showpiece

759
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,560
which is straight, the genie
in the lamp story?

760
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
No.

761
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,080
This is a lamp, could be a teapot,

762
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,440
and that blue thing here is
flat, there is no character.

763
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,040
The rest is just a ball, a loop,
a few swirls. It is not enough.

764
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,320
I really hope your cake
tastes amazing.

765
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,600
On the bottom is a chocolate sponge
and then inside is a passion fruit

766
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,120
curd, exotic jelly
and chocolate mousse.

767
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,320
Chocolate mousse is quite smooth
and nice.

768
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,720
Really like the passion fruit curd,
it's really creamy.

769
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,400
The only thing that
I don't really enjoy is the sponge.

770
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,480
I think it's very, very dry.

771
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,440
Your chocolate mousse, Mahshid,
is well done, well executed.

772
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,520
It's beautiful. Thank you.

773
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
The passion fruit with it can work.
For me, there is too much of it.

774
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,080
What's missing is texture.

775
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,640
Everything is soft and for that,
it's a bit boring. Yeah.

776
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,600
Would you be able to show me
where the chocolate

777
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,320
and the sugar has actually been
working together?

778
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,960
Yes, so I've done
the roof of the castle in chocolate

779
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,760
and a sort of entrance
for the castle in chocolate.

780
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,440
Is that an entrance here?
I thought it's a moon.

781
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,160
And this could be a chimney.

782
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,240
Or, yeah, it's a castle, chimney,
castle.

783
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,240
But this is nice. Thank you.

784
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,200
Romain being Romain, a little
bit of sugar doesn't kill anyone,

785
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,200
and I see the finesse in your work.

786
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,360
I see a lot of potential
when you said princess.

787
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,120
But where's the diamond?
Where's the glitter on the crown?

788
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
Let's see if the cake delivers.

789
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,840
LEANNE: So it's a chocolate sponge,
got a chocolate crunchy layer.

790
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,680
On top of that it's got a caramel
layer on.

791
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,320
It's got a chocolate mousse and then
on top of that it's got a lemon
glaze.

792
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,160
I like the way you
balance your cake.

793
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,600
There's plenty of texture in there.
I like it. I really do.

794
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,400
I really like the sponge
at the bottom,

795
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,480
the caramel and the crunch element,
everything goes together.

796
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,680
It's very pleasant.

797
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,360
The first thing I'm going to say is,
watch your gelatine.

798
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,680
However, it tastes really nice.
BOTH: Thank you.

799
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
Thank you very much.

800
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,720
It's very enchanting, it's very
fascinating, it's very magical.

801
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
You've got orange,
you've got blue, you've got pink.

802
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,120
The chocolate element,
at the moment I'm trying to look.

803
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,000
Chocolate, is that chocolate?
Yeah. Underneath?

804
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,240
But that doesn't
consider as the decoration for me.

805
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,320
The carriage,
I really like the design.

806
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,200
You had issues, clearly,
but this could have been done neatly

807
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,120
and it would have worked perfectly.

808
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,000
Taste your entremets.

809
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,720
It's a pumpkin seed
streusel on the bottom,

810
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,960
and then it's almond and chocolate
Moelleux, white chocolate

811
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,080
kabosu namelaka and a pumpkin
white chocolate kabosu mousse.

812
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,000
Pumpkin? Yes.
Can't really taste the pumpkin.

813
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,560
The black chocolate sponge is a
brownie type?

814
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,160
On the chocolate Moelleux.

815
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
I love it. I really,
really like that texture.

816
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,160
It's not dry, it's rich
and there is the chocolate flavour.

817
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,760
You have brilliant ideas,

818
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,800
but there is some finishing touches
you clearly can't manage to achieve.

819
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,680
I hope if you are moving forward,
that you can address this.

820
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,200
Based on their performance in both
challenges,

821
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,880
Benoit and Cherish will now
rank the teams.

822
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,520
The team in last place will miss out
on the semifinal.

823
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,120
Oh, I like that.

824
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,400
When Cherish stepped up
and was just like, wow,

825
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,080
and I was like,
this is what I've been waiting for.

826
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,760
I've been waiting for a wow moment!

827
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,320
EMMANUEL: We hope it's good enough
to get to the semifinal.

828
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,520
Ah, it's very untidy.

829
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm content with where we've got,

830
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,800
but we still have that
hunger to keep going forward.

831
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,680
You're never safe in this
competition.

832
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,960
If we have to go out,
then that's the game, you know?

833
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,200
Benoit and Cherish have
made their decision.

834
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:42,600
The team in first place delivered
a lovely sucette yesterday and

835
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:46,600
were in a complete league of their
own in today's showpiece challenge.

836
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,920
Congratulations, Emmanuel
and Sam from Hilton Park Lane,

837
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,680
you are through to the semifinal.

838
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,440
In joint second place are...

839
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,960
..Hideko and Theo
from Sweet Art Lab,

840
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,000
and Darryl and Bharat from
Resorts World.

841
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:10,320
Congratulations,
you are both also through.

842
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:20,240
Which leaves Leanne and Romain
from Hotel Cafe Royal

843
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:23,280
and Eddie and Mahshid
from The Savoy.

844
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:29,040
The team who will be leaving
the competition tonight is...

845
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,240
..Eddie and Mahshid.

846
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:45,320
I have enjoyed my time here but it
has been very, very stressful,

847
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
I have to say.
You should be proud of yourselves.

848
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,080
You should be proud of yourself.
Benoit came up to us at the end.

849
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,680
He knows all we can do.
And he's seen what we can do.

850
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,920
They still know what we can do.

851
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,480
Congratulations.

852
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,640
EMMANUEL: In first place,
we are more than happy.

853
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,360
It does feel really good, can't
wait, to get to the drawing board

854
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,640
and see what we are going to
design for the semifinal.

855
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,280
It's quite unbelievable.
I didn't believe that at all.
No, I thought we was going.

856
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,760
We believe in you.

857
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,440
Semifinal!

858
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,200
Next time... It's very heated,
isn't it? ..it's the semifinal.

859
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,400
Now or never.

860
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,400
A secret recipe
challenge with a twist...

861
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,560
Oh, BEEP.

862
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,520
..and the gastronomic drama of live
plating...

863
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,160
They wanted theatre.
You own the stage today.

864
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,200
..as the curtain falls on one team's
chance of reaching the grand final.

﻿1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,760
Welcome back to Bake Off: The
Professionals,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,040
where we're down to just four teams
battling it out for the three places

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,880
in next week's final. So exciting,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,560
I can't believe it's the semifinal
already, Liam,

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,120
I don't know what to wear! Bro, it's
OK, you look good.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
Oh, Liam, thank you, that means a
lot. I wonder what the chefs will
wear?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,280
Er, Tom, they kind of wear the same
thing every week.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,240
Do they? Yeah. Jeez, that's so
unimaginative.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,480
I wonder what they'll create,
though? Something insane, no doubt.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,960
Mm, sponge, infused caramel,
chocolate swirls.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
Frangipani. Liam, please, don't call
me that, not in front of these guys.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,880
Last time...

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,880
..the quarterfinal took the teams
back to childhood.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,360
Aww!

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,080
For the Hilton Park Lane's Emmanuel
and Sam, an enchanting creation...

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,080
That is what I call a showpiece.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,680
..meant a fairy tale ending.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,480
First place, Emmanuel and Sam, you
are through to the semifinal.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,400
But for the Savoy's Eddie and
Mahshid, the outlook was grim.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,120
And their semifinal hopes...

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,800
This, as a showpiece, no.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
..vanished in a puff of smoke.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,360
I wish all the other teams the best
of luck in this.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,320
This time... Cheers. ..the last four
teams...

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
It's very heated, isn't it?

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,440
..battle it out for their place in
the final.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,160
It's now or never.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
They'll face a secret recipe, with a
twist...

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,160
It's a lot of pressure on her, at
the moment.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
..and the gastronomic theatre

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,280
of live plating.

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
Parachuting, zip wiring.

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,360
Fire, smoke.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
Who will deserve an encore?

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
They wanted theatre. Woo!

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,040
And who

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
will be booed offstage?

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,680
Just four talented teams remain in
the competition,

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,200
but there can only be three
finalists.

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,720
We're all in it to win it now, and
everyone's training just as hard as
us.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,360
We didn't come that far just to
finish in the semifinal.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
Deep inside, we want to be in the
final, that's for sure.

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
We're going to fight to the finish.
Yep. Mm.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,120
Their first test is a
secret recipe, like no other.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,600
What is this? Maybe they want us
just to relax.

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,000
Any weaknesses in the teams'
relationships are about to be
exposed.

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,040
Welcome to the semifinals, chefs.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,760
It's been a long and arduous road to
get

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
to this stage of the competition,
for all of us.

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,000
I've gone bald, and Liam's started
shaving,

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,440
but today it's about to get even
tougher.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,080
That's right, chefs, because today
you'll be facing another secret
recipe

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,960
challenge. Only, for this one,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,600
the judges have invented a new level
of difficulty.

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,440
We would like you to make a French
dessert, ile flottante.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,360
It must include some form of creme
anglaise, a cooked meringue,

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,320
at least one fruit element, and
finish with sugar work.

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,880
Only one of you will be allowed to
make today's secret recipe.

59
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
What? BLEEP.

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
The other one will have to sit this
one out, I'm afraid,

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,520
and only be able to advise from the
sidelines.

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
BLEEP.

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,960
Now you have two minutes to decide
which of you will be making today's

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,160
secret recipe, and those two minutes
start now.

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Oh, BLEEP... You want to cook?

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
Or I cook?

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
I don't mind. Would you feel better
if I directed you,

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,600
or you directing me?

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,480
To guarantee a place in the final,
it is not just about how good you
are,

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,320
it is about teamwork, and they will
have to trust each other completely.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,320
This challenge is very technical.

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,040
Their knowledge is crucial.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,840
Choosing the wrong person will be
their downfall.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
Go for it.

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,360
Yeah? Yeah.

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
Let it be.

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,480
Chefs, your two minutes is up.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,840
Would the chef who is not taking
part

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,680
in today's secret recipe
challenge, please

80
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,600
have a seat on the stool at the end
of your work station?

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,760
I'm BLEEP scared!

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,040
Chefs, you have two and a half hours
to complete this challenge,

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,160
and your time starts now.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,760
Oh, my God.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
Let's see.

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
Benoit and Cherish have given the
teams minimal guidelines.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
We have to come up with our own
recipes?

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,120
Chef, was there a recipe?

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
OK, just asking. OK, cool.

90
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
That's what you get. The floating
island, or the ile flottante,

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,560
as we say in French, is
meringue,

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,040
which will float on a creme
anglaise.

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,800
Crucially, we've added a fruit
element,

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
which needs to be
incorporated.

95
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,560
There is always a little bit of
caramel spun sugar on it.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,000
With that you could create volume,
you could create shape.

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,880
It has to be delicious and
exquisite.

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,080
They have to combine all the
flavours together to make it a
wowser for us.

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,400
With an array of ingredients at
their disposal...

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
..they can be as traditional...

101
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,920
I'm going to do a cherry and
raspberry jelly.

102
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,680
Raspberry puree. ..or as creative as
they like.

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,320
For Sweet Art Lab's Hideko and Theo,

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
this means another chance to
experiment.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
What liqueur are you putting in?

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,120
We're going to put a little bit of
rum in there.

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,320
It's going to be exotic fruit ile
flottante.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,880
Pina Colada. And you've done your
little scribbling,

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
so you are the one in charge of
writing the recipe down, are you?

110
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Yeah. How does it feel, Hideko, to
be by yourself?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
Super high pressure, isn't it?

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,280
Just a little bit of pressure!

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
Just a tiny bit!

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
The meringue's in the machine.

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,040
It's the most important part.

116
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,160
A floating island is a meringue.

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
An ile flottante, is
made, unsurprisingly,

118
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,400
with French meringue.

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
But Resorts World's Darryl and
Bharat...

120
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,760
We're using Italian meringue,
because it gives it a bit more body.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,320
..are throwing the rule book out of
the window.

122
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,480
The Italian meringue, we heat the
sugar

123
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,800
and then pour it into the
whipped meringue. It's more robust.

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,720
Darryl, Bharat...

125
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,000
Hello. Obviously, because you have
an egg allergy...

126
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
Yes. So I can't taste this.

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,400
This is why I'm putting my trust in
my faithful sidekick.

128
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,080
How do you feel about being a
sidekick?

129
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,600
I thought you were like two heroes.

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,160
Because you've got the, like, Bruce
Wayne kind of haircut,

131
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
and you're definitely Superman.

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,760
With the kryptonite. The kryptonite
is the egg.

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,680
The egg, yeah!

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
Unlike Resorts World, with a
Frenchman on their team,

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,280
Hotel Cafe Royal should have an
advantage.

136
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,880
But Roman has elected to sit on the
sidelines.

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
How are you feeling? Well...

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,280
..stressed for her. For her?

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,440
We are surprised you are the one
sitting down here.

140
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,640
You've eaten all of France has to
offer for many, many years.

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Yes. And you can't taste it today.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
No. I would have preferred to have
been there.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,440
But Roman didn't really give me a
choice!

144
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,920
You're fighting for a space in the
final.

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
How confident are you?

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
The confidence is floating like the
island!

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,120
The proof is in the pudding!

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,560
Chefs, you've had one hour, you've
got an hour and a half left.

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
I'm going to pipe now.

150
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,640
Choosing the correct way to cook
their meringue is essential.

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,240
It will determine whether their
islands float or sink.

152
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,320
It's very fluffy, the egg white,
it's like eating air.

153
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,640
While Hideko and Theo have opted for
a short cut...

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
Trying to cook in a microwave.

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,760
Getting bigger! ..the other teams
are sticking with traditions.

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,160
We are going to steam the meringue,
so slowly cooking the meringue,

157
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
nicely, with water.

158
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,760
Hopefully that will give it some
more height and structure.

159
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,280
But Hilton Park Lane's Emmanuel and
Sam have decided that worrying about

160
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,520
one meringue isn't enough.

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
How are you going to cook your
floating island?

162
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,480
The classic style, which is to poach
ten pieces.

163
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,120
So, how long will it take to poach
your meringue?

164
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,520
That's something we're going to have
to go by the feeling.

165
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,160
My mum used to do that in half an
hour.

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440
Your mother was very good. The whole
floating island.

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,640
I would love your mother to be here
and give us a hand!

168
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,640
Chefs, you have one hour left.

169
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,280
Chefs, you've got to stay on your
stools.

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,200
It's me.

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
Stress central.

172
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,280
The teams must include at least one
fruit element.

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,600
Sam's might going to make fruit
jelly to go inside the meringue.

174
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,600
Passion fruit and mango gel, so the
meringue sits on the gel,

175
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
and it doesn't get that soggy.

176
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,680
Runny jelly will result in a damp
dessert.

177
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,960
We're using raspberry,

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,920
so hopefully we can get it set.

179
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,000
And that's not all they have to
worry about.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
The creme anglaise also needs time
in the chiller...

181
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,720
..but Emmanuel and Sam have to wait.

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,720
We're going to use the milk that we
used to poach to make the anglaise.

183
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,080
We are obviously doing that, and we
can't do the anglaise,

184
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
so we are obviously slowing down.

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
Is that how it's supposed to be?

186
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
It is microwave cooked.

187
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,120
Move, move, move! A perfectly cooked
meringue should be snowy white...

188
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,520
Smell it, it smells very eggy, no?

189
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,280
..and shrink slightly...

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
Oh, yeah, that's good.

191
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
..so it slides easily from the
mould.

192
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,400
Did it stick to it?

193
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,560
Oh!

194
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
BLEEP. Oh, the sprays,

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,960
we can't do stick with the spray,
no?

196
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
OK, let's do another meringue.

197
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
Yep. Another meringue.

198
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,160
How long have we got that? Chefs,
you have half an hour left,

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,280
that's half an hour.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
Bring all the components.

201
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,760
We are changing everything.

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,760
While Leanne and Roman start
meringue number two...

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,120
..Emmanuel and Sam play catch up
with their creme anglaise.

204
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,200
He's going to have to cool it down
very, very quickly.

205
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
If it doesn't cool...

206
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Freezer, freezer, freezer, freezer.

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,680
Sam's going to have to rush from
now.

208
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,880
Their meringue will also collapse.

209
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,720
I've split it into four bowls, I've
split it into four bowls.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,120
Not enough. Come on, come on, come
on, come on.

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,560
It's still not set properly. Well,
what do you want to do?

212
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
Maybe into a piping bag.

213
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,200
Yeah. Scoop it out. You've still
got, what is it, half an hour left?

214
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,640
20 minutes, I'd say. Chefs, you have
15 minutes left, that's 15 minutes.

215
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

216
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,080
Go, go, go, go, go. In the side,
yeah?

217
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,520
BLEEP the side.

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,400
How is it? Not done.

219
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,000
To complete their ile flottante, the
teams must face one final hurdle...

220
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,080
As much of that as you can, Bharat.

221
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
..sugar work. This is...

222
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,760
BLEEP. Sorry, it slides all over the
place.

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,040
Come on, sugar!

224
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,880
Watch your fingers!

225
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
It's a lot of pressure on her at the
moment.

226
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,760
Chefs, you have ten minutes to
finish off your iles flottantes.

227
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,880
How is this?

228
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
It's come up a little bit. Yeah?

229
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,120
Then don't overcook it.

230
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
Oh!

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,640
BLEEP. Come on, Hideko, you can do
it!

232
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,160
It's cooked. Is it coming off?

233
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,000
Is it?

234
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
It's not coming out together.

235
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
How is it? Like, bad.

236
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
Huh? Bad.

237
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
Bad?

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,400
That is what it is. But we can cut
it up.

239
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,640
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

240
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,160
It's OK.

241
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
Watch your backs!

242
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,720
Right, stop, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't
let it bleed.

243
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,640
Maybe put some on the side, if they
want more.

244
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
I think this is enough. It's enough.

245
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,080
Put another one in there. Make it
quick, make it quick,

246
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,400
you've got one minute to go, mate.
You've got your island to go on the
top.

247
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,720
Meringues... Just push it down a
little bit.

248
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,920
Not too much, not too much. As high
as you can.

249
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
Maybe upside down.

250
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,560
Come on...

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,640
Yes, yes, yes.

252
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,760
Seven's fine, no? Seven is fine.

253
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
Give a good push...

254
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
Yeah, looking good.

255
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
Chefs, your time is up.

256
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
That's it there.

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,720
Please bring your iles flottantes to
the display table.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
BLEEP.

259
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,200
The semifinalists' iles flottantes
now face the judgments

260
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,880
of Benoit and Cherish.

261
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
This is for you. Oh.

262
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,320
Bribery. That is called bribery.

263
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
I had nothing to cook, so I just
bring what I've got.

264
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,120
So I got the floating island
and Cherish got the flower.
Yeah, sorry.

265
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,680
OK, presentation.

266
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,240
There's big blocks of caramel
everywhere.

267
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,480
Spun sugar is trying to avoid all
those little pearls.

268
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,480
It's a little bit rough around
the edges.

269
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,800
Compote is a passion fruit mango.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
Feels a bit softer.

271
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,640
Well, the floating island has sunk
under the sea.

272
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,400
The microwaved meringue is very
watery kind of texture,

273
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,200
although I think the jelly is really
tasty, don't you think so?

274
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,640
But there is no floating island.

275
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
It's not baked. So zero, zip.

276
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,800
Anyway, thank you very much.

277
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,880
See you later. Thank you.

278
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Thank you. Take your flowers back,
Theo. It didn't work.

279
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,400
Well, we can see a floating island
on the table that is high.

280
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,280
There is spun sugar. You got some
volume.

281
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,600
Nice work with the fruit.

282
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
It's colourful.

283
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,200
We have mango and pineapple compote,
raspberry compote.

284
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,240
Wrong choice of meringue. Italian
meringue, makes it very moussy.

285
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,720
You haven't got that gelatinous kind
of cooking.

286
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,600
The sugar content is too much
compared to the egg white,

287
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,840
so as a result it is very sweet.

288
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,520
However, if I ate it together with
the compote it sort of balances it.

289
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,720
The fruit element is nice.

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,040
Thank you very much, guys.

291
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
Cheers, thank you.

292
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,560
What went wrong with the sugar?

293
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
Left it too late. For me, it's
unfinished business.

294
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,080
Having said that, I like the fact
that you've done individual bowls,

295
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
but let's taste it.

296
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,480
We've added a touch of nougatine to
the sugar.

297
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,640
In the middle of your floating
island

298
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,920
you should have some cherry jelly.

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,520
I quite like your jelly that you
pipe into the meringue,

300
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,080
because people don't expect that and
when you cut through there's a nice

301
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
surprise in there.

302
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,840
I believe your egg whites are firm.

303
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,240
The sweetness is great.

304
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,840
Having said that, I would personally
have preferred something

305
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,440
a little bit more extravagant. You
know, you could have gone exotic.

306
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,680
It's not original enough, your
creation today.

307
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Thank you very much.

308
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,960
Yeah, not to do this BLEEP thing
again.

309
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,880
Romain, Leanne, no regrets with this
morning's challenge?

310
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
Um, I would have done it I think.

311
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,600
Well, it's far from the drama I was
expecting.

312
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,040
Not the most imaginative, I would
say, yeah?

313
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,280
We see little meringues,

314
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,840
which I don't mind if they are an
addition

315
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,080
to a beautiful floating island,

316
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,000
which I struggle to see at the very
bottom.

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,600
It's only the cube, the little cube.

318
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,560
Oh, so this is the only floating
island there is?

319
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,360
Yes, it was not coming out
of the mould,

320
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,760
so we had to get cute with what was
left, basically.

321
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,760
So you've got a rum and berry
compote.

322
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,440
It looks a little bit like
an Eton mess.

323
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,760
Flavour wise I like the compote to
go with it.

324
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,840
It's meringue and berries,
basically.

325
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,520
This is only two portions size.

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,120
We asked for six to eight.

327
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
You did not meet the brief.

328
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,080
We asked for a floating island,
you did not meet the brief.

329
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,800
Tomorrow I really want to see.

330
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,880
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, guys.

331
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
It is what it is. Fair enough.
Tomorrow, it's a nightmare.

332
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,560
It's not over until it's
over. Exactly.

333
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,440
OK, let's forget it and let's come
back tomorrow stronger.

334
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,000
We're not going to take the back
seat and say, oh, yeah,

335
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,440
we've nailed this one. Yeah, we've
definitely got a fight tomorrow.

336
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,480
Tomorrow's live plating extravaganza
requires more individual elements

337
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
than any showpiece that's come
before it,

338
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,920
so tonight's golden hour is a vital
chance to get ahead.

339
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,840
So today's secret recipe challenge
was a tough one,

340
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
I think it's fair to say.

341
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,480
Hilton Park Lane, how did they do?

342
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,520
I really enjoyed the father and son
partnership.

343
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
They both worked together so well.

344
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600
As we know Emanuel built Sam out of
cake and then he came to life as a

345
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,360
magic apprentice, so it makes sense.

346
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Darryl and Bharat, they've been
going from the bottom

347
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,880
to a very strong contender
to go to the final.

348
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,040
Both Hotel Cafe Royal
and Sweet Art Lab,

349
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,160
they are barely floating
at the moment.

350
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Pressure is on because they are
fighting for the final.

351
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,360
Morning.

352
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
Good morning, chefs.

353
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,800
We hope you've recovered from
yesterday's mission impossible,

354
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,840
because today, the judges have
decided to reinvent the showpiece
challenge -

355
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,760
and spoiler alert - they've not
made it any easier.

356
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,920
I mean, I've tried to say to them,
it's nearly the end of term,
can't we all just watch a video?

357
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,320
But that went down like a lead
souffle.

358
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,640
So, judges, would you be kind enough
to explain today's ordeal?

359
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
I mean - showpiece challenge?

360
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
Chefs, today, we would like you to
make the most spectacular cake you

361
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,240
have ever made, at least three tier.

362
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,800
The theme for today's challenge
is adventure.

363
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,440
So you must also create a further

364
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,360
12 components which you will then
plate up in front of us live.

365
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,960
Your performance needs to be
spectacular.

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,840
So chefs, you have four hours.

367
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,720
The time starts now.

368
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
OK, OK, OK.

369
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,600
The three tiered cake is the largest
cake they've ever been asked to make

370
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,360
for the competition.

371
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,440
It must be big enough to feed 40
people.

372
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
If someone normally said to me,

373
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
you had to go and do
a three-tiered cake,

374
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,440
you wouldn't have it ready
in four hours.

375
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
But that's not all.

376
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,440
There will be live plating as well,

377
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,080
so exciting and daunting
at the same time.

378
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,360
Live plating is where a spectacular
dessert is created

379
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
in front of your eyes.

380
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,040
This is showtime, live
plating, three tiered cake,

381
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,800
which they will have to prepare to
make it all work together and create

382
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,440
a great adventurous spectator.

383
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,720
This is gastronomic performance art
at its most decadent and dramatic.

384
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
I want to be surprised.

385
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,040
I want to see movement.

386
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,960
I want them to engage with me.

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,800
I want to see explosion
and firework on the table.

388
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
I expect nothing less than that.

389
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,120
Wow. They want it fitter,
give them fitter.

390
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,160
This is a presentation,
maybe Benoit.

391
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,120
Good morning to you.

392
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,560
Morning. How did it go?

393
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,280
We are so intrigued with what you're
going to come up with.

394
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,200
What's the story of your designs
today?

395
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,320
The story is like surviving,
surviving into a Jurassic world,

396
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,600
like dinosaurs.

397
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,880
This is a very risky challenge for
survivors like us.

398
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,080
So you bring your survival instinct.

399
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,440
Yes, every single challenge,
almost dead but still alive.

400
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,840
After a disappointing first day,

401
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
Sweet Art Lab's Hideko and Theo

402
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,360
hope their Jurassic experience
will save them from extinction.

403
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,480
It will feature sable biscuit bones,
dinosaur eggs and vanilla,

404
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,200
matcha and chocolate chiffon sponge
volcano cakes,

405
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,640
which will spew molten raspberry
lava and liquid nitrogen smoke.

406
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,760
That could be dangerous.

407
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,840
We're not going to be eating any
of this liquid nitrogen.

408
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,560
We're going to have to survive this
one, to be honest with you.

409
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,760
Super excited for this one.
Are you excited, Cherish?

410
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,200
I am super excited.

411
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,920
Are you going to have moving
dinosaurs? It won't be moving.

412
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,440
Are you going to be dressed as a
survivor?

413
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,480
You might be surprised.
You might be surprised!

414
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,120
Surviving this semifinal is also
a top priority

415
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,960
for Hotel Cafe Royal's
Leanne and Romain.

416
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,280
So they've taken inspiration from
the fearless spirit

417
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,520
of Indiana Jones.

418
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,560
You know, you always see an
adventure movie,

419
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,480
there's a wonky bridge,
kind of jungle bridge.

420
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,920
We're going to smash, like, some
boulders that are going to come
running down.

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,120
We're gonna use dry ice

422
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,680
to make a smoky effect at the end
of the journey.

423
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:13,080
In a bid to avoid the
Temple of Patisserie Doom,

424
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,560
they're navigating a treasure map
of crystallised chocolate grass,

425
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,080
chocolate soil and creme brulees.

426
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,880
Culminating in a three tier
chocolate cake filled with mango,

427
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:28,280
lime and vanilla compote and passion
fruit and mango ganache.

428
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,520
Balanced on the fourth cake is
their wonky bridge, from which their

429
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,560
boulders will descend.

430
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,880
Is that what you've done during
the golden hour?

431
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,880
This is what we've got to do today.

432
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,240
Golden hour is about the same.

433
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,600
Oh, my gosh.
We're going to tell a story.

434
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,400
OK. With our plating.

435
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,240
It's like a treasure map.

436
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,320
Treasure map. Wow.

437
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,840
What kind of strategy do you have
for today?

438
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,160
Everybody is running, that's the
strategy.

439
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,360
Running. We're going to push it.

440
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,720
Over at Hilton Park Lane they are
planning something a little more

441
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,160
relaxing and they have Sam's fiancee
Nicole to thank for it.

442
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,240
We're going sort of Caribbean-esque,

443
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,560
get me in the mood for when I
go to Barbados.

444
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:10,800
When I told her I was gonna do
the competition, I said,

445
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,040
I'll take you away afterwards.
Got to keep her sweet,

446
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,720
otherwise I'm not sure I'll have
anything to go back to.

447
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:20,320
Their tropical rainforest adventure
will feature lime caviar islands,

448
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,080
hibiscus meringue rocks
and chocolate coconuts.

449
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:29,480
And their three tiered cake will sit
on a giant chocolate stand

450
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,800
and cascade like a waterfall.

451
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,160
It will be filled with pina colada
flavours, coconut, rum, jelly,

452
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,480
pineapple jelly and coconut
cheesecake.

453
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,920
And they are serving up proper
pina coladas.

454
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,080
Got a bit of cocktail making.

455
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
You are planning a bribery,
basically.

456
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,560
Has anybody heard that word coming
from me?

457
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,040
It's part of the show,
it's entertainment.

458
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
I was teasing you, of course.

459
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,200
So is that going to be enough to
take you through to the final?
I certainly hope so.

460
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,640
It will. Yeah. Conviction.

461
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,280
Yes, definitely!

462
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,360
Yes, definitely.

463
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,920
When it comes to adventures,

464
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,640
Resort World's Darryl and Bharat's
idea of fun is a lot less exotic.

465
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,840
What's the theme? Call it the great
outdoors,

466
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,920
because I quite often go out
camping, without tents in the
winter.

467
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
Wow. You just go
with a sleeping bag?

468
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,600
Yeah, we'll make a shelter or
we'll just sleep under the stars.

469
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,120
I go camping. Do you?

470
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
Oh, ha-ha.

471
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,000
Their rugged camouflage cake will be
decorated with hibiscus flowers

472
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:40,640
and feature layers of hazelnut
sponge,

473
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:43,520
blackcurrant jelly and dark
chocolate mousse.

474
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,360
Their live plating elements of basil
gel and blackberry brulees should

475
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
evoke an expedition to the wilds
of Britain.

476
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,600
Is it going to get you through
to the final? I hope so.

477
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
Flavours and the look are
completely different, I think,

478
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,000
it has... Baked beans,
bacon? That's not a bad idea.

479
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,560
Sausages. Yeah, yeah.

480
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,760
The smell of a sleeping bag that's
been in a loft for too long.

481
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,720
Yeah. I've watched Countryfile.

482
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,920
The cake is ready.

483
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,640
I can build it. But with the time
limit on it,

484
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,080
it's not really that comforting.

485
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Three cakes to do.

486
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,480
So it's busy, busy, busy.

487
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,600
Definitely have to push.

488
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,040
Hopefully it won't take too long
to set.

489
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,440
But making the three tiered cake is
just part of the battle.

490
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
Chefs, you are halfway through.

491
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,080
So that's two hours left.

492
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,840
The teams have another mammoth task.

493
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,760
Creating the 12 live plating
elements.

494
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,040
This is mango puree, it looks like
a raw egg.

495
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,480
The more ambitious they are...

496
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,080
We'll crack one of these coconuts.

497
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,320
The more chance they'll have of
making it through to the final.

498
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Never have enough time here,
that is the problem.

499
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,480
The bridge is pretty much done.

500
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,680
Oh, oh.

501
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,640
But Leanne and Romain's adventure
has been stopped in its tracks.

502
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
BLEEP.

503
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,080
Rebuild the bridge, if I can.

504
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,920
Come on!

505
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,920
BLEEP.

506
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,720
Without a bridge, their blockbusting
performance

507
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,680
has no grand finale.

508
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,840
It will be a broken bridge.

509
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,240
Chefs, you have one hour left.

510
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
That's one hour!

511
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
Be careful with that.

512
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,520
While most of the teams can push on
constructing their gigantic

513
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,240
tiered cakes... I must say, it feels
quite tense.

514
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,040
A lot of pressure on us,
unfortunately, due to a lack of
time.

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,360
..Leanne and Romain are
battling to save their rickety
bridge,

516
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,800
the star attraction of their
extravaganza.

517
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,160
BEEP

518
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,320
It's melting in my hand.
So Romain and Leanne,

519
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,440
have noticed there was already a
couple of cracks.

520
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,040
But, hey, they are very focused.

521
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,200
And Hilton Park Lane, they are
making a huge chocolate stand.

522
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,760
Is the stand going to be brought to
life as well as the live plating?

523
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,120
Because he's focusing all his energy
on the stand.

524
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,920
But Benoit, what about the Resorts
World?

525
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
They are going camping somewhere in
the countryside. I love camping!

526
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,640
I've got a little concern.

527
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,840
What is it that you do with it to
make it special?

528
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,400
Will they go a little too safe?

529
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,000
And we've got Hideko and Theo -

530
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,520
the Jurassic World.

531
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,720
In the past, it's always good a
concept.

532
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
However, poor delivery.

533
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,480
I hope they're going to make it
today.

534
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
I need to push.

535
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,160
Come on! Hilton Park Lane, hi!

536
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,600
Is this going to be good enough to
get you to the final? Is this your
ticket to the final?

537
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,680
Cos we've got the final. That's what
we've got now.

538
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,880
I really do hope so. We're going as
much as we possibly can do in the
time frame.

539
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,320
It's tropical. What's your favourite
cocktail?

540
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,480
Porn Star Martini. A Porn Star
Martini?

541
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,920
Sam, that's not what I expected you
to say at all!

542
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,640
Chefs, you have half an hour left.

543
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800
There's a lot...

544
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,640
There's a lot to do. It's very
heated, isn't it?

545
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
It's got very tense today.

546
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,800
It's a place in the finals, though.
We want to see you do well.

547
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
So I need to do it now. Sorry, if
you don't mind.

548
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I have to. Oh! I have to.

549
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
I'm sorry. I have to.

550
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,240
The cakes, get in there.

551
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,920
Even if their cakes are coming to
life...

552
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,680
.unless they have all their live
plating props stood by, ready for
action,

553
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,000
their performance could still be a
flop.

554
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,480
Under pressure. Still got these to
ball up.

555
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,520
There's ice cream, warm chocolate
mousse, blackcurrant curd.

556
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,040
For the live plating.

557
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,640
Mango granita balls.

558
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,440
Hibiscus meringue. We wanted them to
look a bit like rocks,

559
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
so they're...

560
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,680
They're cracked. A lot to do.

561
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
It's now or never.

562
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,360
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

563
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,040
BEEP

564
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
These petals to decorate our cake.

565
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,320
BEEP

566
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,880
Can't get one out of that. They're
all stuck.

567
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,120
Quick! Come on, come on, come on,
come on!

568
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Emmanuel!

569
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
Emmanuel! I need some help.

570
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
The base wasn't flat.

571
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,800
It's wobbling like crazy.

572
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
I need you to hold that.

573
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,760
Went for a proper angle on that one.

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,440
I just need it to stick... Stop!

575
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,400
Stop moving the top! It's not
stick...

576
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,320
Watch where you put it on the cake
cos I don't want you to ruin the
whole...

577
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,800
Chefs, you have one minute left.

578
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
BEEP

579
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,920
Got a minute, mate!

580
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
Under pressure, of course.

581
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
BEEP

582
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
What a nightmare!

583
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,760
Push! Emmanuel!

584
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,480
Chefs, your time is up! Your time is
up!

585
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,280
Holy Moley!

586
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,040
I can't wait to see it in action.

587
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,400
Four stunning three-tiered cakes
and dozens of live plating elements,

588
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,560
all produced in five hours.

589
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,480
And now with a place in the final
at stake,

590
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,280
the stage is set.

591
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,200
Well, guys, let's get this show
on the road. Showtime.

592
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,960
This is our coconut. We're kind of
representing little islands.

593
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,680
Some lime and caviar.

594
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
Yellow from the mango.

595
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:39,840
Watermelon jellies.

596
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,000
White chocolate and vanilla.

597
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,360
Dragon fruit.

598
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,400
I help all of this
with some pina colada...drinks.

599
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,440
Woo!

600
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
Oh, my, my, my.

601
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,680
I love it, love it, love it.

602
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,840
And my bows to you.

603
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,800
Thank you. Wow. You make me feel
like I am actually suntanning now,

604
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,640
having my pina colada.

605
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:46,080
You've delivered a beautiful,
exotic display of dessert.

606
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,000
Cheers.

607
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,200
If you could serve us
perhaps a slice of your cake?

608
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,200
Got pineapple confit.

609
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,320
Got a coconut mousse.

610
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,280
I'm not too sure.

611
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,280
What is perhaps a bit disappointing
for me is in your cake,

612
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,200
which I was hoping to be truly pina
colada,

613
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,800
was more coconut than anything else.

614
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,080
However, all the elements that
you bring in really bind together.

615
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,080
I can't spot a mistake on the plate.

616
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,880
Thank you. Sante.

617
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
Cheers.

618
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,720
Well, we're gonna take us through
an adventure to the map

619
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,480
to actually find the treasure.
Take it away.

620
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,600
MUSIC: Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy
by Tchaikovsky

621
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,280
Chocolate crumbs.

622
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,320
Mango gel.

623
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,360
That's OK.

624
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,120
Woohoo!

625
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,760
I think it's good fun.
We had fun, didn't we?

626
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
Yes. OK.

627
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,080
I can continue, just like...

628
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,000
That part is fun.

629
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,280
But it's a little bit,
should I dare say, clumsy,

630
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,200
i.e. when we saw you caramelising
your creme brulee.

631
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,640
So much firing that you could
potentially melt the table down.

632
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
The cake is quite old-fashioned.

633
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,600
I was hoping that you'd bring
in something that is quite Zen,

634
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,360
something that is quite avant-garde,
because I know what you two can do.

635
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,280
Please, serve us a slice.

636
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,880
How I look at the cake
is how I'm eating now.

637
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,040
There's no firework.

638
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,840
There is only the zing
that is from the passion fruit.

639
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,640
There's no chitty bang.

640
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
Can I say chitty bang?
Chitty bang bang.

641
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,400
There's no chitty bang bang.

642
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,120
But the foam, the gels and
the granita refresh your palette.

643
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,560
The idea, intention,
I think, is great.

644
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,920
Thank you. Thank you for all
your effort. Thank you.

645
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,080
All about dinosaur.

646
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,880
So, yeah, it's surviving
in a Jurassic adventure.

647
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
MUSIC: The Blue Danube Waltz
by Johann Strauss II

648
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,640
The choreography, the smoke
that is bubbling away.

649
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,480
You own the stage today.

650
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,720
The Jurassic world meets
molecular astronomy.

651
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
Wow! You know, guys, you've got me
here.

652
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,200
I'm laughing my pants off.
Pants off?

653
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,400
But they are still on.
They're still on, they're still on.

654
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,360
I just hope your flavour profile
delivers.

655
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,880
I felt like I was eating egg.

656
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,800
However, it was a fruity element
that's inside there.

657
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,520
Really enjoyed eating it.

658
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,280
We've got the chiffon cake
with three flavours.

659
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,720
Vanilla, chocolate and the matcha.

660
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,600
Really take me back to my childhood

661
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,120
as how my mum make the chiffon
for me.

662
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,640
Thank you very much.

663
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,360
And I now really miss my mum.

664
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,720
The flavour combination within
the chiffon cake, I don't sense,

665
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
because there is so much acidity
on all your components.

666
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
Having said that,
I love your chocolate.

667
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,480
And the part I really enjoy,

668
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,120
actually,
the raspberry vinegar coulis.

669
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,040
So well done. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

670
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,440
Arigato.

671
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
Arigato.

672
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,840
It's the story of the outdoors.

673
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,600
Please, surprise us.

674
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:00,440
MUSIC: Flower Duet (Lakme)
by Leo Delibes

675
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:03,720
Redcurrant and basil gel.

676
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:09,520
Chocolate creme.

677
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,880
Warm chocolate mousse.

678
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,200
Chocolate spheres.

679
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:30,160
Blackberry brulees.

680
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,600
Chef, when you were telling me
about your camping,

681
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,240
I got all excited.

682
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,440
I was dreaming about barbecuing.

683
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,360
I was dreaming about horse
trotting around.

684
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,240
However, when I started to see how
you plate it, I get a bit deflated.

685
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,880
It's a bit disappointing.
You guys have been safe.

686
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,640
There might be more to come
in the cake.

687
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,720
We have a chocolate mousse, a
blackcurrant jelly, hazelnut sponge.

688
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
I enjoy eating your cake,

689
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,360
you know, with the chocolate,
the mousse that you put in,

690
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,840
but there's nothing to lit up
your cake and bring it alive.

691
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,880
The basil gel that you've got there
is on the money.

692
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:34,400
But you've chosen flavours
which are pretty delicate.

693
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:38,520
I'm not feeling wow
by what you've done.

694
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,520
If you are to move up
to the Grand Final,

695
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:45,800
you have to let it all out now.
Safe no more.

696
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,800
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Cheers, guys.

697
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,400
Cheers.

698
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,360
Can I have a pina colada?

699
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,000
I need it after that.

700
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,160
Based on both challenges,

701
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,520
Benoit and Cherish will now rank
the teams,

702
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,760
and only the top three will take
their place in the Grand Final.

703
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,000
We've done ourselves proud,
there's no doubt about it.

704
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,880
We've put all...everything into
that. Like, literally everything.

705
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:21,760
You wanna go through final,
of course, big-time.

706
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:26,000
The pressure is there.
And I think we are in danger.

707
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,640
I would love to get through.
It would mean everything, you know.

708
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,840
We've worked really hard to get
here. And it's the last step.

709
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:37,480
We could be only proud to say,
"Yeah, we made it to the final".

710
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,040
Like, definitely,
it would be something great.

711
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,120
Benoit and Cherish
have made their decision.

712
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:58,640
The team in first place had the best
day of their entire competition.

713
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,400
Congratulations...

714
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:08,160
Hideko and Theo from Sweet Art Lab,
you are through to the final.

715
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,120
In second place, the judges ranked

716
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,200
Emmanuel and Sam
from the Hilton Park Lane.

717
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:17,840
Congratulations, you're also through
to the final.

718
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,320
Which leaves Leanne and Romain
from Hotel Cafe Royal

719
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:27,320
and Darryl and Bharat
from Resorts World.

720
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,120
You guys just sort of helped me
to remember

721
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:30,800
why I got into baking
in the first place,

722
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:34,480
so whatever happens today,
you guys are awesome.

723
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,000
Benoit and Cherish agreed

724
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,200
that the team who'll be leaving
the competition

725
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,520
tonight are...

726
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,800
Leanne and Romain.

727
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,760
Gonna miss you. Gonna miss you, too!

728
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,840
You're always sad when you are
leaving this kind of competition,

729
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,600
especially now, when we are just
at the door to the final.

730
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,160
Congratulations. I know you're
leaving today,

731
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,680
but it's congratulations.
You came all the way to the
semifinal.

732
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,600
I'm just proud of...
Yeah, you should be.

733
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:16,440
I think it's changed us as people
in general.

734
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:19,800
Like, we've learnt
so much from doing it.

735
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,960
It's been a great experience.

736
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,520
I think the best bit...

737
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,960
The best day ever had!

738
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,080
Finally.

739
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,360
You did it. You did it. You did it.

740
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,040
BLEEP.

741
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:40,800
Are we allowed to use that?
Yeah, wicked. Absolutely.

742
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,880
Feel great. Yeah.

743
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,920
Amazing. Happy as Larry the lamb.

744
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,880
Hello? We're in the final!

745
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,200
SCREAMING FROM PHONE

746
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,880
Next time...
After much deliberation...

747
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,640
This should have been done
yesterday.

748
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,400
The judges have decided...

749
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:14,040
That the winners of Bake Off:
The Professionals 2018...

750
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,120
We're now running out of time.

751
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,640
Are...

752
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,400
Can you please not bang that table
so hard?

753
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,840
BLEEP.

754
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,320
Do you have what it takes to impress
Benoit and Cherish?

755
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,800

Hello and welcome to
Bake Off: The Professionals.

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,640
I can hardly believe it's the grand
final. Yes, after 10 weeks of

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,880
fierce competition,
stiff peaks and mirror glazes,

4
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,760
finally one team will be crowned

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,800
the best professional
pastry chefs in Britain.

6
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:14,120
Will it be Resorts World?

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,480
Will it be Hilton Park Lane?

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,040
Will it be Sweet Art Lab?

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,560
Only one mammoth challenge stands
in the way of the winner

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
being announced here in the Great
Hall of Firle Place in Sussex.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,840
Oh, I'm so excited.
Oh, I'm so nervous.

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,080
Oh, when I'm nervous,

13
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,920
to let out all my energy I always
do something physical. Like what?

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,440
Oh.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,080
Last time...

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,280
..a spectacular live
plating showdown...

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:40,760
Parachuting, zip wiring...

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,480
..saw Hideko and Theo of
Sweet Art Lab triumph.

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,640
You know, guys, you got me here.

20
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,040
But it was Leanne and Romain
of the Hotel Cafe Royale...

21
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,280
There is no cheeky bang.
Cheeky bang-bang.

22
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,800
..who just missed out on
a place in the grand final.

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,600
I'm going to miss you.
I'm going to miss you too!

24
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,000
Now the entire competition comes
down to one epic challenge...

25
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,000
Running out of time. Back!

26
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,400
..to decide the winners...

27
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,640
I'm not really sure.

28
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,280
..of Bake Off: The Professionals...

29
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:08,880
We are blown away with your concept.

30
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,520
This is wow!

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,520
..2018.

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,680
Can you please not bang
that table?

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm going to trip now.

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,040
Ah!

35
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,280
Disaster!

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,040
Can I have counselling after this?

37
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,920
After nine gruelling weeks, it all
comes down to the next two days.

38
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,600
Wait, wait, wait.

39
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,920
Representing the high-end
Birmingham hotel Resorts World,

40
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:45,800
Darryl and Bharat nearly went
out in an emotional first week.

41
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,040
Everything is just not
right in there.

42
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,880
DARRYL CRIES
Oh, man, it's all right.

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,360
But they have since shown
a dogged fighting spirit...

44
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,880
We will do it. We can do it!

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,320
..and flat for flavour.

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,360
I'll start doing a cha-cha-cha!

47
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,280
Ooh, it's beautiful.

48
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,400
This is crunch time, there might be
tears of joy tomorrow from me...

49
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,480
From him.

50
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,160
I've manned up.

51
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,560
Strawberries in there.

52
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,720
Is it straight? Yes.

53
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,240
From London's five-star
Hilton Park Lane,

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,240
Emmanuel and Sam have
delivered feasts for the eyes...

55
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,400
That is what I call a showpiece.

56
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,040
..if not always for the palate.

57
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,280
I'm not enjoying this.

58
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,120
But they have an undeniable
knack for the spectacular.

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,240
Coconut, pina colada.

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,960
CHERISH: I love it,
love it, love it.

61
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,640
I'm wearing my lucky socks
and I've made him go out

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,480
and buy some pink
and yellow socks as well.

63
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:37,720
He's got watermelons on his socks,
which is just madness.

64
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,520
Bespoke patisserie business
Sweet Art Lab have reached

65
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,680
the final on the crest
of a creative way.

66
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
The story is like Jurassic World.

67
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,680
But Hideko
and Theo's limitless imagination...

68
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,800
Wow!

69
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,520
..is not without risk.

70
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:03,160
Now, the wait is over.

71
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,560
Welcome back, finalists.

72
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,600
By the end of tomorrow, one of
you three teams will be crowned

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,240
winners of Bake Off:
The Professionals 2018.

74
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,120
All that stands in your way
is the challenge of doom.

75
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,520
You may well go into
patisserie meltdown.

76
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,080
Judges, what lies ahead?

77
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,240
We want you to produce
a lavish banquet

78
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,120
to serve at least 80 guests,

79
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,560
featuring a large
sculptural showpiece

80
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,320
and four different
types of desserts.

81
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:44,040
You will then have to serve
your desserts at a party

82
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,160
hosted by Lord and
Lady Gage in the Great Hall.

83
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,400
Fun fact, Lord Gage
is actually a Viscount,

84
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,760
and you know what that means?

85
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:56,360
He's literally descended
from a chocolate biscuit.

86
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
Cherish.

87
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,520
It must tell a story and reflects
your passion and personality.

88
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
So, teams, you have four
and a half hours today

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,600
and a further four and a half hours
tomorrow and your time starts now.

90
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,680
All right. Let's start.

91
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:13,760
This is it, the grand final.

92
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,440
They have to throw everything
they've got at this challenge.

93
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,560
They've got to come up with
what they feel defines them

94
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,160
as pastry chefs.

95
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,720
The chefs have to come up
with a showpiece

96
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,280
that leads down beautifully
to the dessert.

97
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,480
It needs to marry
with each other.

98
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:32,560
Tomorrow's lavish banquet
isn't the team's only deadline.

99
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,600
Yolk, cream cheese, whipping cream.

100
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:38,240
In just four and a half hours,
they'll be facing the judges.

101
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,440
At the end of today, they have
to produce two beautiful desserts.

102
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,400
We want to see a range of
flavour and textures

103
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,440
and what represents
their style the best.

104
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,440
Delivering exquisite desserts
while preparing elements

105
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,600
for tomorrow's awe-inspiring
centrepieces

106
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,440
will require a head-spinning feat
of teamwork and time management.

107
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,520
The first day is so crucial.

108
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:04,320
They need to be ahead of time or
on the second day they will suffer.

109
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,480
Morning, guys. This is it. This
is it. This is the final round.

110
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,120
What does it mean to you guys?

111
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,320
It means a lot, massive.

112
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,880
Can you believe the first round?

113
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,280
HE PRETENDS TO CRY

114
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,760
THEY LAUGH
Don't make me feel bad!

115
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,840
You had that little hiccup
at the beginning

116
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,720
and then since, consistency.

117
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,520
So, will you be able
to describe your banquet?

118
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
It's called End Party.

119
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,120
We're going to celebrate
with homages to things

120
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,240
that we've done in the contest.

121
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,960
There End Party will see
a separate giant chocolate

122
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,080
and sky-scraping sugar centrepiece,
including glitter ball,

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,080
balloons, a four-leaf clover

124
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,920
and other nods to
previous showpieces.

125
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,240
And Bharat's hoping to get
the party started

126
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,960
with a reinvented millefeuille
with yuzu cremeux

127
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,520
and gel-filled raspberries
sat on a blondie base.

128
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,000
What's a blondie?
It's like cousin to a brownie.

129
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,080
A cousin. Ah. It's done with
white chocolate.

130
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
Ah, a blondie and a brownie are...

131
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,760
OK, you always learn something new.

132
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,400
While Darryl and Bharat celebrate
their journey to the grand final...

133
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,200
Did you weigh that jelly
as 500, 500? Yeah.

134
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,640
..for Hilton's Park Lane
Emmanuel and Sam,

135
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,520
it's all about the relationship
that has got them here.

136
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,960
The theme is Entente Cordiale.

137
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,880
Entente Cordiale was an agreement
between English and French

138
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,840
to say they would support each
other.

139
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,280
The idea is as a team together,
English and French,

140
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,760
we're going to work together.

141
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,000
It's going to be obviously
very French and English.

142
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,520
Tom's going to excel himself
with some sugar work.

143
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,600
I want to do the best sugar
showcase I've ever done.

144
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,040
Ah. That's a big step.

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
That's called ambition
and a big statement.

146
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,040
Sam's spectacular sugar sculpture
will feature the Eiffel Tower

147
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,760
and Big Ben, flanked by
a chocolate Queen's Guard

148
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,320
and a champagne bottle.

149
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:42,680
Their first Franco-English dessert
will see a chocolate mousse finger

150
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,520
filled with blood orange jelly,

151
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,440
balanced on Sam's avant-garde base.

152
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,120
This is a brownie sponge, just
spreading some feuilletine on top.

153
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,440
It's a nice crunchy layer.

154
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,400
You'll have this as your base.

155
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,760
When it comes to Hideko and Theo's
theme, all is not what it seems.

156
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,200
All the dessert and all the display
is going to look like something

157
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,920
which it's not, more or less.
Something which it's not?

158
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,080
Yes, so you're not sure, like,
if it's a food.

159
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,840
Oh, so is there a risk that the
judges will start eating the table

160
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,760
cos they think it might be a
dessert? That's... That's a worry.

161
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,200
So, people go, "Is it a handbag
or is it a dessert?"

162
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,480
Is about right? That's it.
Yeah, exactly. That's it.

163
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,720
OK. Is it Theo or is it a dessert?

164
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,000
Hideko and Theo's
mind-bending display

165
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,080
will centre around a giant
chocolate S, for Sweet Art Lab,

166
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:28,560
a sugar work heart and an
ornate edible picture frame.

167
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,920
And their first dessert
is a citrus cheesecake

168
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
designed as an ice cream,

169
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,880
filled with saffron mousse
and a surprise fruit centre.

170
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,840
It's going to be for the
citrus compote.

171
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,160
Pink grapefruit, blood orange
and a lemon.

172
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,120
But the teams won't be able to
assemble a showpiece tomorrow...

173
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,760
I'm going to cast everything I can.

174
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,520
..unless they find time to begin
preparing their large sugar

175
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,400
and chocolate elements today.

176
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,640
So, now, this is essentially,
like, your golden hour.

177
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,880
It is, yeah.

178
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,040
It's going to be our presentation
table. Oh, I see.

179
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,920
Before you say it,
they're not kidney beans.

180
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,200
They're not kidney beans.
I thought they were jelly babies.

181
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,160
We've had a few comments about that.
LIAM LAUGHS

182
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:14,000
When it comes to getting things
set in time,

183
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,080
Sam has given himself
even more to worry about.

184
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,760
This is a blood orange jelly that
we're going to be putting inside

185
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,280
the milk chocolate and
blood orange finger.

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,920
It's a blood orange puree,
I've reduced it down

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,600
so it's just set, like,
just holds its shape,

188
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,560
which is what I wanted.

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,440
I think I might need the luck of the
socks today, that's for sure.

190
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,360
I was forced, obviously, to go
and buy a new pair of socks.

191
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,880
Father of three Emmanuel
has sacrificed more

192
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,800
than his normal socks
to get to the grand final.

193
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:44,320
I mention the competition too much?
Only a bit. Just...

194
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,680
Only a bit. Only a bit.

195
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:48,040
My family's been very
supportive, I have to say.

196
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,400
My wife's taken over my role
as much as hers in the family,

197
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,680
looking after my daughters.

198
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,400
We've spent so much time together
throughout this whole competition,

199
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,320
I think we've seen more of each
other than we have our misses.

200
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,680
It's been nice not see him as just
the boss and to see him as a friend.

201
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:05,240
Are we friends? Yeah, I suppose.

202
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,120
Their friendship will be cemented
in their second dessert,

203
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,000
a tropical take on a classic,

204
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,640
where Sam's favourite passion
fruit chocolate will coat

205
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:14,960
a very French financier sponge.

206
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,400
This is a financier mix.

207
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,560
Almonds, icing sugar,
flour and a burnt butter.

208
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,960
Beurre noisette is
how it's pronounced.

209
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,960
Working in big qualities is
something we're used to.

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,800
But preparing a banquet isn't it
a familiar task for all the teams.

211
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:33,040
It's definitely a big challenge
so everything has to be perfect.

212
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,800
Theo and Hideko are more
used to satisfying smaller,

213
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,200
bespoke requests.

214
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,480
Working for such a small company has
seen Theo struggle to believe that

215
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,800
they could compete with teams from
high-end hotels and restaurants.

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
Theo, for me, he always has been
a winner but he doesn't know it.

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Every week, he was calling me
and telling me,

218
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
"I'm not sure, I'm not sure."

219
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,440
And finally, it's already the
final, so I'm really proud.

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,880
I'm really proud of him.

221
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,960
And Theo's fiance has
inspired their second dessert,

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,840
transforming gianduja mousse,

223
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,360
mango and bergamot compote

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,360
and chocolate and hazelnut sable

225
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,880
into a ring finger.

226
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,480
For his second dessert,
Darryl is taking a huge risk.

227
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,160
I'm not allowed to eat any nuts,

228
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,280
so I'm going to make
a lovely hazelnut caramel.

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
Just a danger seeker.

230
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,760
Life on the edge.

231
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,720
Before Darryl became a chef,
danger was never far away.

232
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
It was quite a difficult youth.

233
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,440
I was OK up to about 11 when my
mum passed away and, unfortunately,

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,600
I left home at 16 and it kind
of went downhill from there.

235
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
In and out of trouble with the
police, extremely dark time,

236
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
until I met my wife Hannah
and then cheffing.

237
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,840
He worked and worked and worked,
then calmed down with his ways

238
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,280
and it was nice to move down here

239
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,600
and get away from all the nonsense.

240
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,720
Really proud of him and
the boys think he's fantastic.

241
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Darryl's journey is celebrated
in his second dessert,

242
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,920
a travel bar made with

243
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,600
chocolate ganache mousseline

244
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,280
and a lightly salted hazelnut
caramel that takes us

245
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,400
right back to the start
of his trip to the grand final.

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,240
It's the bar that I did to
get into this competition.

247
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
I took it from Birmingham to
London without them breaking

248
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
and they travelled really well.

249
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,760
Bharat, do you want to just
taste this quick?

250
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
Yeah. Quick, quick, quick.

251
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,040
Salt-wise.

252
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,600
Yeah, it's good. Good? Yeah.

253
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,920
Chefs, you have one hour left.

254
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,800
That's one hour. What did he say?
One hour, OK? Yep.

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,520
One hour, Hideko. Thank you.

256
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,720
How many? An hour. Have we? BLEEP.

257
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,280
I might need a hand
just to build these. Sure.

258
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,960
Desserts that need to set...

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
Jelly in the blast? Yeah.

260
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,040
..have to be in the freezer
as soon as possible.

261
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,480
This is for the finger, I'm
piping the mousse into the mould.

262
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,040
Any delay now will mean
less time to glaze

263
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,400
and add detail before
the first judging.

264
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
These are the travel bars.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
I need to seal these off and
then put them in the freezer.

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Time waits for no man.

267
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,640
# It's getting hot in here. #

268
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,560
But Theo is already falling behind.

269
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,680
I'm making them. OK.

270
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
Still quite a lot of to do.

271
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,200
His fingers might be
in the freezer...

272
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,640
..but he's yet to even start
his ice cream illusions.

273
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,680
The cheesecake next, please. OK.

274
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
Yeah.

275
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,080
Half an hour, chefs.
You've got half an hour left.

276
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,920
This is a white chocolate
and raspberry blondie.

277
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,560
It's all about accuracy, otherwise
the layers won't look right.

278
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,080
They're set, that's the main thing.

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,520
Just cutting one of the ends off
because they're really big.

280
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,920
Just a single example of each
dessert will be scrutinised

281
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
by the judges...

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,480
It's a caramel chocolate
with puffed rice.

283
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,400
It just gives another texture.

284
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,080
..meaning detail is
more important than ever.

285
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,240
I'm doing the shiny glaze
for the finger.

286
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,480
I'm going to put some of the
yuzu curd just between there

287
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,040
so every sort of layer's getting
something. Pushing on now.

288
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,400
I can see one dessert there,
how's the other one going?

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,960
It's going.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,040
Sam!

291
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,240
You're not going to get a lot
from Sam. It's going, but going...

292
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
..correctly? Er...

293
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
We'll see in about
10 minutes' time.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,240
Going to do a little decoration
for the bar,

295
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,000
brush some gold shimmer on.

296
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,760
24-BHARAT gold.

297
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,360
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left.

298
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
Right, add that to the cast.

299
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,200
So, we've still got glaze
to make for tomorrow.

300
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,120
The desserts are
going to be up there.

301
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm trying to at least push to get a
little bit of decoration done.

302
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,320
Very intense. Four and a
half hours have just gone so fast.

303
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,040
The sugar being cooked makes a world
of difference for me tomorrow,

304
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
otherwise I would've been
fighting the whole day.

305
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,960
I wish I have more done today.

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,400
You think you can get that done
in time? I have to.

307
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,560
I don't have time.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
Chefs, you have one minute.

309
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,680
My goodness.

310
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
Plate. You got 'em.

311
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,640
More?

312
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,760
Chefs, please step away
from your workbenches.

313
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,160
Your time today is up.

314
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,960
That was tough.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,840
So you're going to be on it
tomorrow, have to be on it.

316
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,160
Tomorrow will be tough. Yeah?

317
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,320
The first two of each team's four
desserts for tomorrow's final

318
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,120
banquet will now be
judged by Cherish and Benoit.

319
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,560
Theo and Hideko, please
bring your desserts to the table.

320
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,760
It looks like a little flowerpot,
to be honest with you,

321
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,720
as opposed to an ice cream cone, but
I see the idea.

322
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,920
Is the cone edible?

323
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,320
It's edible
but it's not part of the dessert.

324
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
Citrus cheesecake outside

325
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,880
and saffron mousse and a
citrus compote.

326
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,400
I really like the mousse, I think,
it's really light.

327
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,600
However, I was craving for more
textured to excite my palate.

328
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,160
Because this is no longer
what I thought it was,

329
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,040
then this becomes soft.

330
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,640
And the saffron contaminates
everything around.

331
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,200
The whole lot tastes of one thing.

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
And remind me again,
this is supposed to be a finger?

333
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,720
It's very neatly done.
The glaze, it was nicely finished.

334
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,160
So this is a chocolate and hazelnut
sable, bergamot and mango compote

335
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,480
and then a milk chocolate
mousse with a milk chocolate glaze.

336
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
BLEEP great. Sorry!

337
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,280
I really, really, really, really,
really, really, really love this.

338
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,280
Mango and bergamot,
the flavour, I really loved.

339
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,360
When you eat it,
it's not over-sweet.

340
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,560
In terms of texture, this excites me
more than your cheesecake.

341
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
It's a nice piece of pastry.

342
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,880
Thank you. Thank you very much.

343
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,160
Well done, guys!

344
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,880
It's a hazelnut treble bar.
It looks very appetising.

345
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,280
It's sleek. I like the fact that
you've added

346
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,000
a partly sprayed top

347
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,760
and a gourmand glaze at the bottom.

348
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,440
It's a light chocolate panache,

349
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,320
a hazelnut caramel with a touch of
salt,

350
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,480
with caramelised puff rice.

351
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,600
You are working here with flavour
I don't like.

352
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
But I love.

353
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,960
ALL: Oh!

354
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,520
That little pinch of salt is
lifting the caramel flavour.

355
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,320
This is wow.

356
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
I really like it
because of the puffed rice.

357
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,240
There is a crispy sensation
that I'm eating.

358
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,520
Can taste the saltiness
of the chocolate balanced very well

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
with the mousse and the crunch.

360
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,040
Okay, we've got the next one.

361
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,520
Visually, it's a
cut piece of blondie.

362
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
Just sliced like this,
some raspberries.

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,320
HE SIGHS

364
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,760
It's been done too many times -
this is the final, guys.

365
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,120
It's a take on a mille-feuille.

366
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
It's a white chocolate and raspberry
blondie,

367
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
with raspberries and white chocolate
and yuzu cremeux.

368
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,560
In terms of flavour profile,
that little yuzu cream, very acidic.

369
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,560
The only nice part here
is your blondie at the bottom.

370
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,920
It was beautiful texture,
sweet and this was nice.

371
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,440
I expect more than what you have
displayed for us.

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,920
However, this one piece that we
really enjoy eating.

373
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
I loved it.

374
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,520
Well done. Thank you. Thank you.

375
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
From the first glance,
it looks alright.

376
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,120
But when I look closer,
I expect it to be cleaner.

377
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
And then when I saw you chop
off the other piece over here,

378
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
it just let me
feel that it was incomplete.

379
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,920
It's the finishing touches,
it's been rushed.

380
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,800
We have a Florentine base,
a milk chocolate mousse

381
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,200
with a blood orange jelly in
the middle.

382
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,320
Lovely textures at the bottom.
The crunchiness there is beautiful.

383
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
The part I don't love
is the blood orange.

384
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,200
Is it meant to be that liquid? We
expected it to kind of be runny
when...

385
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
Ah, but it's not running,
it's flown away.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,760
Okay, there is another dessert.

387
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,200
Again, I would say this is a pastry
which is a little bit rushed.

388
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,000
It's a very simple design, so for
that it needs to be very sleek

389
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,720
and the precision here is not
quite there yet for me.

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,440
The almond financier has been
dipped in passion chocolate.

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,120
Inside, you've got a passion
and mango compote, and then on top

392
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,280
is the mascarpone cream piped
in a Mandarin and vanilla jelly.

393
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,200
When I eat it as individual
components, I like it.

394
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,760
But when I eat it as a whole,
it's quite dry.

395
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,880
You've got seven different elements.
I think you've got too many.

396
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,760
I've got a passion fruit,
dominant flavour.

397
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,320
But it's uninteresting. Thanks for
your effort, team.

398
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
Thank you. Thank you.
Tomorrow is another day.

399
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,080
Yeah! After that.

400
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,040
We had a tough morning.

401
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,680
I don't know if it's lack of
planning or hoping to do too much.

402
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,480
Good comment today,
feel really good.

403
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
4.5 hours just gone!

404
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,960
Still everything has to be done
tomorrow, everything.

405
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
The trophy is in
reach of our hands now

406
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,240
but we've really got a push
tomorrow.

407
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,240
It's the last
day of the competition.

408
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
In just a few hours,
one of these teams will be crowned

409
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,600
the winners of Bake Off:
The Professionals 2018.

410
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,880
Is it fair to say that the
teams are evenly balanced at this
moment in time?

411
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,080
I have to say that it
is very, very close.

412
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,720
Darryl and Bharat,
their treble bar was delicious.

413
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,280
Without a shadow of a doubt,
the best dessert so far.

414
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,520
The sweethearts of Sweet Art Lab.

415
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,400
After seeing in the semi-final what
Hideko can do for her

416
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,600
live plating,
I am expecting even more now.

417
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
Sam and Emmanuel, he did not
achieve as much as he wanted to.

418
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
There was something missing.

419
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,040
But they always bounce back, those
guys, so everything is to play for.

420
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,560
I wonder who's going to win
that cash prize.

421
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,680
They can really enjoy spending that
money. Bruv, there's no cash prize.

422
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,200
There's no money?! No.

423
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,920
Why are they doing it?

424
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
Idiots.

425
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,840
I'm joking.

426
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,000
The teams now have
just 4.5 hours to complete

427
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,560
the batches of their first two
desserts judged yesterday,

428
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,840
and create batches of two
new desserts.

429
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,800
Plus construct their giant
showpiece banquets

430
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,480
for the judges and Lord and
Lady Gage's party.

431
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
Tense, nervous.

432
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Hopefully it will
fall into place. Or it won't.

433
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,600
It's a massive day. Last
chance to... So little time. Yeah!

434
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,280
It's the final -
it has to be stressful!

435
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,200
Resorts World, it's the last day!

436
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,840
How are you doing?

437
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,520
I think we're a little bit behind.

438
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,240
Simply because I didn't get these
casted yesterday. Up against it.

439
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,480
Could you please take us
through your dessert?

440
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,400
Yes, it will be a chocolate
petit gateau.

441
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,320
On top of chocolate sable biscuit,

442
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,680
Darryl will place a fluted dome of
chocolate mousse

443
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,080
with an orange Victoria
sponge filled with an ingredient

444
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,880
that has been key to their journey
through the competition.

445
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,440
A bit of added flavour
and some mandarin gel.

446
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,160
You like your mandarin,
don't you? Yeah.

447
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,080
You've used that before,
have you? We did.

448
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,480
Cherish,
what is Mandarin for mandarin?

449
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,240
Hwa-yu. Hwhy-you?

450
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,880
Hwa... Hwa.

451
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,240
Yu. Yu.

452
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,680
Tha's it! Hwa-yu.

453
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,800
BENOIT: I've got no clue
what your talking about.

454
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,400
What is Mandarin in French?
Mandarin. See, boring.

455
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,880
Straightforward.

456
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,720
After a disappointing first day...

457
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,600
I'm getting the meringues ready.

458
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,120
..Emmanuel and Sam are now
pinning their hopes of winning

459
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,640
the competition on some
of their favourite flavours.

460
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,160
I think I've made it quite clear
that I'm a great fan

461
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,280
of pistachio and raspberry.

462
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,800
Emmanuel's spheres will see
pistachio buttercream combined with

463
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:19,720
crisp citrus meringue and a
raspberry and calamansi confit.

464
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,400
All coated in a red
layer of powdered biscuit.

465
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Raspberry confit is going in the
middle.

466
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,720
Meringues looking good.

467
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,120
Uh...

468
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,720
We'll see. A bit more.

469
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,320
Capable of telling
you in about an hour, 1.5 hours.

470
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,400
While Hilton Park Lane and
Resorts World

471
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,000
rush to complete dome desserts...

472
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,040
It's good, yah?

473
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,720
..Over at Sweet Art Lab,
they are spending time transforming

474
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,360
their dome dessert into a main
course.

475
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,040
Hideko's trickery continues with
burger bun-shaped

476
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,320
domes of passionfruit chocolate
mousse filled with macadamia

477
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,960
nut burger brownies, topped with
white chocolate ganache cheese

478
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,280
and an apple and strawberry salad.

479
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:04,320
So, are we supposed to eat like
that, or are we supposed to...

480
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,400
Um... It's up to you. Over here, you
never have a knife and fork, you
go...

481
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,640
That's the whole point of having
the buns is to hold it up, no?

482
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,080
Yes, if you want to!

483
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,360
Apparently Lord and Lady Gage love
burgers. Uh, yeah. And kebabs.

484
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,560
Yeah, I... They love going to
kebabs shops.

485
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,960
As well as finishing huge batches

486
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,160
of all four of their banquets'
desserts...

487
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,600
I want to get them out of the way

488
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,760
and then I can spend as much
time as possible on the sugar work.

489
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:31,160
Between them, the teams now have
over 200 individual showpiece

490
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,520
components to complete.

491
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,520
So there's casting
and all the pulling to be done.

492
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,040
Blowing
and then there's chocolate work.

493
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,720
So you've got the champagne bottle,
you've got... Oh, is that a lion?

494
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,280
That is a lion. Well done. Yeah,
yeah. Yeah, that's two out of two.

495
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
What's the third one?
And then you've got, like,

496
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,800
the people that stand in the boxes
outside the Queen's house.

497
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,320
Yeah, that's the one.
What are they called? Guards.

498
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,720
I thought they had a posher name.

499
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
They might well do, I'm not sure.

500
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm not really confident with sugar,
so...

501
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,320
Theo's second attempt at a romantic
centrepiece will feature

502
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,400
hearts made from poured sugar.

503
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
Casting it now.

504
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,600
And the giant diamond
set in a display of gold cast sugar.

505
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,400
I tried to make a heart-shape
out of the pipe.

506
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
Bharat is doing
the chocolate ring.

507
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,280
The showpiece will be
sitting behind the sugar showpiece,

508
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,120
with balls, flowers. It will take
about 45 minutes to an hour to set.

509
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,080
Chefs, you've had an hour.
You now have 3.5 hours left.

510
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,640
That's an hour's gone already.
I know. BLEEP.

511
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,360
This should have been done
yesterday.

512
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,920
If delivering 80 desserts and all
the elements for a spectacular

513
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,880
showpiece wasn't demanding enough...

514
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,080
..Hideko is attempting to do
both at the same time.

515
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,280
Her final dessert will be
disguised as part of her showpiece.

516
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,920
Her ornate milk chocolate picture
frame will contain chocolate mousse,

517
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,120
hazelnut sable biscuit,
popping candy and a passionfruit

518
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,200
and yuzu salted caramel.

519
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,360
In the final push for the title,

520
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,800
Hideko isn't the only one
willing to deceive.

521
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,040
I've got the jelly with the anglaise
to go inside the cake.

522
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,640
Exactly like an entremet.

523
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,760
Emmanuel's layers of wild strawberry
jelly and creme anglaise will be

524
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,040
surrounded by a French Mara des Bois
strawberry and lime mousse,

525
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,240
set in the shape of a cushion to
bear the crown jewels,

526
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,160
for a final entremet showroom
dessert

527
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,320
that brings their showpiece theme
together.

528
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,920
It's quite close to heart. We have a
strawberries and cream cake,

529
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
and I was a ballboy at Wimbledon
when I was younger.

530
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,360
Also, the royal cushion,
my dad works in Buckingham Palace,

531
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,880
so another connection there.

532
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,680
While the banquets and themes
for both Hilton Park Lane and

533
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,120
Sweet Art Lab are starting to come
together, for Darryl and Bharat...

534
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,720
What's it like? Still a bit soft.

535
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
..The journey to their end party
seems to be getting longer.

536
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,960
I don't want to move that's
because...

537
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,240
Bharat's chocolate ring
still hasn't set,

538
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,320
and it is also his job to
complete their final dessert.

539
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,600
So I'm just stamping
out my lemon shortbread.

540
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,880
Which is going to be
the base for the mango bavarois.

541
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,720
On each of Bharat's lemon
shortbreads will sit

542
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,280
white chocolate glazed spheres of
mango bavarois,

543
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,280
filled with a passionfruit jelly

544
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,840
and a mango and passionfruit
compote.

545
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,760
I think this will have a few
more textures

546
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,120
and flavours that they might enjoy.

547
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,720
It's balls, bowls, balls.

548
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,440
Chefs, you are halfway through
your final challenge!

549
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
Whoops. Sorry, man.

550
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,920
A lot, a lot to do. Running out
of time. Plenty, plenty to do here.

551
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,000
I'm going to have to stop chocolate
decoration to get on with

552
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,160
cake finishing in a minute.

553
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,920
I'm just casting the Big Ben
and the Eiffel Tower

554
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,800
so they can get cooling down in time
to be able to use.

555
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,080
Feels like the list is
getting longer.

556
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,280
I'm doing some balloons,
some ribbons.

557
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,360
Hopefully a swan that will come
round with a hat

558
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,960
and a little shamrock.

559
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,720
Darryl set himself the challenge
of using five different

560
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,520
types of sugar to create over 30
separate elements.

561
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,840
Still not set. Eh? Still not set.

562
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
But the heat given off by such
a large quantity of molten

563
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,840
sugar may not be helping
Bharat's chocolate.

564
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,640
It's just heating up the room,
you see. Which we don't want.

565
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,560
Pushed us back about half an hour,
probably.

566
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,800
I mean, an minute's a long time.

567
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,120
And they're not the only team
beginning to lose precious minutes.

568
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,200
The components for Theo's
romantic centrepiece have

569
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,720
cracked during cooling.

570
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,520
Sugar is really not my thing.

571
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,920
Done once,
twice in this competition.

572
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,280
And now there is no time
to recast them.

573
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,160
Supposed to do a heart but I'm not
sure we're going to do a heart now.

574
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,600
Disaster.

575
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
90 minutes left to win Bake Off -
The Professionals.

576
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,480
You OK? Yeah.
Doesn't look how it should be.

577
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,480
While Theo has been forced to
simplify his romantic sugar
showpiece...

578
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,400
I'm annoyed, yes.

579
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,400
..for Sam,
simplicity is not on the menu.

580
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,120
I'm attempting to do one the most
complicated drips I've ever done.

581
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,840
For the first
time in the competition,

582
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,800
he is attempting to blow thin sugar
tubes and fold them

583
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,320
together to form
three-dimensional ribbons.

584
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,880
I think we're trying to go the
extra mile with every round.

585
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,440
By now, we've done quite a few
miles.

586
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,520
But Darryl and Bharat's ambitions...
Good ribbon.

587
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,840
..to combine their largest-ever
volume of sugar work... Oh, yes!

588
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,680
..with a huge chocolate showpiece...
Do you have any fans?

589
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,600
..doesn't appear to be
getting any closer

590
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,040
and they're running out of time.

591
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,880
The team's friends and families have
began arriving at Lord

592
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,760
and Lady Gage's party,
along with a few familiar faces.

593
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,920
It feels really great to be back.

594
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
Yeah, it feels really good,

595
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
cos you're not under
pressure or nothing.

596
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,600
I feel a little exposed now,

597
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,360
and people can see how
bad my fashion sense is!

598
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,960
THEY LAUGH

599
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,160
For Sam, it's been so hard for him.
He's never at home.

600
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
He's always practising.

601
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,040
We'd love to see him
a bit more than we have done,

602
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,120
but we're amazingly proud of him.

603
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,560
Theo is so into it.

604
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,520
Like, he gave, he gave himself,
like, totally.

605
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,440
He's just practising and everything.

606
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,640
When he comes home, he's so tired.
He's so, so tired.

607
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
He just wants to go to sleep.

608
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,000
Yes, he says, "I want to go to
sleep. I want to sleep!

609
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
I think my dad's got a good
chance of winning.

610
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,160
Chefs, you have one hour left to
complete your banquets.

611
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,120
Do you feel all right, Lauren?
Er, still a few things to do.

612
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,760
Your time's ticking, though.
What about your...?

613
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Yeah, I'll check it now.

614
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,640
In this final hour,

615
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,320
the teams must construct the largest
showpieces they've ever designed...

616
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,920
The ribbons are done.
The tubes are done.

617
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,560
Everything's been moulded.
The balloons is the next one.

618
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,320
..and put the finishing
touches to 240 deserts.

619
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,920
This is enough.

620
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
This is the mango bavarois.

621
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,920
Hideko? Yes? Did you make the onions
that I asked for? Sorry, no.

622
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
HE SIGHS

623
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,320
I just wanted to give them
a bit more colour.

624
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,640
I've done England.
Now I want to do a France balloon.

625
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,080
Hopefully, this will get us
some bonus points from Benoit.

626
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,240
I've got to still
assemble my flowers on here now.

627
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,960
I'm making a wee bird.

628
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,760
That's the Eiffel Tower.

629
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
This is the Big Ben.

630
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,080
This is the bit I dislike most.
It is like being a vet, to be fair.

631
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,720
If I build too late, it's not going
to set.

632
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
If I build piece by piece slowly,
as I'm making the flowers,

633
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,360
cos rushing a build is always a
risk.

634
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,440
Once I've pulled all of these, I
can get on with building.

635
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
I need two of these, though.

636
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,360
I'm working on the finish
of the champagne bottle.

637
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
Well, hopefully,
we won't be drinking from this one,

638
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,760
but we'll be drinking another one!

639
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,080
Whatever happens, I'll be drinking!
How long have we got left?

640
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,640
Chefs, that's just half an hour
left on your final challenge!

641
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,760
30 minutes.
No way we can use this now.

642
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
No time.

643
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
Bharat has run out of time to
complete his chocolate centrepiece.

644
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,280
The success of their final banquet
now rests on Darryl's sugar work.

645
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
How's it going?

646
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,640
You have to do this without
breaking the actual cast itself,

647
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,200
cos that would be a calamity.

648
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,760
A calamity! I like that word.

649
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,640
The sugar, representing the ice
cubes.

650
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
It's got to balance.

651
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
15 minutes. Ah!

652
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
Dry mouth!

653
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,520
Here goes France.

654
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,440
Nothing I can do about it, except
try and do another one.

655
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,440
If this balloon stays like it is, it
was better than the first one,
anyway.

656
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,360
It's making me nervous.
The whole thing's make me nervous.

657
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
That's moving.

658
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
It's moving.

659
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,440
BANGING
Can you please not bang that table
so hard?

660
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,800
Mm? Can you stop banging the table?

661
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,600
Sorry. Stay.

662
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
BANG

663
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
BLEEP

664
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,080
HE SIGHS

665
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
Carry on, carry on.

666
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
INDISTINCT

667
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,680
That's that.

668
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,880
Oh, no! Darryl and Bharat's
showpiece has just dropped.

669
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,120
However much you want to win this,
it's gutting.

670
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,280
Darrell, what just happened?

671
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,000
It's just not had the time to set.

672
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,920
But do you know what, though?
You guys are still continuing
with these lot,

673
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,880
and I feel like that's
the main thing. Keep going.

674
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,160
Don't worry about it. Yep.

675
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
BLEEP

676
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,520
Chefs,
you have five minutes left now.

677
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,280
This and this,
they're like diamonds.

678
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,760
I want to get some leaves on there.

679
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,440
The showpiece really needs
a little bit of green.

680
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,000
It's really crunchy underfoot.
It's not very nice sugar.

681
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
SHE GASPS

682
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,520
SHE BLOWS

683
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,120
Wow! I cut it off.

684
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,920
Can I have counselling after this? I
think we're going to need it.

685
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,280
You have one minute left.

686
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,680
No, Sam. Forget this one. All right.
I think it adds to it a lot.

687
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,160
Teams, that's your time up.

688
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,720
Congratulations, everyone.

689
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,320
You've completed your final
challenge.

690
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,440
Well done. I'm sorry, man.

691
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,440
Oh, well, you know...
Not enough time.

692
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm sorry, mate.

693
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,480
# Una furtiva lagrima... #

694
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,040
Three showpiece banquets
for 80 people

695
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,360
in just nine hours.

696
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,440
Did you see what...?
No, I didn't see it.

697
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,600
Just heard the noise, it reminded
me of when ours fell down. Mm-hm.

698
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,560
I'm sure it was beautiful, as well.
Oh, yeah, no doubt about it.

699
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,680
I know he was going...he
was going very high.

700
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,600
I'm moving back to Bangladesh.

701
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,360
Cherish and Benoit will now judge
each team's final showpieces

702
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,560
and taste their remaining
two desserts.

703
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,200
You rested all your elegant
structure, all that effort,

704
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,200
all that work, it was
beautiful, it was elegant,

705
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,960
on a little glueing, no bigger
than this, at the very base.

706
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,720
We can see where it broke.

707
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,920
You need to make sure you understand
where your pressure points are.

708
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
So it's unfortunate.

709
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,160
Are you all right?

710
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,240
You OK? You OK? Yeah.
SHE SNIFFLES

711
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,680
I just feel so sad for them.

712
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,160
Sorry.

713
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,440
HE EXHALES

714
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,120
You all right? Yeah. Yeah. Bon?

715
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,800
It's not just about the showpiece.
Now, it's about the dessert.

716
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,640
It's a Mandarin petit gateau.

717
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
It has a Mandarin gel,
an orange sponge

718
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,040
and a chocolate Sable biscuit,
surrounded by scented orange mousse.

719
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,680
Well, in terms of the design,

720
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,920
the glaze was a little bit
on the thin side.

721
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,440
Quite a few of those desserts

722
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,280
haven't got the glaze
all the way. Yeah.

723
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,240
Quite like the chocolate profile
with the orange.

724
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,400
They marry together very well.

725
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,280
The Sable is far too thick,
and not short enough,

726
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
which makes it very
difficult to cut.

727
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,160
It's a mango bavarois with a
passion fruit jelly and fresh mango

728
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,120
and passion fruit, finished with
a lemon shortbread at the bottom.

729
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,080
Visually, it's pretty simple,
but nicely glazed.

730
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,720
Sometimes, when it is simple,
it looks really elegant.

731
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,800
Simple design on the outside,
simple design on the inside.

732
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,560
But clean flavour.
The mousse has a beautiful texture.

733
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,040
And then with the compote,

734
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,760
the acidity just kicks in straight
away and they balance very nicely.

735
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,440
Very good effort in everything
that you have done.

736
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,760
Well, guys, it's been emotional!
It has. Thank you very much.

737
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,720
BOTH: Yes, thank you.
Thanks very much. Thank you. Cheers.

738
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,560
Cried at the start and at the end.

739
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,240
THEY LAUGH

740
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,440
This looks mad! Insane.

741
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,080
Wow.

742
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,280
You made use of every second.

743
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,360
It was such a joy to
watch both of you work.

744
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,520
And I really like the
crystal ball as your base.

745
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,440
Really liked the little lion.
It reminds me of Trafalgar Square.

746
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,560
It all binds together really nicely.

747
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,080
I really like the colour scheme.
It is the entente cordial.

748
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,480
The little technique of the blown
sugar ribbon

749
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,200
is not something you see often.

750
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,960
Very technically
challenging to do.

751
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,680
And you can recognise the symbols
which bring your story to life.

752
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,560
But it isn't the dessert.

753
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,360
We would like to taste the
raspberry and pistachio sphere.

754
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,760
You will see a red biscuit cuillere
to cover the pistachio buttercream.

755
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,480
Inside, you've got citrus meringue.

756
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
To finish with, you will
find some raspberry confit.

757
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,120
The finishing touch,

758
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,480
I'd like it to have a little bit
more finesse and high finish.

759
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,600
Personally, I really like
pistachio and raspberry.

760
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,680
I really like when you add in
the zest into your meringue.

761
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,280
I taste the pistachio.

762
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,360
I think the buttercream
is actually quite light.

763
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,800
But it's still a buttercream,
so that means a lot of butter.

764
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,600
When you eat it all together,
you've got a sensation of richness

765
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,480
in sugar and in fat.

766
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,760
So it's a little bit of an
old-fashioned kind of dessert.

767
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,920
I like the fact that you've decided
not to stick to one style,

768
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,160
so you have more of a sharing
dessert on this occasion.

769
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,280
So you've got strawberry
and lime mousse,

770
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,520
strawberry jelly with
fresh strawberries,

771
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,480
vanilla anglaise, vanilla sponge
and the bottom is a feuilletine.

772
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,600
It's quite elegant.
The layer is quite even.

773
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
I like some of the texture.
You've got the lovely sponge

774
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,600
and then the crunchy feuilletine
at the bottom.

775
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,680
I like the mousse texture,
quite creamy on my palate

776
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,240
and it's quite clean for me.

777
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,600
And then, as for the jelly,
it just melts completely,

778
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,360
and I can still taste
the fresh strawberry.

779
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
It's really pleasant to eat.
BOTH: Thank you.

780
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm looking forward to dinner!

781
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,120
THEY LAUGH

782
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,320
You are trying really hard to
push the boundaries

783
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,400
of what is possible
within patisserie.

784
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,040
A lot of fun is there.

785
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,040
We are always blown away
with your concept.

786
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,920
Is that a lavish banquet?

787
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,880
I'm not too sure.

788
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,800
And the sugar strand is a little
bit on the simplistic side.

789
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,240
Will you be able to serve your
dessert? Yes.

790
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,280
Would you like cheese?
This is to add to the burger...

791
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,840
LAUGHTER

792
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,480
Some ketchup? Would you like cheese?
Yes. Oh, yes, please.

793
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,880
Outside the burger bun is made up
of passion fruit chocolate mousse

794
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,080
and macadamia nut
chocolate brownies.

795
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:19,320
And the cheese is
white chocolate ganache.

796
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,880
And I can see the lettuce,
which is made up of apple,

797
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,520
tomato that is
made out of strawberry.

798
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,680
Well done. I like the look of it.

799
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,800
Forget being shameful!

800
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,800
Oh!
LAUGHTER

801
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:39,920
My mind's asking me to like it,
because it's so fun.

802
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,840
I really like the brownie with

803
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,200
the crunch of the macadamia
that is inside.

804
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,760
The brownie in the middle I like,

805
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,320
but I think it's style
over substance for me.

806
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,760
There's too many things going on
and you're left with a...

807
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,520
..weird flavour.

808
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,920
The chips...

809
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,240
..that's OK!

810
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,560
LAUGHTER

811
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,600
It's a little shortbread with a
quite intense raspberry ketchup.

812
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,760
This is the part I could enjoy.

813
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
Next one.

814
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,040
I really enjoy the fact
that you've decided that

815
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,840
one of your desserts would
be part of the showpiece.

816
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,320
Great idea.

817
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,400
This is the first time that
we can eat a picture frame.

818
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,800
Love the idea.

819
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,720
I quite like the caramel taste.

820
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,600
However, I think it has
been compromised with the big

821
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,560
chunk of chocolate that I've eaten,
and it overtakes the sensation

822
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,680
that I'm thinking I'm eating
a shortbread.

823
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,960
The shortbread is beautiful,
the passion fruit caramel is great

824
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,040
and the combination
with the milk chocolate,

825
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,720
I could have this all day.

826
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,760
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

827
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,600
HE EXHALES

828
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,000
OWL HOOTS

829
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,440
The two other teams really strong

830
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,800
and we can't fight in the same
court, so we just, you know... Yes.

831
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,720
..did our style and... Yes!

832
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,240
..the judge tasted and
they liked some pieces,

833
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,840
they didn't like some other.

834
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,120
Yes, that was different.

835
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,120
Especially Cherish showing
her emotions the way she did.

836
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,600
When the centrepiece went up,
it did look good

837
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
and I was quite proud of it.

838
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,920
Yeah. Emotional all-round.

839
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:23,560
I think we're both anxious
and nervous about the result.

840
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,040
It's going to be very different.

841
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,280
Normally we're waiting for result
in the kitchen.

842
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:29,760
Whereas now, we are going to
be in front of friends and family.

843
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,560
Your heart's going to be going ten
times faster than it normally is.

844
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,160
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

845
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:38,920
While the finalists join
their friends and families,

846
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,480
Cherish and Benoit have a
huge decision to make.

847
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,320
Techniques and effort were good,

848
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,720
but this is the part which
let them down a little bit.

849
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,320
They tried their very best.

850
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:51,760
That is, for me, very important.

851
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,960
There is that element of showpiece.

852
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,640
The characters are there.

853
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,400
When you look at the Tower
story, or the whole concept?

854
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,640
Hello!

855
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,920
Good idea, the little, mini burger,
the concept is good.

856
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,600
Potentially, this table
could be a champion.

857
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,240
It's not going to be an easy
decision. No, it is not.

858
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,960
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

859
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:23,280
Good evening, everyone.

860
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,120
Thank you so much for coming.

861
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:29,880
The three teams in the final
have been absolutely incredible.

862
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,680
But there can only be
one winning team.

863
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,960
Please step forward.

864
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,560
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

865
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,760
After much deliberation,
the judges have decided

866
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:54,560
that the winners of Bake Off:
The Professionals 2018 are...

867
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:06,920
..Emmanuel and Sam.

868
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:09,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

869
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:15,560
Well done!

870
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,920
Well done!

871
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,120
Oh, my goodness!

872
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:27,560
That is amazing!

873
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,240
That was insane.

874
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,720
Well done!

875
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:34,960
Our journey has gone
from strength to strength.

876
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,760
We were friends,
there's no doubt about it.

877
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,000
But he was more my boss and friend
second, and I think that's changed,

878
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:42,640
and now we're friends as much
as he still is my boss.

879
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,720
Allez, show me a little tear!
Allez, come on!

880
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,240
It's Sam or nobody else.

881
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,440
There's no way I could have
done it with anybody else.

882
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,960
Well done!

883
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:51,520
Brilliant!

884
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:53,120
Well done!

885
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:56,520
I think they deserve it big time,
so I feel really happy for them.

886
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,680
We learned a lot in this competition

887
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,560
and it's just one of the
best experiences I've done.

888
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,520
I was so happy you guys made it
so far.

889
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:06,760
I've been tired, exhausted,
happy, emotional.

890
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,960
Although it has been extremely
tough, I'm going to miss it.

891
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,280
I'll miss everyone.

892
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,960
We met some great guys,
we had some amazing times,

893
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,720
it's been a real pleasure
to compete with the other guys.

894
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,880
It's friends for...

895
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,600
..very likely, life.

896
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:22,440
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

897
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,480
Do you have what it takes
to impress Benoit and Cherish?

898
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,600
