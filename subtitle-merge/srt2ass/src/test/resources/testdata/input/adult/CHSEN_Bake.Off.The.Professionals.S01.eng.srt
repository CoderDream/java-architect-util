其中还包括另一种日本食材

144
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,720
Shiso。这是一种日本的绿色草本植物。
Shiso. It's a Japanese green herb.

145
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,480
它不像罗勒，也不像薄荷……它介于两者之间。
It is not like a basil, it's not like a mint... It's in between.

146
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,000
你知道我在家里种大麻吗?
Do you know that I grow shiso at home?

147
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,720
我把它放在我的窗边，真是太棒了。
I put it by my window and it is amazing.

148
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,160
我们就着米饭吃，不是吗?
We eat it with rice, don't we?

149
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,400
是的,完全正确!

00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,080
你不抽，对吧?
You don't smoke it, no?

To fill their tartes aux fruits, Chris and BJ are going even further.

153
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,880
我们用沙棘做奶油蛋糕。
We are using sea buckthorn in our creme patissiere.

154
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
这是一种生长在海边的浆果。
It's a berry that grows by the sea.

155
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,880
它非常锋利。它几乎像果子露。
It is very sharp. It is almost like sherbet.

156
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,200
通常情况下，它是有毒的，但一旦煮熟，
Ordinarily, it is poisonous, but once it is cooked up,

157
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,760
它有一种非常棒的味道。

没有一点危险的生活是什么?

贝尔·格里尔斯是我最崇拜的人之一。

我爱他。他不会看这个的。
I love him. He's not going to watch this.

165
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,800
我也不在乎
I don't care.

166
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,880
他们的水果蛋挞以芒果为特色，

167
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,520
椰子蛋白霜和沙棘凝胶。

168
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
它们潜在的有毒成分已经有了致命的
And their potentially poisonous ingredient has already had a lethal

169
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,560
对法式奶油的影响。
effect on their creme patissiere.

170
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,320
这很快就分裂了。
That has immediately split.

171
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
我想泥已经和奶油分开了。
I think the puree has split with the cream.

172
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,800
感觉正好。我感觉出奇的平静
Okey dokey. I am feeling weirdly calm,

173
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,000
但我相信这种情况会改变的。
but I'm sure that's going to change.

174
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,400
沃伦河的男孩们并不是唯一一支开始探索的队伍
The boys from the Warren aren't the only team beginning to discover

175
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,800
第一次挑战有多难。
just how difficult this first challenge is.

176
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
一个小时。快一个小时了，Hideko。
One hour. Nearly an hour gone, Hideko.

177
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,400
现在得用力了。
Have to push now.

178
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,640
是的。茱莉亚，蛋挞已经在烤箱里了。
Yeah. Julia, the tart in the oven already.

179
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
他们正要进去。
There are about to go in.

180
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,760
烘蛋挞饼，
With tart cases baking,

181
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,280
剩下的每一分钟都需要仔细安排。
every remaining minute will need to be carefully scheduled.

182
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,720
他们需要足够的时间让箱子冷却，然后才能装进去……
They need enough time for the cases to cool before they can fill them...

183
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,040
这事得快点了。
This needs to hurry up, like.

184
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,200
. .而且它们的馅料需要尽早凝固……

00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,080
我们还没到那一步。我想我们快没时间了。
We are not there yet. I think we're going to run out of time.

188
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,880
如果我开始跑来跑去哭，那就是信号了。
If I start running around and crying, that'll be the telltale sign.

189
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,760
这里越来越暖和了，不是吗?
It's getting warmer in here, isn't it?

190
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,680
时间可能是达瑞尔和巴拉特最不担心的事情。
Time could be the least of Darryl and Bharat's worries.

191
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,200
我们有了德国甜酱。

192
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,600
它是无蛋的。这是一种很棒的糕点。
It's an eggless. It's a great pastry.

193
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,800
你们通常不喜欢在食谱中使用鸡蛋吗?
Do you guys normally go against using eggs in your recipes?

194
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,120
我对鸡蛋过敏。
I'm a actually allergic to egg.

195
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,480
啊!你对鸡蛋过敏?
Ah! You're allergic to eggs?

196
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,240
是的，我是。你负责品酒吗?
I am, yes. Do you do the tasting?

197
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,880
我负责品酒。啊，好了。
I do the tasting. Ah, there we go.

198
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,200
Darryl和他的家人住在康沃尔，
Darryl lives with his family in Cornwall,

199
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,400
但每天通勤去伯明翰

这两种达里尔都没尝过
neither of which Darryl has ever tasted.

204
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,800
错误发生了，我最后住进了医院。
Mistakes have happened and I have ended up in hospital.

205
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:01,600
医生确实说过"放弃吧，你可能会害死自己"
The doctors did say, "Give it up, you could end up killing yourself."

206
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,520
我确实走开了，想了一会儿。
I did go away and think about it for a minute..

207
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,680
. .然后决定继续

208

因为这是我喜欢做的事。

山姆和伊曼纽尔还面临着一个死敌……

我们决定走一条完全不同的路，

把它们浸在百香果可可脂里。

哔哔声!我们在后面。
BLEEP! We're behind.

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,120
如果制作24个完美无瑕的水果蛋挞还不够苛刻的话……
If creating 24 flawless tartes aux fruits wasn't demanding enough...

228
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,480
把它们冻起来……两队还要完成另一个甜点——

229
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,840

我记得，当我还小的时候，走进那些面包店

它会让我小时候喜欢的糕点更加美味。

238
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,160
克里斯。即使他们已经毁了他们的行程…

239
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
我估计沙棘还要多一点。
I reckon even slightly more sea buckthorn.

240
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,400
对，放进去。

我们用的是粗糙的酥皮基底

247
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,640
然后我们在上面撒上甜面酱。为什么?
and then we have capped that with the sweet paste. Why?

248
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,520
因为我们做酥皮的时候遇到了很多麻烦
Because we were having so much trouble with the puff pastry

249
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,320
没有按照我们想要的方式上升。

冲击。
Shock it.

251

嘿，让我们学习和生活。

我希望如此。或者活到老学到老。是啊!
I hope so. Or live and learn. Yeah!

253
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,120
学习然后离开?
Learn and leave?

254
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,520
学习后离开。
Learn and leave.

255
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:19,360
练习重现这一经典并不适合西奥和英子
Practising recreating this classic hasn't suited Theo and Hideko's

256
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
艺术的一面。

257
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,960
我试了一个快的。祝你好运——一切顺利。
I tried a fast one. Good luck - it went well.

258
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,440
第二个坍塌了!
The second collapsed!

259
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,080

煮，煮，煮，煮。
Boil, boil, boil, boil.

261
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,440
你想尝尝这个吗?
Do you want to just taste this?

262
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
而且已经在对付达里尔的鸡蛋过敏了…
And already coping with Daryll's egg allergy...

263
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,240
里面有香草吗?它还需要更多吗?
Have you got vanilla in there? Does it need more?

264
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:38,080
它需要更多的香草，是的……巴拉特现在面临着另一个障碍。
It needs more vanilla, yeah. ..Bharat now faces another obstacle.

265
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,880
你觉得和别人聊天怎么样?
How do you feel about making conversation?

266
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
你现在做得很好。这是一个伟大的…法语发音:对话。
You're doing great now. This is a great... FRENCH PRONUNCIATION: ..conversation.

267
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,720
我以前没做过。这是一件好事吗?不是为了比赛，不是。
I haven't really made before. Is that a good thing? Not for a competition, no.

268
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,800
我是说，这基本上就是贝克维尔馅饼，不是吗?
I mean, it's basically a Bakewell tart, isn't it?

269
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,560
这是一个奇特的名字…是的，我想是的。
It's a fancy name for... Yeah, I think so.

270
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,360
这就是当Benoit谈论这件事时我的感受。
That's how I felt about it when Benoit was going ON about it.

271
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,320
芒果慕斯冻好了。
The passion and mango mousse has been frozen.

272
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,960
还有一个令人担忧的雄心勃勃的水果馅饼……
As well as a worryingly ambitious tarte aux fruits...

273
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
我做了一个aga果冻。
I made an aga jelly.

274
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,000
阿迦设定得很快，所以这样的比赛很有意义。
Aga sets fast, so makes sense for a competition like this.

275
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,920
. .山姆和伊曼纽尔找到了一种方式来进行对话。”
..Sam and Emmanuel have found a way to make the conversations'

276
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,000
简单漂亮的馅料有点复杂。
beautifully simple fillings a bit more complicated.

277
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,200
在果酱里，我们加了一点菖蒲……
To the jam, we have added a little bit of calamansi...

278
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,040
哦……这是一种柑橘。
Ooh... ..which is a citrus.

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,960
我是伴随着这种酸橙长大的。这是一个很小很小的酸橙。
I grew up with this lime. It's a small, little, tiny lime.

280
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,080
味道很浓。
Very intense, its flavour.

281
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,160
希望它不会取代覆盆子，这是有风险的。
Hopefully, it won't take over the raspberry, which is a risk.

282
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,960
即使团队对他们的谈话内容都很满意……
Even if the teams are happy with both their conversation fillings...

283
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,200
这是很多法国奶酪。
It is a lot of French beurre.

284
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
我们做一半吧。是吗?是的。
Let's do half. Yeah? Yeah.

285
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,080
. .在第一个挑战中多任务处理
..multitasking in this first challenge

286
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,600
会变得更加困难。
is about to get much harder.

287
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,760
你的慕斯冻坏了。甜蜜的!
Your mousses are frozen. Sweet!

288
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,280
除了确保他们所有的水果挞元素都在轨道上…
As well as ensuring all their tarte aux fruits elements are on track...

289
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,520
越快进入爆炸，效果越好。
The quicker it gets in the blast, the better it is.

290
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,200
我要试着把它切下来，如果太软了，
I need to try and cut out of this, and if it is too soft,

291
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,600
这将是一场噩梦。
it's going to be a nightmare.

292
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,360
. .对话必须充实和建立起来……
..the conversations have to be filled and built...

293
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,800
#哦，你得搬家了…＃
# Oh, you've got to move... #

294
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:55,480
. .还有足够的时间烤好。
..with enough time remaining for them to bake correctly.

295
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,640
我们能做到的，宝贝。我们可以把这段时间追回来。
We can do this, babes. We can claw this time back now.

296
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,600
这里有一个!
Vous avez une heure!

297
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,800
一个heure !
Une heure!

298
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,880
我甚至不知道那是否…你是这么说的吗?
I don't even know if that... Is that how you say it?

299
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,600
可能不是这个意思。
Probably doesn't mean that.

300
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,720
意思可能是“你把东西落在餐具柜上了。”
Probably means, "You have left something on the sideboard."

301
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:12,760
我们有一个小时的时间把所有事情做完。
We have an hour to have everything done.

302
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,040
肯定会很紧。
Definitely going to be tight.

303
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,440
现在出了很多汗。
Perspiring a lot now.

304
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,640
好了。
Nice.

305
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,920
她用葡萄牙语数数
SHE COUNTS IN PORTUGUESE

306
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,000
对话的结局是我最担心的，
The finish on the conversations is what I'm most worried about,

307
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,320
确保它们看起来干净整洁。
to make sure they all look neat and tidy.

308
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,280
太小了。它们必须在接下来的15分钟内放进烤箱。
Too small. They have got to go in the oven in the next 15 minutes.

309
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,840
我们得把这些放进烤箱。
We need to get these in the oven.

310
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,200
我们还剩多久?
How long have we got left?

311
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,120
46分钟。
46 minutes.

312
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,080
我的眼镜上全是香槟酒。
Got frangipane all over my glasses.

313
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,920
我不喜欢谈话。
I don't like conversations.

314
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,880
你保持的越简单，你需要的就越完美。
The simpler you keep it, the more perfect you need to have it.

315
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,680
只是用皇家糖衣覆盖对话。
Just covering the conversations with royal icing.

316
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,600
煮25分钟，所以…
They take 25 minutes to cook, so...

317
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,520
他们得在六分钟内进去。
They need to be going in in the next six minutes.

318
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,760
我觉得你野心太大了。好的。
I think you're being a bit overambitious. OK.

319
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,520
然后，伊曼纽尔，把非常薄的酥皮放在上面。
And then, Emmanuel, put very thin strips of puff pastry on the top.

320
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,520
这会在糖霜烹饪时产生裂缝。
That will create the cracks in the icing when it cooks.

321
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,240
帮我一下。我们得结束这一切。
Give me a hand. We need to finish this.

322
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:11,640
43分钟。否则，它出不来。
43 minutes. Otherwise, it won't get out.

323
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,080
沸腾了，伙计，沸腾了。对不起，对不起，对不起。
It's boiling, man, it is boiling. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

324
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,640
把它放在上面，防止染色过多。
Putting it on top to stop the colouring too much.

325
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,840
否则，就会很黑。
Otherwise, it's going to be very dark.

326
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,040
伯努瓦希望在上面放些糕点，
Benoit did expect some pastry on top,

327
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,040
但我们只是在上面涂上黄油。
but we just score over them with butter.

328
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,120
一定快到了。
Must be almost there.

329
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,160
当Chris和BJ开始弥补时间的时候…
While Chris and BJ are beginning to make up time...

330
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,400
是的。
Yeah.

331
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,080
. .Hideko和Theo开始挣扎……
..Hideko and Theo are starting to struggle...

332
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
半小时……他们并不孤单。
Half an hour. ..and they are not alone.

333
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,200
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

334
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,400
慕斯比我们想要的稍微厚一点。
The mousse is slightly thicker than we wanted it.

335
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,400
现在有点汗流浃背。
Bit of a sweaty mess at the moment.

336
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,560
Hideko，现在就放，否则他们不会…是的。
Hideko, put them now or they won't be... Yeah.

337
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,880
这些要放进烤箱了。
These are going in the oven.

338
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,160
对，对，对。按钮的哔哔声
Yeah, yeah, yeah. BUTTONS BEEP

339
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,720
好吧，芭芭丝，接下来是什么?
Right then, babs, what's next?

340
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,880
水果馅饼。
The fruit tart.

341
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,080
一，二，三。
One, two, three.

342
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,280
一，二，三。
One, two, three.

343
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,560
搅拌机开始震动
MIXER WHIRS

344
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,960
釉。我们要加一点红色。来吧!
Glaze. We'll add a bit of red to it. Come on!

345
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,840
萨姆的摩丝现在需要手工定型了。
Sam's mousses will now need to be shaped by hand...

346
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,520
我们需要调整。修剪指挥棒。
We need to adjust. Trim the baton.

347
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,680
. .这需要时间。
..which will take time.

348
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,520
有点乱。
It's a little messy.

349
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:22,200
我在做酸橙鱼子酱来配水果馅饼。
I'm making the lime caviar to go on the fruit tart.

350
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,040
酸橙汁，糖，琼脂的混合物。
A mixture of lime juice, sugar, agar-agar.

351
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,400
把它放进冷油里。
Just drop it into cold oil.

352
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,120
当我还是个孩子的时候，我总是喝五活果汁。
As a child, I was always given the juice drink Five Alive.

353
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,560
这就是它让我想起的。
That's what it reminds me of.

354
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,680
可以说，你只剩下小酸橙球了。
You are left with little lime balls, so to speak.

355
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:40,960
这让我想起了格罗巴格。
And then, reminds me a little bit of Grotbags.

356
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,400
回到爆炸现场。
Back to the blast.

357
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,960
他重塑了他的摩丝……
He has reshaped his mousses...

358
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,280
哦,哔哔声!
Oh, BLEEP!

359
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,560
. .但现在山姆把它们放在托盘上，托盘太大了，放不回去
..but now Sam's put them on a tray that is too big to go back into the

360
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,680
爆炸冷却器。有什么问题，托盘吗?
blast chiller. What's the problem, the tray?

361
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,400
我变得非常非常紧张。
I'm getting very, very tense.

362
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:55,560
18分钟。持续推动。是的。
18 minutes. Last push. Yeah.

363
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
我汗流浃背。
I'm sweating my BLEEP off.

364
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,160
他们还好吗?
Are they all right?

365
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,320
那么这个蛋挞还需要做什么呢?构建!
So what else is left to do for that tart? Build!

366
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,160
我给它上了一层橙色的釉，
I am glazing it with an orange glaze,

367
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,200
这让它更有一点柑橘的味道。
which gives it a bit more citrus flavour.

368
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,720
我们还有多少时间?
How long we got?

369
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,400
大厨们，你们有15分钟。
Chefs, you have 15 minutes.

370
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,960
我们在鲍比球上。是的。
We're on the Bobby Ball. Yeah.

371
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,040
继续，汤米，过来。
Rock on, Tommy, over here.

372
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,600
他们看起来有点邋遢。
They look a little bit sort of scruffy.

373
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,320
我要做35根羽毛。
I'm going to do 35 feathers.

374
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,680
超级好。
Super nice.

375
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:20,720
我在给沙棘糕点奶油倒汁。
I'm just piping our sea buckthorn pastry cream.

376
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,240
那是六分钟。
That's six minutes.

377
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,600
我们会准时到达的。
We are going to be just on time.

378
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,840
可可脂很好切。
Cocoa butter's cutting well.

379
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,000
当你蘸着冷冻的东西时，巧克力会立即反应。
When you're dipping something that's frozen, chocolate reacts instantly.

380
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,960
我们还有多少分钟?
How many minutes do we have?

381
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,440
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

382
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,280
你喜欢朗姆酒吗?＃
# Do you like pina coladas...? #

383
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,920
哦,他妈的!他们是不是很热?
Oh, bugger! Are they hot, by any chance?

384
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,600
我想继续我的谈话。
I want to jump on to my conversations.

385
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:53,320
其中一些刚刚爆发。
Some of them have just exploded.

386
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,920
他们看起来有点粗糙。
They are looking a bit rough.

387
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,560
混合淹没了语音
MIXING DROWNS SPEECH

388
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,720
这是科米特生孩子时的样子。
This is what it looks like when Kermit has babies.

389
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,760
冗长的。
Overstuffed.

390
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,240
我不在乎，只要我们把他们救出来就行。
I don't care, as long as we get them out.

391
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,920
一些朗姆酒从移液管里漏出来了。百香果。
Some of the rum has leaked out of these pippettes. Passion fruit.

392
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,480
大厨们，你们还有一分钟就要开始迷你经典了
Chefs, you have one minute until your miniature classics

393
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,520
必须上桌。
must be served.

394
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:21,040
现在每一秒都很重要。
Every second's important now.

395
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,360
哦，别这样，别这样。我们还有时间，不是吗?
Oh, come on, come on, come on. We've got time, haven't we?

396
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,880
是的。别涂太多金色的，伙计。
Yeah. Try not to put too much gold on, mate.

397
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,200
哦，哔哔哔的东西，伙计。
Oh, BLEEP things man.

398
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,800
来吧，你这个小混蛋。
Come on, you little bugger.

399
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,040
她很重要
SHE COUNTS

400
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,520
好了，厨师们，时间到了。
OK, chefs, time's up.

401
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,000
请离你的蛋挞远点。
Please, step away from your tarts.

402
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,840
时间过得比你想象的要快得多。
The time goes a lot quicker than you think.

403
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,840
最好的是……我不需要尿尿。
Best thing is...didn't need to pee.

404
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,320
不，我也不太想尿尿。
No, I don't really need to pee either.

405
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,360
这两支球队现在将面临伯努瓦和珍爱的审判
The teams will now face the judgment of Benoit and Cherish

406
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,600
这是第一次。
for the very first time.

407
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,440
这太可怕了，不是吗?
This is terrifying, init?

408
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,280
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

409
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,200
希尔顿公园巷，请到审判桌来。
Hilton Park Lane, please come up to the table to be judged.

410
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,600
它们看起来和我记忆中的很接近。
They look pretty close to what I remember.

411
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,960
这是一个漂亮的，完整的挞。
It's a nice, full tart.

412
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,840
四季橘…他吹覆盆子
The calamondin... HE BLOWS RASPBERRY

413
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,000
我想要覆盆子酱。
I would have rather raspberry on it.

414
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:36,440
我们试试水果馅饼吧。它们看起来很性感。
Let's try the fruit tart. They look very sexy.

415
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,640
你还在上面撒了一点金粉。
You've dusted a little bit of gold dust on it as well.

416
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,960
它会提升整件事。
It just lifts up the whole thing.

417
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,320
干得好，大厨。谢谢你！
Well done, chef. Thank you.

418
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,400
调味方面，我放了很多酸，
Flavour-wise, I've got a lot of acid,

419
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,760
没有什么真正有趣的东西出来。
nothing really interesting coming out of it.

420
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,040
这里太沉了，琼脂太多了。
It's so heavy over here, it's just too much agar.

421
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,760
非常感谢。谢谢你！
Thank you very much. Thank you.

422
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
谈话，就结尾而言，
Conversation - as far as the finishing is concerned,

423
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,240
因为你没有在上面放任何糕点，我们看到了杏仁奶油。
because you didn't put any pastry on the top, we see the almond cream.

424
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,080
好的部分是杏仁奶油，很明显，烤得很好。
The good part is the almond cream, obviously, is baked nicely.

425
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:31,240
然而，执行力很差。
However, the execution is poor.

426
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,640
水果馅饼怎么样?
What about the fruit tart?

427
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,080
你的釉很漂亮，很光滑。
Your glaze is beautiful, it's smooth.

428
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,960
我们有草莓，菠萝，芒果，
We've got the strawberry, pineapple, mango,

429
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,920
但它不会去任何特别的地方。
but it doesn't go anywhere special.

430
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,360
有点平。好的。
It's a bit flat. OK.

431
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,080
它让我兴奋吗?不是真的。
Does it excite me? Not really.

432
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,800
这酥皮摸起来很厚，不容易碎。
The pastry feels thick and it's not flaky.

433
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,880
但你把水果挞提升到了另一个层次。
But you've moved the fruit tart to a different level.

434
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,400
哦!
Oops!

435
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,320
我对酸奶慕斯不感兴趣。它尝起来像酸奶。
Yoghurt mousse doesn't excite me. It tastes of yoghurt.

436
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,000
再放一点大黄，但要放得很轻。
And I get a little bit of rhubarb, but very light.

437
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,160
所以我认为这不是水果挞，我认为这是酸奶挞。
So I don't think it's a fruit tart, I think it's a yoghurt tart.

438
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,880
这次谈话，是王室的锦上添花
The conversation - the royal icing on the top

439
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,440
看起来不太吸引人，所以…他吹覆盆子
doesn't look very appealing, so... HE BLOWS RASPBERRY

440
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,680
我不吃糕点。如你所见，这是生的
I will not eat the pastry. As you can see, that's raw -

441
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,520
今晚会让我肚子疼的。
that will give me tummy ache tonight.

442
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,840
我的心碎了……
My heart was broken...

443
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,400
. .因为我们刚才在说琉璃和琉璃。
..because we were talking about the glaze with the shisho.

444
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,040
但是当我看到水果的时候，它太干了。
But when I look at the fruit, it's just so dry.

445
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,160
你完全失去了控制。是的。
You lost control completely. Yeah.

446
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,080
这就是我要找的十字形图案。
This is the little crisscross pattern I'm looking for.

447
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,440
但很明显，我们有一些自负。
But obviously we've got a few puffed up.

448
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,800
谈话不一定要夸夸其谈。
A conversation doesn't have to puff up.

449
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,080
啊!它看起来是满的——这很重要!
Ah! It looks full - and that's important!

450
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,120
上面的糖霜有点少了。
The amount of icing you've got on the top, which is a bit short.

451
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:20,840
我失去了那孩子咬你牙齿的乐趣。
I'm losing that kid's pleasure of snapping your teeth into this.

452
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,080
还有烘焙，虽然不完美，但很好吃。
And the baking, not perfect, but pleasant.

453
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,760
我非常高兴与愉快!
I'm very happy with pleasant!

454
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,720
笑声
LAUGHTER

455
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,720
看看你的水果馅饼，
Looking at your fruit tartlets,

456
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,200
我需要墨镜才能看到你的鱼子酱。
I need sunglasses to look at your caviar.

457
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,760
我不能忍受这么多颜色的样子。
I can't bear the look of so much colour.

458
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,640
他猛地呼了一口气
HE EXHALES SHARPLY

459
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,920
我该怎么处理这个瓶子?
What do I do with the bottle?

460
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,280
过了头。这是椰子朗姆酒焦糖。
Over the top. It's a coconut rum caramel.

461
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,640
我不确定这是好是坏。
I'm not sure if that's good or bad.

462
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,920
我喜欢它。
I like it.

463
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,840
我说了，我说了，我喜欢!
I said it, I said it - I like it!

464
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,400
我喜欢菠萝，所以你是我的最爱。
I love pineapples, so you got my sweet spot there.

465
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,080
好的。
OK.

466
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,680
我不喜欢……
I don't like it...

467
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,120
. .我喜欢!
..I love it!

468
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:03,520
太好吃了，我的天啊。
It's so tasty, oh, my goodness.

469
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,760
现在你的膝盖变软了。我得到…!
Now your knees are going soft. I'm getting...!

470
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,960
好吧，我告诉你，鱼子酱真的非常非常酸，
Well, I tell you what, the caviar is really, really acidic,

471
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,480
它和各种元素都融合得很好。
and it blends very well with every element.

472
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,440
还有你洒在上面的，太棒了。
And this that you drizzle on - sensational.

473
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,800
谢谢，非常感谢。
Thank you, thank you very much.

474
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,800
这很好。哦,是的。
That's nice. Oh, yeah.

475
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,000
我没想到会这样。这是一半一半。
I wasn't expecting that. It was half and half.

476
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,320
我真没想到会这样。
I really wasn't expecting that.

477
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,760
沃伦，请过来。
The Warren, please come forward.

478
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,040
这就像一场婚礼，不是吗?
It's like a wedding, isn't it?

479
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,520
我们有24个吗?你没有。你有18个。
Have we got 24? You do not. you've got 18.

480
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:48,200
哦，他们只做了18件!
Oh, they only did 18!

481
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,280
我不认为你特别着急，
I don't believe you were particularly rushing,

482
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,800
或者你表现得不像。是的。
or you didn't behave like you were. Yeah.

483
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,640
你只是站在那里无所事事。
You were standing around doing nothing.

484
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,360
首先，肠衣是生的。我不能吃那个。
Firstly, the casing is uncooked. I can't eat that.

485
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,280
奶油很无趣，很无趣，我不喜欢。
And the cream is dull, it's boring, it's not to my liking.

486
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,280
对不起，我不能吃。
Sorry, can't eat it.

487
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,480
大多数人都说过，
Well, most of it has been said,

488
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:16,520
不过沙棘的味道是我喜欢的。
except the sea buckthorn flavour is one I like.

489
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:19,880
就谈话而言，它已经爆发了。
As far as the conversation is concerned, it has exploded.

490
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,920
是的。但是,是的…是烤好的吗?是的。
Yeah. But, yeah...is it baked? Yep.

491
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,040
不!它不是。
Nope! It isn't.

492
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,360
杏仁奶油在哪里?它烤得不对。
Where is the almond cream? It hasn't baked correctly.

493
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,200
我有点失望。
I'm a bit disappointed.

494
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:40,840
如果我是一个专业厨师，你把这个带到比赛中，
If I'm a professional chef, you bring this up into the competition,

495
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,080
我会很尴尬的。
I'll be so embarrassed.

496
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,840
哇……
Wow...

497
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,120
什么也说不出来。我们被毁了。
Can't really say anything. We just got destroyed.

498
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,240
也许我们有点太放松了。
Maybe we have been a bit too relaxed.

499
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,840
有点破坏灵魂，但不会破坏气氛。
Slightly soul-destroying, but not going to let it kill the vibe.

500
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:01,440
明天的第二项挑战规模巨大，以至于各队
Tomorrow's second challenge is on such a grand scale that the teams

501
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:04,840
有黄金时间准备需要的元素吗
have been given a golden hour to prepare any elements that need

502
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,360
一夜之间设置。
setting overnight.

503
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,440
到目前为止，谁印象深刻?我来自威尔士的同事们
Who's impressed so far? My little colleagues from Wales

504
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,240
在圣大卫酒店。
from St David's Hotel.

505
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,800
他们准备，排练，
They prepared, they rehearsed,

506
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
所以他们没有低估竞争。
so they didn't underestimate the competition.

507
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,240
谁有麻烦了?
Who is in trouble?

508
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,200
甜馅饼俱乐部。它的野心太大了。
The SweetArt Club. It's just too ambitious.

509
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,640
名胜世界…?
Resorts World...?

510
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,440
我觉得他这么做很保险。
I think he's playing it very safe.

511
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,520
没有什么令人兴奋的。
There's nothing that is exciting.

512
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,560
但你还有，沃伦团队。
But you've got, also, The Warren team.

513
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,520
如果你是来参加比赛的，你必须做好心理准备。
If you come for a competition, you have to be mentally prepared.

514
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,120
少一点谈话，多一点行动。
A little less conversation, a little bit more action.

515
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
在我们的六支队伍参加之前还有一个挑战
There's one challenge remaining before one of our six teams will

516
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:51,600
不得不退出竞争。
have to leave the competition.

517
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,920
欢迎回来，大厨们。我们都希望你们都休息好了

518
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,640
为今天的表演挑战赛做准备
and prepared for today's Showpiece Challenge.

519
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,960
现在，这是关于一个普通的甜点
Now, this is all about taking an ordinary dessert

520
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,640
并把它变成一些非凡的东西。
and transforming it into something extraordinary.

521
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,880
今天，评委们希望你们喜欢自己
And today, the judges would like you to like you

522
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,160
来改造黑森林蛋糕
to transform Black Forest gateau.

523
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,080
评委们，你们在找什么?
So, judges, what are you looking for?

524
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,480
传统上，这道甜点的特色是巧克力，
Well, traditionally, the dessert features chocolate,

525
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,920
奶油和樱桃白兰地，叫樱桃酒。
cream and a cherry brandy called kirsch.

526
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,480
我想要那些味道。我也想在你的展品中感受大自然。
I want those flavours. I want also to feel nature in your showpieces.

527
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,880
基本上，伯努瓦希望你在蛋糕里放足够的樱桃酒
Basically, Benoit wants you to put enough kirsch in the gateau that

528
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:33,520
他产生幻觉，以为自己真的在森林里。
he hallucinates that he's actually in a forest.

529
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,040
做大点，不然你就得回家。
Go big, or you will go home.

530
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,400
大厨们，你们还有四个小时

531
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,760

果冻，海绵，香蒂伊。
Jelly, sponge, Chantilly.

535
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,360
当我还是个孩子的时候，我们经常

536
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,880
黑森林是我们的生日礼物。

537
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,400
是莎拉·李冻住了。
It was Sara Lee frozen.

538
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,040
它得解冻两天左右
It had to defrost for about two days

539
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,920
在你真正熬过去之前。
before you could actually get through it.

540
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,040
很复古。
Very retro.

541
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,480
向这个日耳曼经典致敬需要
Paying tribute to this Germanic classic will require

542
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,240
足够24人享用的令人垂涎的甜点

还有一个令人瞠目结舌的可食用雕塑。

大量的创新和表演技巧。
Plenty of innovation and a sense of showmanship.

547
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,680
质地和味道很重要。
It's very important to get texture and flavour right.

548
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,040
每个组成部分之间都必须保持良好的平衡。
Every component has to balance very well with each other.

549
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,640
如果味道达不到我的标准，我是不会接受的。
If the taste is not up to my standard, it will not be acceptable.

550
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,440
我去过黑森林的时候，
When I've been to the Black Forest,

551
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,880
它是美丽的。
it was beautiful.

552
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,120
这就是我们的灵感来源。
That is the inspiration we got it from.

553
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,600
朱莉会专注于那棵树，
Julie is going to be concentrating on the tree,

554
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,160
我来做开胃菜

由蛋白霜慕斯，樱桃果盘，松糕，

and a chocolate sable biscuit base, Marta's entremets sharing dessert

557
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,800
会坐在朱莉精致的糖树下

558
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:55,200
模具是有弹性的PVC，周围有很多透明胶带。

559
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,640
蓝彼得，吃你的心吧!
Blue Peter, eat your heart out!

560
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,800
我们把地产附在了餐厅上，
We've got the estate attached to the restaurant,

561
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,880
我自己也喜欢在森林里度过时光。
and I also love spending time in the forest myself.

562
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,880
对于热爱大自然的Chris和BJ来说，
For nature lovers Chris and BJ,

563
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,240
这一挑战似乎提供了一个完美的救赎机会。
this challenge would appear to offer the perfect chance for redemption.

564
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:11,400
比贾尼，你在搞什么鬼?呃,我…擦一根棍子?
Bjarni, what the hell are you doing? Er, I'm... Polishing a stick?

565
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,960
我的斧柄已经做了一半了。
I'm partway through an axe handle.

566
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,400
我们要让藤蔓沿着斧头向下延伸
We're going to have vines coming sort of down and around the axe,

567
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,360
几乎就像它在回收……杂草丛生。杂草丛生。
almost like it's reclaiming... Overgrown. Overgrown.

568
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,640
我有点糊涂了。那么你的展示品是什么?只是斧头吗?
I'm a bit confused. So what is your showpiece? It's just the axe?

569
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,960
那将是藤蔓缠绕的斧头
It'll be the axe with the vines coming around

570
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,440
往下走到大理石上。
and going down onto the marble.

571
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,360
BJ的巧克力斧头会被
BJ's chocolate axe will be surrounded by

572
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,200
单独的樱桃形甜点
individual cherry-shaped desserts in

573
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,400
这是他们拯救自己的最后一搏。
their final bid to save themselves from the chop.

574
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,720
这就够特别了吗?
Is that going to be extraordinary enough?

575
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,880
如果结果和我们想象的一样，
If it comes out the way that our vision of it is,

576
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,080
我觉得它会让人印象深刻。
I think it's going to look pretty impressive.

577
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,480
你通常不会用斧头砍樱桃，对吧?
You don't normally harvests cherries with an axe, do you?

578
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,160
不。我不知道，我从来没做过。
No. I don't know - I've never done it.

579
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,720
我们都是关于森林砍伐的!
We're all about deforestation!

580
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,040
自从我们在一起…＃
# Since we've been together... #

581
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,800
迈克尔和丽贝卡正在森林深处冒险。
Michael and Rebekah are venturing even deeper into the forest.

582
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,560
我们走到森林的地面上，
We sort of went like the forest floor,

583
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,160
有点怪异，但也很漂亮。
sort of eerie but also pretty.

584
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,120
我要把它刮下来，像树根一样。
I am going to shave it all down so it's like a tree root.

585
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,760
我们有巧克力土，巧克力蘑菇。
We have chocolate soil, chocolate mushrooms.

586
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,480
我们做过一次样板。有一次，在凌晨一点。
We've made the showpiece once. Once, at one o'clock in the morning.

587
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,680
吃披萨的时候。非常迷人。
While eating pizza. It was very glamorous.

588
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,240
在迈克尔扭曲的巧克力树枝下，
Beneath Michael's twisted chocolate branch,

589
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,440
他们的森林地面将点缀着樱桃形状的甜点
their forest floor will be dotted with cherry-shaped desserts

590
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,280
特色一套插入樱桃巴伐利亚酒和酸樱桃凝胶。
featuring a set insert of kirsch bavarois and a sour cherry gel.

591
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,400
确保结构稳定，能承受
Making sure the structure's stable and will hold -

592
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,920
这是最重要的部分。
that's kind of the biggest part.

593
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,680
没人希望它倒下!
Nobody wants it to fall over!

594
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,760
事实证明，野心过大导致了伊曼纽尔和萨姆的失败
Over-ambition proved to be Emmanuel and Sam's downfall

595
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,040
在第一个挑战中——一个他们似乎没有学到的教训。
in the first challenge - a lesson they don't seem to have learned.

596
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:33,800
因为有这么多的组成部分，我们真的必须全力以赴。
Because of so many components, we really have to go for it.

597
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,320
我们在做一个布谷鸟钟。
We're making a cuckoo clock.

598
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,800
这些会变成一个分支。
These turn into a branch.

599
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,240
那边那些小东西，会变成鸟的。
Those little things over there, they will turn into birds.

600
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,960
他们的布谷鸟钟将安放在巧克力树的树枝上。
Their cuckoo clock will nestle in the branches of a chocolate tree.

601
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,800
在它的下面会放上香蒂伊酱，
Beneath it will sit individual desserts filled with Chantilly,

602
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,040
樱桃果冻和巧克力软糖海绵蛋糕。
cherry jelly and a chocolate fudge sponge.

603
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,320
让事情更复杂的是，
And just to make things even more complicated,

604
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,320
他们的目标是让巧克力布谷鸟唱歌。
they are aiming to make their chocolate cuckoo sing.

605
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,800
这是一个小的机制
This is a little mechanism which is

606
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,480
要重现鸟叫的声音。
going to reproduce the sound of a bird.

607
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,880
如果不成功，就由萨姆来唱歌，
If it doesn't work, Sam will be doing the singing,

608
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,560
因为他的歌声比我的好。
because his singing is better than mine.

609
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,440
希望避免在比赛中过早出局
Hoping to avoid an early exit from the competition...

610
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,960
把这部分刮干净，让边缘光滑。
Just shaving that piece just to get a nice, smooth edge.

611
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,720
. .Darryl和Bharat正在避免任何传统的联系
..Darryl and Bharat are avoiding any conventional connection

612
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,560
和黑森林一起。
with the Black Forest.

613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:17,120
我们会得到一个倾斜的长方形。
We're going to have a oblong shape, tilted.

614
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:19,120
在它上面，我们有一个圆
On the top of that, we'll have a circle

615
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,760
这也是一个角度。
which will also be at an angle.

616
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,800
非常抽象的作品，有点不同。
Very abstract piece, a bit different.

617
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,960
他们大胆的几何塔将提供
Their bold geometric tower will provide

618
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,800
背景是三个分享主菜甜点
the backdrop for three sharing entremets desserts

619
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,480
特色是达里尔的无蛋巧克力慕斯。
featuring Darryl's eggless chocolate mousse.

620
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,080
最重要的是一定要搅拌
The most important thing is to make sure you whisk it

621
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,760
否则你会做出颗粒状的慕斯。
otherwise you end up with a really grainy mousse.

622
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,040
希望它能让他们惊叹。
It should hopefully wow them.

623
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,040
昨天，我们以为我们会让他们大吃一惊……
Yesterday, we though we was going to wow them...

624
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,240
. .显然没有!
..and obviously didn't!

625
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,720
如果Darryl的抽象设计感觉像是
If Darryl's abstract design feels like the result of

626
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,080
一晚上喝樱桃酒……
a night on the kirsch...

627
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:47,200
老实说，这是相当高的风险!
It's quite a high risk, to be honest!

628
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,120
. .Hideko的声音听起来像是她失去理智了。
..Hideko's sounds like she may have lost her marbles.

629
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,760
这是孩子们非常喜欢的玩具。
It's a very popular toy for kids.

630
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:57,040
好的。在哪里，黑森林吗?
OK. Where, in the Black Forest?

631
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,280
在这个世界上。在这个世界上。
In the world. In the world.

632
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,640
两组可食用的大理石将从糖的工作滑梯上滑下来
Careering down a sugar work slide will be two sets of edible marbles

633
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,960
两者结合起来，
which, when combined,

634
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,080
将经典的黑森林风味融合在一起
should bring the classic Black Forest flavours together.

635
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,680
先咬一口，再咬一口。
One bite and then the other bite.

636
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:16,560
我们不应该同时吸收两个弹珠。
We are not supposed to absorb both marbles at the same time.

637
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,720
啊，如果你有一个大嘴巴，这是可能的。
Ah, if you have a big mouth, it's possible.

638
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,600
你会像仓鼠一样…!
You'll be like hamster...!

639
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,160
不是我说的，是你说的。
I didn't say that, you did.

640
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,040
还剩三小时找个地方
Three hours left to secure a place

641
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
在下一轮比赛中。
in the next round of the competition.

642
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,680
请小心。
Watch your backs, please.

643
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,480
我要开始做慕斯，然后把它冻起来。
I'm going to start building the entremets and then get it frozen.

644
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,320
选择大的共享甜点……
Opting for large sharing desserts...

645
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,680
试着把它放平。
Try and lay it on flat.

646
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,840
. .可以节省Darryl和Marta宝贵的时间。
..should save Darryl and Marta precious minutes.

647
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,400
大量的酒精会抑制你的味蕾。
Loads of alcohol, muffle those taste buds.

648
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:42,760
我希望他们不是在开车回家。
I hope they're not driving home.

649
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,840
但对于其他团队来说，有几十个精致的，
But for the other teams, there are dozens of delicate,

650
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,960
单独的甜点被组装和设置。
individual desserts to be assembled and set.

651
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,840
这是慕斯，这是巧克力樱桃饼干。
This is our mousse, and this is our chocolate and cherry biscuit.

652
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:54,840
我们要把它粘在一起，然后塑形。
And we're just going to stick it together and then mould it.

653
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,600
它就像一个大理石形状。
It's going to be like a marble shape.

654
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:59,520
我们今天会准时到的。今天，我们会准时到达。
We'll be on time today. Today, we'll be on time.

655
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,680
我认为我们今天取得了很好的进展。
I think we're making good progress today.

656
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:04,520
你有冷冻樱桃酱和香蒂伊奶油
You've got a frozen cherry coulis and Chantilly cream

657
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,760
我们要把它放进巧克力慕斯里。
that we are pushing into the chocolate mousse.

658
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:11,520
但是当西奥和克里斯的甜点准备好了…
But while Theo's and Chris' desserts are ready to begin setting...

659
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,320
嗯…
Hmm...

660
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,160
. .迈克尔和丽贝卡的都还没准备好。
..Michael and Rebekah's aren't even ready to be constructed.

661
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,080
他们的樱桃巴伐利亚樱桃酒的插片没能定型。
Their kirsch bavarois inserts have failed to set.

662
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,840
你想让我怎么做?我毁了他们。
What do you want me to do? I'm ruining them.

663
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,080
尽管在迷你挑战赛中表现出色…
Despite doing well in the miniature's challenge...

664
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,080
里面是樱桃慕斯。
So this was a kirsch mousse inside.

665
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,600
当我们想把它们吹胀时，有些已经碎了。
When we were trying to puff them, some were breaking.

666
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,800
. .米迦勒和丽贝卡的甜点秀是不会成功的。
..Michael and Rebekah's showpiece desserts aren't going to plan.

667
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,520
我能看出来丽贝卡很紧张
I can see that Rebekah is nervous.

668
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,000
像风一样奔跑。
Run like the wind.

669
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,160
他们正在做一个所谓的树干。
They are making a so-called tree trunk.

670
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,600
这可能有点极简主义。
It could be a bit minimalist.

671
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,040
向诸神祈祷吧。向众神祈祷，祈求好运。
Pray to the gods. Pray to the gods and hope for the best.

672
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,040
我们正在寻找一个宏伟的样板。
We are looking for a magnificent showpiece.

673
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,040
对此，我不太确定。
With this, I'm not too sure.

674
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,600
这种简单性也有可能发挥作用。
There is potential for that simplicity to work also.

675
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,520
你觉得Darryl和Bharat怎么样?
What do you think about Darryl and Bharat?

676
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,720
我主要担心的是无蛋慕斯。
My concern is mainly the eggless mousse.

677
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:22,760
它可能会很粘稠。
It could be very gummy and sticky.

678
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,960
我期待的是Hideko和Theo的组合。
The team I am looking forward to is team Hideko and Theo.

679
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,160
他们冒了很大的风险，
They are taking quite a bit of risk here,

680
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,320
但如果它成功了，那可能是令人惊叹的因素。
but if it works that may be the wow factor.

681
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:34,920
如果成功了，我就去接甜点。
If it works I will be catching the dessert.

682
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,600
我会帮你把它卷下来。
And I will be rolling it down for you.

683
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
你能在我检查插入时帮我换一下工作吗?
Are you free to swap jobs me a second while I check the inserts?

684
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,920
这就是它出错的地方。
This is the bit where it goes wrong.

685
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,920
大厨们，你们只剩下一个小时了。
Chefs, you have just one hour left.

686
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,120
今天时间过得真快。
Time is flying today.

687
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,960
我需要把所有的东西都喷上，然后建造。
I need to spray everything and then build.

688
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,720
我们把它们冻住了，我们正在处理。
We froze them, we are on it.

689
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,760
希望都煮熟了。
Hopefully it will all be cooked.

690
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,120
我把小弹珠浸在白巧克力和可可脂里。
I'm dipping the little marbles in white chocolate and cocoa butter.

691
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,200
把它举起来，拧成大理石的样子。
Lift it up and twist it for the marble effect.

692
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,720
之后我们可以玩弹珠吗?
So we can play marbles after?

693
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,320
是的，我会打败你的。不，你不会的。我要出发了。
Yeah, I'll beat you. No, you won't. I'm going to roll out.

694
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,760
我得赶紧去把这些东西冷却一下。
I've just got to go quickly blast-chill these.

695
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,960
这是直的吗?
Is that straight?

696
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,280
直吗?
Straight?

697
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,440
每添加一个元素…它是直的吗?
Every element added... Is it straight?

698
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,960
是的。
Yes.

699
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,880
. .给本已脆弱的关节增加了额外的压力。
..puts additional strain on already fragile joints.

700
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,200
现在这里真的很热
At the moment it is really hot in here

701
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,800
所以我不能百分之百地相信这种情况会持续下去。
so I am not 100% confident that is going to hold.

702
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,000
冻结。
Freeze.

703
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,880
我们需要把斧头装上。
We need to attach the axe.

704
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:00,920
小心,小心。
Carefully, carefully.

705
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,840
我们只在边缘涂巧克力吗?
Do we just chocolate the edges?

706
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,640
我想是的。
I think so.

707
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,280
填满底部。
And just fill the bottom.

708
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,880
天气太热了。
It's too hot.

709
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,760
这里太热了。
It's so BLEEP hot in here.

710
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,360
只剩下45分钟了……在压力下。
Just 45 minutes left... Under pressure.

711
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,600
. .现在，当他们试图完成他们的建筑时……
..and now while they try to complete their constructions...

712
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,760
我要开始上釉了。
I'm going to start glazing.

713
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,920
. .制作团队没有多少时间来脱模和装饰甜点了。
..the teams are running out of time to de-mould and decorate the desserts.

714
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,360
这些是我们的樱桃。
These are our cherries.

715
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:36,520
我们要把它们浸入深色的釉中。好的。
We're going to dip them in that dark glaze. OK.

716
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,560
蜘蛛釉是釉上釉，
The spider glaze is a glaze on a glaze,

717
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,240
创造一种网络效应。
to create a sort of web effect.

718
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,200
这工作。
That worked.

719
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,880
这里确实很暖和。
It is definitely warm in here.

720
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,280
还没定下来，对吧?
It's not even set yet, is it?

721
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,840
来吧，小家伙。集合,集合。
Come on, little one. Set, set.

722
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,480
哔哔声。你没意见吧?
BLEEP. Are you all right with that?

723
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,040
你需要帮忙吗?我需要一个帮手。
Do you need a hand? I will need a hand.

724
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,840
还有半小时，大厨们。最好快点。
Half an hour left, chefs. Better get a hurry on.

725
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,600
正确的。开始吧。
Right. Here we go.

726
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,120
时间飞逝，所以你必须非常专注。
Time is just flying so you have to be really focused.

727
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,440
你会没事的。我们开始吃甜点吧。
You will be OK. Let's get on with the dessert.

728
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,400
下面有点乱，他会给我们做记号的。
A bit untidy down there, he's going to mark us off on that.

729
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,080
这只是巧克力釉。我要加一些有光泽的粉末
This is just chocolate glaze. I'm going to add some shiny powders

730
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:16,440
在上面。你能帮我看看有没有遗漏什么吗?
on top. Can you have a look to see if I've missed anything?

731
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,280
这里是1和2。
One and two there.

732
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
这个很重。
This one is quite heavy.

733
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,680
哦,不。它不是直立的。
Oh, no. It's not stood up.

734
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,880
一旦我上了闪亮的釉，它们就会完全变了。
Once I put the shiny glaze on, it will change them completely.

735
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,200
我需要把它推进去。是的。
I need to push it in. Yes.

736
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,960
小心,小心。
Carefully, carefully.

737
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,240
对，我们得把它捡起来。
Right, we need to pick it up.

738
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
保持这种状态。你明白了吗?是的。
Keep it that way. Have you got it? Yes.

739
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,240
等一下，我的手指被卡住了。
Hold on, I've got my finger stuck.

740
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
就像手套一样。
Like a glove.

741
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,040
我要把它移到桌子上。
I'm going to move it onto the table.

742
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,640
滑下去一定很有趣。
It's going to be fun to slide.

743
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
它让它变成了一米。
It made it all of one metre.

744
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:28,560
正如席琳·迪翁曾经说过的，“这是认真的。”
As Celine Dion once said, "This is getting serious."

745
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,400
这里真的很热。
It's really hot in here.

746
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,560
你掉下去了。哔哔声。
You've fallen off. BLEEP.

747
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,240
这里太热了。
It's far too hot for this.

748
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,320
我现在就去试试。
I'm just going to go for it now.

749
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,840
更多信息在这里。
More up here.

750
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,080
漂亮的一个。
Nice one.

751
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,240
等等，等等，等等，等等。
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

752
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,400
好的,冻结。
OK, freeze.

753
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,600
好的。
OK.

754
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,160
我的眼镜掉下来了。
My glasses are falling off.

755
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,440
你还有五分钟。
You have five minutes left.

756
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,160
我们得在上面放点东西。
We need to start putting things on it.

757
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,880
你觉得你还能做更多的樱桃吗?
Do you reckon you could do more cherries?

758
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,720
我觉得这样更好看。
I think it actually looks better like this.

759
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,200
我的手太热了，巧克力都要化了。
My hands are too hot, the chocolate is just melting.

760
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,720
我觉得它们太重了。
I think they are too heavy.

761
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
现在把这些放在这里。
Put these on here now.

762
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,920
确保它们面朝同一方向。
Make sure they are facing the same way.

763
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,080
说下去，对，说下去。
Go on, yes, on.

764
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,760
迈克尔。
Michael.

765
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,960
天气非常热。
It's extremely hot.

766
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,880
大厨们，你们的时间到了。
Chefs, that is your time up.

767
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,880
请离开你的展品。
Please step away from your showpieces.

768
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:50,160
短短五个小时就完成了六个令人惊叹的黑森林展示。
Six breathtaking Black Forest showpieces made in just five hours.

769
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:52,480
哇。我喜欢上面的樱桃。
Wow. I love the cherry on the top.

770
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,960
这蛋糕太棒了。
That is an amazing cake.

771
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:56,400
这太疯狂了。
That is insane.

772
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,840
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

773
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,440
鸟推
BIRD TWEETS

774
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,840
他们惊奇地笑了起来
THEY LAUGH WITH AMAZEMENT

775
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,200
伯努瓦:他还活着吗?这太疯狂了!
BENOIT: Is he alive? That is mad!

776
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,560
伯努瓦:肯定有一些漂亮的小雕刻，漂亮的小触摸。
BENOIT: Definitely some nice little carving, nice little touches.

777
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,200
我唯一的一点遗憾是它不够明亮。
My only little regret is this is lacking brightness.

778
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,400
珍惜:你所有的甜点都装在一个可食用的盘子里。
CHERISH: All your dessert is plated in an edible plate.

779
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,600
爱死它了。而且看起来也很开胃。
Love it. And also it looks really appetising.

780
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,480
你考虑过我吃东西的方式，所以当我切入的时候，
You thought about how I eat so, when I cut through,

781
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,960
我有一个樱桃和一个果冻。
I have a cherry and I have the jelly.

782
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,800
巧克力慕斯在我的味蕾上融化。
The chocolate mousse just melts on my palate.

783
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,480
我希望你能有更多的香蒂伊。
I wish you could have just a little bit more Chantilly.

784
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,480
我缺少樱桃酒的元素。
I'm lacking the kirsch element.

785
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,400
缺乏，而不是喜欢。
Lacking, not liking.

786
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,480
不过，这个海绵有一种未煮熟的面粉味，
The thing with this sponge, though, there is an undercooked flour taste,

787
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,160
因为它很笨重，所以感觉有点干。
which, because it's clunky, it feels a bit dry.

788
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,240
比起味道，我更喜欢它的视觉效果。
I prefer the visual than the way it tastes like.

789
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,160
你知道这让我想起了什么吗?
Do you know what it reminds me of?

790
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,320
鱼钩。到处都是虫子，看!
A fishing hook. There's worms everywhere, look!

791
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,000
未完成的业务。两种:是的。
Unfinished business. BOTH: Yeah.

792
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,920
你的樱桃慕斯，我尝不出樱桃味。
Your cherry mousse, I can't really taste cherry.

793
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:31,200
我还觉得海绵浸透了。
And I also think that the sponge is over soaked.

794
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,280
只是有点湿。你有慕斯和非常柔软的巴瓦鲁丝。
It's just soggy. You've got mousse and a very soft bavaroise.

795
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,280
它缺少一点质感。
It's lacking a little bit of texture.

796
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,680
我真的很喜欢你使用的3D模具。
I really like the fact that you've used the 3D mould.

797
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,960
光线以不同的方式穿透
The light penetrates in different ways

798
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,560
这样就得到了不同的阴影。
and that gives you those different shades.

799
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,680
哦，你喜欢摇摆摇摆。
Oh, you like the wobbly wobbly.

800
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,360
是的。说明你的明胶是有控制的。
Yeah. That tells me your gelatine is controlled.

801
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,880
如果我移动，没有抖动，
If I move and there's no wobble,

802
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,480
那就说明你的蛋糕很硬。
that would tell me that your cake is solid hard.

803
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,160
感谢上帝赐予我黑貂，因为黑貂带来了一点
Thank God for the sable because the sable brings a little bit

804
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,480
还有一些更有趣的东西。
of crunch and something a little bit more interesting to play with.

805
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:26,400
这很简单，但有时少即是多。
It's very simplistic but sometimes less is more.

806
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,400
你肯定利用了这一点。
You've definitely used that to your advantage.

807
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
我真的很喜欢你的樱桃。
I really like your cherry.

808
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,480
它看起来很真实。它看起来好像很甜。
It looks so real. It looks as though it is so sweet.

809
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,040
我真想大吃一顿。
I really want to tuck in.

810
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:45,360
我很喜欢巧克力慕斯。
I quite like the chocolate mousse.

811
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:48,080
我觉得樱桃对我来说太酸了。
I think the cherry is so acidic for me.

812
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,800
樱桃元素占据了一切。
The cherry element takes over everything.

813
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,520
我们没有黑森林的味道。
We don't have the flavour profile of the Black Forest.

814
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,480
看起来不错，但当你吃的时候，
Looks good, but when you get to eat it,

815
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,880
你的甜点不均衡。
there is no balance in your dessert.

816
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,360
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

817
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,560
我很期待你们的互动。
I'm looking forward to the interaction.

818
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,040
我要把它放在这里
I'm going to place it in there

819
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,040
它应该一直向下，然后得到
and it should go all the way down and get

820
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,040
放进盘子里。是的,我希望。
into the plate. Yes, hopefully.

821
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,960
笑声
LAUGHTER

822
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,120
各就各位，准备，开始!
On your marks, get set, go!

823
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,960
哇!
Wow!

824
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,200
让我们看看吃和玩是否一样有趣。
Let's see if it is as fun to eat as it is to play.

825
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:53,440
我喜欢它。很明显，问题是，
I like it. The thing is, obviously,

826
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,320
你必须一次吃一点
you have to have little bits at a time

827
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,440
但我可以把两块碎片拼在一起
but I can put two little pieces together.

828
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,520
樱桃酒的元素将黑森林凝聚在一起，所以它成功了。
The kirsch element brings the Black Forest together so it works.

829
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:02,000
我认为这真的很有趣。
I think it's really fun.

830
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:04,320
我还会再来一次吗?
Would I come back for another?

831
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:07,200
也许是为了好玩，但不是为了味道。
Perhaps for the fun but not for the taste.

832
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,560
酒太多了，我不喜欢。
The alcohol is just too much for my liking.

833
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,360
两半场比赛。
A game of two halves.

834
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,040
干得好，谢谢。谢谢你！
Well done, thank you. Thank you.

835
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,280
它是可以修复的，对吗?
It can be repaired, right?

836
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:47,080
它是圆的，它是方的，它是圆的……
It's round, it's Square, it's round...

837
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,360
. .它仍然是方的。
..and it's still square.

838
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,600
一切都是实实在在的，这对我来说很苛刻。
Everything is really solid, it's very harsh for me.

839
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:56,320
如果这是对几何形状的挑战，
If it would have been a challenge on geometrical shapes,

840
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
是的，我明白了。
yes, I got that.

841
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,480
好的。我有很浓的酒味。
OK. I've got a strong alcohol flavour.

842
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,880
海绵浸透了，所以质地很软，糊状。
The sponge has over soaked, so a very soft, mushy texture.

843
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:19,720
我想再咬一口。
I would love a little bit more bite.

844

846
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,120

..not strong enough.

847
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,480
我还希望你只用纯食材呢。
I was wishing that you just used pure ingredients.

848

简单的事情有时也可以如此美好。

849
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,280
你做什么都加太多明胶了。
You add in too much gelatine in everything.

850

当我这样做的时候，这对我不好。

现在，有很多工作要做吗?也许不是。

00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:36,120
其他球队的情况正好相反，所以……
Other teams have had the reverse of that, so...

865
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,200
这很难说。
It's difficult to say.

866
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,280
Benoit和珍惜已经做出了决定。

在某种程度上，我很高兴是我们，但同时也很糟糕。
In a way, I am pleased it's us but it also sucks at the same time.

像最弱小的羚羊一样被干掉

要有创意，但不要忘记
Be creative, but don't forget -

在分层切片中，每个元素都是可见的。
In a layered slice, every single element is visible.

84
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,560
因此，要想取得成功，两支球队必须结合各自的天赋
So to succeed, the teams must combine flair

85
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,440
将风味和质地完美结合
in marrying flavours and textures with precision

86
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,000
将它们的组件分层。
in layering their components.

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
伯努瓦选择用经典的，
And Benoit has chosen to try the teams with a classic,

88
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,600
以法语单词“滚”命名，也就是roulade。
named after the French word "to roll" - the roulade.

89
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,680
法国人的经典卷饼
The classical roulade for a French person

90
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,880
是传统的圣诞原木。
is the traditional Christmas log.

91
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,680
当我还是学徒的时候，我们一起度过了最后一周
When I was an apprentice, we were spending the last week

92
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,560
在圣诞节前每天都这样做。
before Christmas doing these every single day.

93
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,440
哦，我非常喜欢。
Oh, I like it very much.

94
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,640
你可以使用很多海绵，
There are many sponges you can use,

95
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,920
任何能给你一点弹性的海绵。
any sponge which will give you a little bit of elasticity.

96
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:22,360
但是滚球的技术性在于能否滚球
But the technicality of the roulade is being able to roll it

97
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
漂亮的圆形。你不会想要卷成方形的。
nice and circular. You don't want the roulade to go squarish.

98
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,880
这在国内可能会被接受，但这是一场比赛。
It may be accepted at home, but this is a competition.

99
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,200
你将无处可藏。
There will be nowhere to hide.

100
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,600
山姆和伊曼纽尔，你们好吗?
Sam and Emmanuel, how are you doing?

101
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,200
早上好,先生们。早上好。
Morning, gentlemen. Good morning.

102
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,360
上周的获奖者们，你们感到压力了吗?
Last week's winners, are you feeling the pressure?

103
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,800
是的，我们有。你能跟我们谈谈你的行程吗?
Yes, we do. Would you be able to talk to us about your roulade?

104
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,040
我们保留了基本的成分。
We kept the basic ingredients.

105
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,720
我们把它保留了下来，差不多就是这样了。
We kept it round, and that's more or less everything.

106
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,120
所以你在某种程度上解构了它?
So you deconstruct it in a way?

107
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,600
是的，我们做到了。
Yeah, we did.

108
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,920
利亚姆:在伦敦的希尔顿公园巷酒店，
LIAM: At the Hilton Park Lane Hotel in London,

109
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,120
突破糕点界的界限是一种基本的精神
pushing the boundaries of patisserie is an essential ethos

110
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,040
伊曼纽尔和山姆的作品
of Emmanuel and Sam's work.

111
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,960
他们的前卫之旅，伊曼纽尔和山姆将
For their avant-garde roulade, Emmanuel and Sam will be

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,720
包裹着一层又一层的榛子蛋糕，
encasing layers of hazelnut dacquoise,

113
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,600
牛轧糖和国语果冻，
nougatine and Mandarin jelly,

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,680
榛子巧克力慕斯。
in a hazelnut chocolate mousse.

115
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,080
然而，他们遗漏了
However, they're omitting

116
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,360
一个值得注意的因素
one notable element

117
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,640
正常的卷饼。
of a normal roulade.

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,680
我们不要拐弯抹角了。
Let's not beat around the bush.

119
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,920
在你的旋转中有任何漩涡运动吗?
Is there any swirl movement within your roulade?

120
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,760
不像卷饼，是一圈一圈又一圈的。
It's not like the roulade, which is round and round and round.

121
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,000
所以我们让你做旋转，但你说，“你知道吗，
So we ask you to do roulade, but you say, "You know what,

122
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,000
“真该死……”不，不，不。“不要再跳了，我们不跳了。”
"sod it..." No, no, no, no. "No more roulade, we're not doing a roulade."

123
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,280
我们保留了层的概念。所以没有漩涡?
We kept the idea of the layers. So there is no swirl?

124
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,560
伯努瓦，求你放手吧!
Benoit, please let it go!

125
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,000
哦，天哪，天哪。
Oh, dear, dear.

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,640
很明显，对法官来说，我们的动作有点过了。
Our touch is a bit too much, obviously, for the judge.

127
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,120
这是……好的。
That's... OK.

128
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,840
我觉得他们觉得我们有点太冒险了。
I'm under the impression they think we're a bit too adventurous.

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,560
他们现在说什么都不会影响我们。
Whatever they say now doesn't really affect us.

130
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,040
我们必须尝试做一些与众不同的事情。
We've got to try and do something different from everybody else.

131
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,560
这是你赢的唯一办法。
It's the only way you're gonna win.

132
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,280
勉强通过最后一轮后……
After scraping through the last round...

133
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,240
你想尝尝这个吗?
Do you wanna just taste this?

134
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,080
更多的果仁糖。是的。
More praline. Yeah.

135
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,000
. .达里尔和巴拉特决定见面
..Darryl and Bharat are determined to meet

136
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,320
评委们的批评是正面的。
the judges' criticisms head on.

137
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,760
上周，我们认为他们会喜欢这些味道，
Last week, we thought they would have loved the flavours,

138
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,760
但显然他们没有。我们今天要给他们留下深刻印象。
but obviously they didn't. We're here to impress them today.

139
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,320
我们只是在执行任务。
We're just on a mission, basically.

140
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
我们会做到的。我们能行的，我们能行的!
We will do it. We can do it, we can do it!

141
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,160
跆拳道黑带，
A black belt in tae kwon do,

142
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,120
队长达里尔对被击倒并不陌生
team captain Darryl is no stranger to getting knocked down

143
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,240
然后回来战斗。
and coming back fighting.

144
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,400
他会用白巧克力榛子酱
He'll use a white chocolate hazelnut whip

145
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,040
再来一杯牛奶巧克力奶油
and a milk chocolate cream

146
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,600
创建一个双色填充
to create a two-tone filling

147
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,160
对于他的joconde海绵，
to his joconde sponge,

148
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,600
他会用香草和榛子调味。
which he'll flavour with vanilla and hazelnut.

149
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,440
因为坚果里的油，
Because of the oils in the nut,

150
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,640
它使它在滚动时很有弹性，不应该开裂。
it makes it quite elastic when it comes to rolling, shouldn't crack.

151
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,640
弹性可以帮助厨师做出想要的卷形。
Elasticity will help the chefs to achieve the desired roulade shape.

152
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,200
好吗?我很好，你呢?
OK? Yeah, I'm good, you?

153
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,880
是的,很好。但说到口感，
Yeah, good. But when it comes to texture,

154
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:46,600
Hideko和Theo希望他们的海绵能更上一层楼。
Hideko and Theo are hoping to take their sponge to the next level.

155
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,040
蛋糕部分是蛋奶酥底，就像松软的海绵蛋糕。
The cake part is a souffle base, like a fluffy, soft sponge cake.

156
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,840
这听起来像我以前做的日本海绵…
This sounds like the Japanese sponge I used to make...

157
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,520
完全正确!啊，我也这么想!
Exactly! Ah, I thought so!

158
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,840
英子15年前从日本来到英国
Hideko came to the UK from Japan 15 years ago

159
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,800
成为一名糕点师，她和一些
to become a pastry chef, and she's worked with some of the

160
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,760
英国烹饪界的大腕。
biggest names in British cuisine.

161
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,880
戈登·拉姆齐的第一副厨，
First sous-chef to Gordon Ramsay,

162
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,600
之后是赫斯顿·布卢门撒尔
and after this, Heston Blumenthal.

163
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,840
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

164
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,960
Hideko的日式蛋奶酥海绵
Hideko's Japanese souffle sponge

165
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
会用榛子奶油分层吗
will be layered with hazelnut cream

166
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,200
还有切碎的焦糖榛子。
and chopped caramelised hazelnuts.

167
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,280
她还加了香蒂伊奶油
She's also adding a Chantilly cream

168
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,480
沉浸在小说里
infused with a novel

169
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,760
甜点的味道。
dessert flavour.

170
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:44,080
因为这显然是一个插入，我需要冻结它
Cos this is obviously an insert, I need this to be frozen

171
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,680
然后尽快放入慕斯。
as soon as possible to then go inside the mousse.

172
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,520
这些会直接进入爆炸。
These are gonna go straight in the blast.

173
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,720
当山姆和伊曼纽尔的卷饼被放入冷冻机时…
While Sam and Emmanuel's roulade goes in the blast chiller...

174
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,080
快，快，快!
Go, go, go!

175
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,800
朱莉，我们准备好了…剩下的就可以放进烤箱了。
Julie, we're ready. ..the rest are ready to go in the oven.

176
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,720
我要做八层，看看效果如何。
I'll do eight layers and see how it comes out.

177
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,800
烤海绵卷的时间很关键。
The bake time for the roulade sponge is crucial.

178
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,200
我的是10。
I'm putting mine ten.

179
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
记得关上门的时候还有七分钟吗?
Remember it's on seven minutes when you close the door, yeah?

180
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,880
在烤箱里烤太久，海绵卷起来就会破裂，
Too long in the oven and the sponge will crack when it's rolled,

181
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,840
这样就不可能得到最重要的螺旋了。
making it impossible to get the all-important spiral.

182
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,600
祈祷!
Fingers crossed!

183
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,360
用海绵烤……
With sponges baking...

184
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,880
40分钟了。
40 minutes in.

185
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,040
. .是时候填馅了。
..it's on to fillings.

186
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,960
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,120
玛尔塔和朱莉在他们的节目中加入了危险的暗示。
And Marta and Julie are spicing theirs with a hint of danger.

188
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,240
我准备了汤卡豆泡奶油，
I've got my Tonka bean infused cream in there,

189
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:30,200
然后我就可以把它加到巧克力酱里了。
so then I can add it to the ganache.

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,640
唐卡豆有毒吗?
Tonka beans, are they poisonous?

191
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,680
如果你吃太多，它们是有毒的。
If you have it too much, they are poisonous.

192
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,640
杀人需要多少钱?
How much would you need to kill somebody?

193
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,960
我在找一个朋友。我不知道。
I'm asking for a friend. I don't know.

194
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,920
球队队长玛尔塔在拉夫堡开了一家糕点店
Team captain Marta opened Bom Bom Patisserie in Loughborough

195
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,320
两年前，
two years ago,

196
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,520
从生物学家转到面包师之后。
following a career switch from biologist to baker.

197
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,440
她的榛子松糕
Her hazelnut joconde sponge will be

198
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,760
装满了两个甘纳许
filled with two ganaches -

199
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,040
一个是榛子鞭子，
one, a hazelnut whip,

200
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,960
另一个是她的巧克力和唐卡豆。
the other, her chocolate and tonka bean.

201
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,160
这是你看到的质地吗?
Is this the texture that you're looking at?

202
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
看，那部分不光滑。
See, that bit is not smooth.

203
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:00,840
好的。我要让你自己纠正。
OK. I'm gonna let you rectify it yourself.

204
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,640
嗯，没什么压力。
Mm, nothing stressful about that.

205
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,880
Michael和Rebekah唯一感受到的压力是…
The only stress Michael and Rebekah are feeling...

206
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,080
他们唱
THEY SING

207
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,400
. .在他们的声带上。
..is on their vocal cords.

208
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,240
我们更像是一对老夫老妻，你不觉得吗?
We're definitely more like an old married couple, do you not think?

209
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,040
对，分床睡。是啊，就是这样一对夫妻!
Yeah, separate beds. Yeah, that kind of a married couple!

210
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,960
迈克尔和丽贝卡做了九年的朋友
Friends for nine years, Michael and Rebekah have spent

211
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,080
最后两个人在圣大卫酒店并肩工作
the last two working side-by-side at the St David's Hotel

212
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:25,560
在卡迪夫。
in Cardiff.

213
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,360
服务,请。
Service, please.

214
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,440
迈克尔的榛子巧克力海绵蛋糕
Michael's hazelnut Pain de Genes sponge

215
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,800
会被黑巧克力釉覆盖吗
will be covered with a dark chocolate glaze

216
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,600
里面装满了果仁巧克力酱
and filled with praline ganache

217
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:34,880
还有香蕉慕斯。
and a banana mousse.

218
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:37,080
我们做了香蕉慕斯，用保鲜膜包起来
We've made the banana mousse, rolled it in clingfilm

219
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,640
来制造又长又细的管子……会有一点点
to make really long, thin tubes... There'll be a little bit of

220
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,320
当你切开它的时候，里面会有惊喜。
a surprise inside when you slice it open.

221
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,800
所以这可能是获胜的板凳?
So this could be the winning bench?

222
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,000
联合第二。你唯一能走的路是更高……
Joint second. The only way you can go is higher...

223
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,480
我们要第一!就是这样。
We want first! That's it.

224
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,760
所以插入物被摩丝包围
So the insert's surrounded by the mousse

225
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,200
然后我要在它的底部放一个底。
and then I'm gonna have a base to go on the bottom of it.

226
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,160
那得剪小一点。
That'll need to be cut a little bit smaller.

227
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,760
大厨们，你们还有两个小时。
Chefs, you have two hours left.

228
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,720
两个小时。
Two hours.

229
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,600
希望我们在轨道上!
We are on track, hopefully!

230
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,120
不会比上周更糟了。
Can't be worse than last week.

231
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,880
还有两个小时，对吧?是的,是的。
Two hours to go, yeah? Yeah, yeah.

232
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,120
在爆炸中度过一个半小时是很好的。
It's good to get a good hour and a half in the blast.

233
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,680
希尔顿的游行队伍可能已经组装好了……
The Hilton's roulade may already be assembled...

234
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
定时器哔哔声对，就是我们。
TIMER BEEPS Right, that's us.

235
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,960
. .但对其他人来说，他们的首要任务是得到
..but for everyone else, their priority is getting

236
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,440
他们的海绵刚出炉…
their sponges is out of the oven...

237
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,080
热托盘在这里。是的。
Hot tray here. Yeah.

238
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,440
热，热，热。
Hot, hot, hot.

239
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
. .冷却到可以填充和卷起来。
..and cool enough to fill and roll.

240
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,680
进去吧，姑娘!
Get in there, girl!

241
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,440
照这样下去，我们有时间喝杯茶了!
We'll have time for a cuppa at this rate!

242
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,600
也就是说，如果这批完美的面包卷要求不够高，
That is, if the batch of perfect roulades wasn't demanding enough,

243
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:33,880
团队还需要创建他们的第二层切片。
the teams also need to create their second layered slice.

244
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,680
嗯，你可能认为提拉米苏很容易做
Well, you might think that tiramisu is easy to make

245
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,520
因为它随处可见。
because you can see it everywhere.

246
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,760
然而，要做到这一点太难了。
However, it is just so difficult to get right.

247
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,520
松糕海绵蛋糕必须烤得完美，
The ladyfinger sponge must be baked to perfection,

248
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,280
这样它们就能吸收所有美丽浓郁的咖啡糖浆。
so that they can soak up all the beautiful, intense coffee syrup.

249
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,520
我不想看到没有泡过的海绵，那样会很干。
I do not want to see an unsoaked sponge, it would be so dry.

250
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,320
然后是漂亮柔滑的马斯卡彭奶酪。
Then a beautiful, silky mascarpone cream.

251
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,800
用适量的明胶保持它的形状。
Use just enough gelatine to hold its form.

252
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:06,200
太多明胶了，你能想象吗?
Too much gelatine, can you imagine?

253
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,520
这可能看起来很简单，但它需要完美。
It might seem simple, but it needs to be perfect.

254
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,760
西奥正在为甜蜜艺术实验室制作提拉米苏。
Theo is creating the tiramisu for Sweet Art Lab.

255
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,640
希望我们能继续看到那些山脉，
We're gonna hopefully keep seeing all those, like, mountains,

256
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,880
所以我们要把形状弄直。
so we have to be really straight with our shaping.

257
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,320
厨房里的人，
Word round the kitchen,

258
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,320
你从来没做过提拉米苏。
you've actually never made a tiramisu before.

259
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,360
不完全是。如果我祖父母听到了，他们会杀了我的，
Not exactly. If my grandparents hear me, they'll kill me,

260
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,800
因为他们是意大利人，喜欢提拉米苏。
because they're Italian and love tiramisu.

261
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:34,360
那是什么?
What's that?

262
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,920
它对你有用吗?
Does it work with you?

263
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,520
你真性感。
You're pretty hot.

264
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,120
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

265
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,400
如果你要做提拉米苏，你首先要做的就是
If you're making a tiramisu, the first thing you want

266
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,640
被咖啡击中。
to be hit with is coffee.

267
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,440
但厨师们如何引入咖啡的味道可能是关键。
But how the chefs introduce the coffee flavour could prove key.

268
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,320
那是你能找到的最好的咖啡。
That is the finest coffee you can find.

269
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,120
这是雀巢速溶咖啡。
It's Nescafe instant coffee.

270
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,480
咖啡利口酒给你咖啡，
Coffee liqueur to give you that coffee,

271
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,520
但只要喝一点酒，就会有很大的刺激。
but a little bit of alcohol, plenty of alcohol kick.

272
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,760
那将是一个……
That'll be one...

273
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,120
基本上，我们会把它们都放进去。
Basically, we'll put it all in.

274
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,680
一瓶半。
Bottle and a half.

275
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,080
派对时间!
Party time!

276
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,720
小手指准备好了。
Ladyfinger is ready.

277
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,760
我对我的手指松饼很满意。
I'm pretty happy with my ladyfingers.

278
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,560
又脆又干，能吸收咖啡利口酒的味道。
They're crisp, they're dry, so it actually absorbs the coffee liqueur.

279
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,360
我觉得海绵干的时候会很不舒服。
I think the sponge when it's dry, it can be quite unpleasant.

280
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,480
也不能浸泡太久，
You can't soak it too much as well,

281
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,800
否则你的酒吧就不能正常运作了?
otherwise your bar is not going to hold straight, you know?

282
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,280
很难找到适量的糖浆。
It's quite hard to find the right amount of syrup to put.

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,520
这都是我第三次灌满这瓶了，
This is like the third time I've refilled this bottle,

284
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,160
所以它占据了相当多的空间。
so it has taken up quite a lot.

285
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,560
我在准备马斯卡朋慕斯的原料。
I'm preparing the ingredients for the mascarpone mousse.

286
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,200
250.
250.

287
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,520
往马斯卡彭奶酪里加明胶
Adding gelatine to the mascarpone

288
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,760
会帮助他们的切片保持形状。
will help their slices keep their shape.

289
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,960
你的马斯卡彭鞭子怎么样了?
How's your mascarpone whip coming out, nice?

290
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,880
哦，是的，很好。
Oh, yeah, it's good.

291
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,880
但太多的话，厨师就会失去奶油味
But too much and the chefs will lose the creaminess Cherish

292
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:56,240
正在寻找。
is looking for.

293
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,320
我要用迷你秤，这样更精确。
I've got to use a mini scale, which is a touch more precise.

294
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,560
不满足于解构面包卷……
Not content with deconstructing the roulade...

295
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,000
不，我也没见过这样的卷饼。
No, I don't think I've ever seen a roulade like this either.

296
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,200
. .伊曼纽尔和山姆也在改造提拉米苏
..Emmanuel and Sam are also reinventing the tiramisu

297
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,960
通过添加一个不寻常的元素。
by adding an unusual element.

298
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,120
咖啡果冻。
Coffee jelly.

299
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,600
把它放在海绵的顶部，然后我们就有了这一层
It's got to go on the top of the sponge, then we have the layer

300
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,960
马斯。
of mascarpone.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,520
萨姆，我们还能准时吗?不知道。这很好。
Sam, how are we doing on time? No idea. That's good.

302
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,000
每一层都需要在放置下一层之前设置好。
Each layer needs to be set before you put the next thing.

303
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,240
如果没有很好地定型，你就不能切得很干净，
If it's not set nicely, you can't get a clean cut,

304
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,520
我们都知道珍爱喜欢漂亮干净的发型。
and we all know Cherish loves a nice, clean cut.

305
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,320
这是马斯卡朋奶酪的第一层。
This is the first layer of the mascarpone.

306
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,640
又平又漂亮，是吧?第二层小手指饼干。
Nice and flat, eh? Second layer of ladyfinger biscuit.

307
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,960
需要尽快把它放进冰箱。
Need to have it as as soon as possible in the freezer.

308
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,960
现在有点吃力，我得把这些塞进去。
Bit of a push now, I need to get these in.

309
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,480
我现在要去冷冻机那里。
I'm going to the blast chiller now.

310
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,320
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

311
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,520
朱莉，朱莉，我们有麻烦了。
Julie, Julie, we're gonna have a problem.

312
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,680
这个大托盘放不下。
That big tray doesn't fit in here.

313
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,560
没关系，我把它放在冰箱里。
That's fine, I'll put it in the freezer.

314
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,080
选择模具的时间太长了，
Having chosen moulds too long for the blast freezer,

315
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,360
朱莉把它们放在普通的冰箱里。
Julie puts them in a normal freezer.

316
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,120
但现在她的提拉米苏需要更长的时间来定型。
But now her tiramisu will take longer to set.

317
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,280
哦,好吧。我们现在也无能为力了，对吧?
Oh, well. Not a lot we could do about it now, is there?

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,040
大厨们，你们还有半小时。
Chefs, you have half an hour left.

319
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,960
半小时，Hideko。是的。
Half an hour, Hideko. Yeah.

320
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,440
我在准备卷饼。
Just getting the roulades ready to roll.

321
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,280
那又回来了!它回来了，宝贝。
That is back! It's back baby.

322
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,200
巧克力酱又回来了!
Ganache is back!

323
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:15,080
要把图层分开，因为擀面的时候，
Just gonna get my layers separated, because when you roll it,

324
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,520
不管怎样，它会推动整个过程。
it's gonna push it altogether, anyway.

325
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,920
关键时刻。
Pivotal moment.

326
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,560
关键时刻。
Crucial moment.

327
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,400
开始滚动。
Start rolling.

328
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,800
这是香蕉慕斯。
This is the banana mousse.

329
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,440
它会粘在中间。
It'll stick in the centre.

330
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,520
这样，当你滚动的时候，你可以保持它很好很紧。
That way, when you're rolling, you can keep it nice and tight.

331
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
啊。
Ah.

332
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,400
他们看到我在打滚，他们就恨我。
They see me rollin', they hatin'.

333
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,040
他们看到我在翻滚……＃
# They see me rollin'... #

334
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,760
对不起,厨师。
Sorry, chef.

335
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,120
哦，啦，啦。
Oh, la, la.

336
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,320
在烤箱里烤太久了，太干了。
It stayed too long in the oven, it's too dry.

337
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:03,960
我卷的时候它有点裂，但螺旋还是有的。
It cracked a little bit as I was rolling it, but the spiral's there.

338
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,400
你想把它冷却到哪里?冰箱。
Where do you want this chilling to? Freezer.

339
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,720
完美。在冷风机里很快就会熟了。
Perfection. It's gonna go quickly in the blast chiller.

340
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,440
可以切片，但如果温度再低一点，效果会更好。
It's sliceable, but you'll get a better finish if it's cooler.

341
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,360
试着把下一层硅去掉。
Try and take the next layer of silicon off.

342
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,040
现在冻得更快了。
It's gonna freeze even quicker now.

343
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,120
我们的时间不多了。
We haven't got that much longer.

344
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,080
提拉米苏刚从冰箱里拿出来。
The tiramisu has just come out of the chiller.

345
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,240
我们要在上面撒点可可粉。
We're just gonna dust it with a bit of cocoa powder.

346
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,040
它们已经凝固在上面，准备上釉了。
They've set on top, ready for the glaze.

347
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:26,000
加热一下，这样我就可以把提拉米苏从模具里拿出来了。
Just heating it up, so I can take the tiramisu out of the mould.

348
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,000
你可别把它烧过了头
Got to make sure you don't over blowtorch it

349
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,600
因为它可以融化侧面。
cos it can actually melt the sides.

350
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,840
哦,哦!朱莉，朱莉，朱莉!哦。
Oh, oh! Julie, Julie, Julie! Oh.

351
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,920
洞里有火!
Fire in the hole!

352
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,400
这是关键时刻。
This is the crucial moment.

353
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,080
看看这一层是不是直的。
See all the layer and if it's straight or not.

354
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,640
哦，别这样。
Oh, come on.

355
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,360
请不要那样做。
Don't do that, please.

356
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,640
压力。评委们肯定会很严厉，
Pressure on. Judges are gonna be tough for sure,

357
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,120
所以一定要做到完美。
so have to be perfect.

358
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,840
完成了。快乐吗?
Done. Happy?

359
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,040
我想是的。完美的。
I think so. Perfect.

360
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:54,480
看起来不错。这就是我想要的，清晰可见的图层。
It looks all right. That's what I wanted, the layer I can clearly see.

361
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,720
说实话，我对此很满意。
I'm pretty happy with this, to be honest.

362
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,960
分层很好，不是吗?
Layers are good, eh?

363
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,920
还是软的吗?是的。
Is that still soft? Yeah.

364
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,480
我想把它从模子里拿出来，这样我就可以把它放回去了
I want to get it out of the mould so I can get it back in

365
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,280
冷冻室。好，你就这么做了。
the blast freezer. OK, so you do that.

366
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,240
大厨们，你们还有十分钟。
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

367
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,600
我们还有十分钟。
We've got ten minutes.

368
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
要开始分装了。
Gonna start to portion up.

369
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,000
尽量让它保持干净。
Try to keep it as clean as you can.

370
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:22,600
把它翻转过来，把它折起来，
By turning it on its side and having it doubled up,

371
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,920
现在只用一半的时间就做好了六层。
you've now got six layers in half the time.

372
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,040
这是一块很厚的海绵。
It's quite a thick sponge.

373
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:30,120
可能有点涨得太大了。
It's risen maybe a little bit too much.

374
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,880
看起来有点方。
It's looking a bit square.

375
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,520
哦，我明白你的意思了。它是替代。
Oh, I see what you mean. It's alternative.

376
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,640
我们只希望它尝起来好吃。
We just hope that it'll taste good.

377
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,880
我正在为舞会做装饰。
Just making the decor for the roulade now.

378
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,680
我需要稍微冷却一下。
I need to cool it down a little bit.

379
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,440
如果太热，它就不会像这样掉下来。
If it's too hot, it's not gonna do the drop like that.

380
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,160
你还好吗，Darryl?有个麻烦的切片。
Are you all right, Darryl? Got a troublesome slice.

381
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:55,960
我在想它们会不会待在温暖的地方。
Just wondering if they're gonna stay where they are in the warmth.

382
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,240
它很软。
It's very soft.

383
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,320
还是软的吗?
Is that still soft?

384
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,840
继续切，我来把它切完，好吗?
Keep on cutting it and I'll finish this off, OK?

385
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,160
我们还有多长时间?
How long do we have?

386
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,720
大厨们，你们还有五分钟，五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes, five minutes left.

387
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,240
哎呀，这一拳打中了指关节。
Crikey, this one's to the knuckle.

388
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,680
坚持到最后，最后一分钟。是的。
Go to the end, last minute. Yeah.

389
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,160
不过它下得真快。
It's really setting quick, though.

390
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,520
小心你的背。热,热。
Mind your back. Hot, hot.

391
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,880
我在用马斯卡彭奶酪做罗谢尔奶酪。
I'm doing some rochelles with some mascarpone.

392
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,520
我的收尾还可以再好一点，但现在就是这样。
My finishing could be a bit better, but it is where it is right now.

393
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,800
啊,啊。
Ah, ah.

394
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:27,120
你还好吗?
You OK there?

395
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,520
我们在噼啪作响吗?继续，汤米。
Are we crackalackin'? Rock on, Tommy.

396
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,960
需要加快工作速度。
Need to work faster.

397
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
4,8,12,16,20。
4, 8, 12, 16, 20.

398
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:35,800
我们需要再加四个。
We need to get another four on.

399
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,600
我们会及时完成的，总会有结果的。
We'll get it done in time, something will come out.

400
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,200
大厨们，你们还有一分钟!
Chefs, you have one minute left!

401
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,040
哔哔声。一分钟。
BLEEP. One minute.

402
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,680
我可能需要点推动力，达瑞尔。
I might need a bit of a push, Darryl.

403
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,040
我一穿上巧克力，就来找你。
Soon as I get my chocolate on, I'll be with you.

404
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:53,400
你在做巧克力吗?我在做巧克力。
Are you doing the chocolate? I'm doing the chocolate.

405
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,920
先把饼干拿过来。
Just get the biscuit first.

406
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,480
我们开始吧。
Let's do this.

407
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,520
时间到了，大厨们!
Time's up, chefs!

408
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:02,280
离你的手指远点。
Step away from your ladyfingers.

409
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,560
哦!谢天谢地总算结束了。我们只希望他们能熬夜。
Oh! Thank God that's over. Let's just hope they stay up.

410
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,960
也许把它放下。
Maybe lay it down, yeah.

411
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,000
太可怕了。
That was horrendous.

412
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,200
参赛队伍现在必须展示他们的48层切片
The teams must now present their 48 layered slices

413
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,480
有请评委Benoit和珍惜
to judges Benoit and Cherish.

414
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,080
名胜世界的Darryl和Bharat，
Darryl and Bharat from Resorts World,

415
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,680
你能过来一下吗?
could you please come forward?

416
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
所以，你的面包卷。
So, your roulade.

417
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,080
我喜欢你的努力
I like the fact that you have tried

418
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,320
用你的两种馅料做一个图案。
to do a pattern with your two fillings.

419
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,920
总的来说，我认为这看起来有点粗暴。
As a whole, I think it looks a little bit heavy-handed.

420
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,680
最大的错误是海绵的厚度。
The biggest mistake is the thickness of your sponge.

421
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,760
但我喜欢你的馅料。
But I like the texture of your filling.

422
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,800
我得到了对比，这实际上是令人愉快的。
I've got contrast, and it's actually pleasant.

423
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,360
来看看你的提拉米苏切片。
Well, let's look at your tiramisu slice.

424
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,640
我真的很喜欢那种小小的心灵抚摸。
I really like the small touch of the heart.

425
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,040
这有什么意义吗?
Is there any meaning to it?

426
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,280
只是纯粹的爱。
Just pure love.

427
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,360
你一个，你一个。
Aw, one from you and one from you.

428
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,120
嗯…我觉得它尝起来确实像提拉米苏。
Well...I think it does taste like a tiramisu.

429
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,400
唷!
Phew!

430
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,280
我很喜欢你放进去的咖啡糖浆，
And I really like your coffee syrup that you put in,

431
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,920
我觉得它很美。
I think it's beautiful.

432
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,000
海绵的第一层，在这里，完全浸透了。
The first layer of your sponge, over here, is just perfectly soaked.

433
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,200
和上次相比，你想说的是，
Compared to the last heat, you're trying really to say,

434
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,920
“等一下，我们有条件。”
"Hang on a minute, we have what it takes."

435
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,400
非常感谢，先生们。谢谢你！
Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thank you.

436
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,640
嗯。一些积极的方面。是的。
Mmm. Some positives. Yeah.

437
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
没关系的。
It's all right.

438
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,000
请糕点师邦邦过来好吗?
Can Bom Bom Patisserie please come forward?

439
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
来吧，老板。
Come on then, boss.

440
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,560
从视觉上看，我们看到的更像是方形的卷饼。
On the visual, we've got more of a squarish roulade.

441
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,400
谁能给我来杯建筑工人茶?
Can somebody bring me a cup of builder tea?

442
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,600
我要把这个泡进去。
I need to dunk this in.

443
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,720
天气太干燥了。
It was just so dry.

444
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,760
我觉得你所创造的一切，
I think what you've managed to create,

445
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:22,440
因为加入了汤卡豆，实际上是令人愉快的。
because of the addition of the tonka bean, is actually pleasant.

446
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,560
但它是干燥的。
But it is dry.

447
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,280
我们继续，
So, moving on swiftly,

448
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,040
你把马斯卡彭奶酪的顶部露出来了
you are exposing the top of your mascarpone

449
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,240
而且看起来不太吸引人。
and it doesn't look very appealing.

450
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,040
我试图寻找提拉米苏的美丽侧面，
I was trying to search for the beautiful profile of a tiramisu,

451
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,920
我在这里找不到
and I could not find it in here.

452
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,440
所有的东西都干巴巴的。
Everything is dry and claggy.

453
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
谢谢你！谢谢你！
Thank you. Thank you.

454
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,800
有什么原因让你躺下吗?
Is there any reason why you lie down your roulade?

455
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,360
我们试着让它站起来，然后它倒了一点。
We tried to make it stand and then it fell down a bit.

456
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,080
从视觉上看，它并不是最吸引人的。
Visually, it's not the most attractive.

457
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,000
我觉得很好。谢谢你！
I think it's nice. Thank you.

458
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,040
海绵是……
The sponge is...

459
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:23,480
榛子随处可见，我很喜欢。
I find the hazelnut everywhere, and I love that.

460
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,680
但我觉得你放了迷迭香。
But I think you put in rosemary.

461
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,760
是的，非常微妙。
Yeah, it's very subtle.

462
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,760
啐。一去不复返了。
Pfft. Gone.

463
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:32,040
现在来点提拉米苏。
Now, the tiramisu.

464
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,040
我喜欢海绵被管起来的想法。
I like the idea of the sponge being piped.

465
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,080
旁边……
Beside that...

466
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,480
. .它真的很厚。
..it's really a slab.

467
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,840
我喜欢你马斯卡彭奶酪的口感。
I like the texture of your mascarpone cream.

468
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,320
不过，底部的部分我不太喜欢，太干了。
The bottom part, though, I did not enjoy, too dry.

469
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,280
我只是很想吃提拉米苏的味道，我就是尝不出。
I was just craving for the tiramisu flavour, I just could not taste it.

470
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,480
非常感谢。再见。谢谢你！
Thank you very much. See you later. Thank you.

471
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,640
做得很好。谢谢。
Well done. Thanks.

472
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:00,160
希尔顿公园巷，请上前。
Hilton Park Lane, please come forward.

473
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,360
哦,啦啦啦啦啦啦啦啦。
Oh, la-la-la-la-la.

474
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,440
好的。那么，这个卷饼。
OK. So, the roulade.

475
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,080
我本希望看到一块烤好的海绵卷起来。
I would have hoped to see a sheet of baked sponge rolled on itself.

476
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,880
这是卷饼吗?我不太确定。
Is this a roulade? I'm not too sure.

477
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:22,040
你是不是太过分了?
Did you take it too far?

478
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,360
让我们试一试。让我们试一试。
Let's try. Let's have a go.

479
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,440
你做了很多工作。
You've done a lot of work.

480
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:32,280
你会把所有这些都滚在一起吗?
Would you have done all those rolled on each other...

481
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,640
. .你的味道混合得很好。
..you had a fantastic flavour combination there.

482
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,560
爱它，爱它，爱它。
Love it, love it, love it.

483
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,760
然而，我要炒蛋，你给我煎蛋卷。
However, I asked for scrambled egg, you give me omelette.

484
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,080
现在来点提拉米苏。
Now, the tiramisu.

485
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,720
就演示而言，我很高兴。
Presentation-wise, I'm happy.

486
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,480
我试图捕捉吃提拉米苏的感觉，
I was trying to capture the sensation of eating a tiramisu,

487
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,200
柔滑的马斯卡彭奶酪。
the creamy, silky mascarpone cream.

488
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,680
嗯。
Hmm.

489
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,960
我没有。
I didn't have that.

490
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,440
切片里的明胶太多了。
It's too much gelatine in the slice.

491
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
谢谢你！再见。
Thank you. See you later.

492
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:08,720
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

493
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:12,200
圣大卫酒店的迈克尔和丽贝卡，请站出来。
Michael and Rebekah from St David's Hotel, please come forward.

494
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,280
这就是我说的。
This is what I'm talking about.

495
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,120
一个漂亮的漩涡运动。
A nice swirl movement.

496
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,200
看起来很有吸引力。
It looks appealing.

497
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:32,840
我只是觉得香蕉
I just felt that the banana actually

498
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,760
盖过了卷的味道。
overtakes the flavour of the roulade.

499
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
提拉米苏。
The tiramisu.

500
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,280
作为一个整体，切片，有点基本。
As a whole, the slice, a little bit basic.

501
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,320
我们来尝尝吧?
Shall we taste?

502
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,480
这部分是完全干燥的。
This part here is completely dry.

503
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:53,120
我只是希望你能多加点糖浆。
I was just hoping that you use syrup a little bit more.

504
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,000
不是“a little bit more”，而是“更多”。
Not "a little bit more", more.

505
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,840
因为它根本没有浸泡过。
Because it's not been soaked at all.

506
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,760
我不太喜欢吃你的提拉米苏，抱歉，伙计们。
I did not really enjoy eating your tiramisu, sorry, guys.

507
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:05,000
非常感谢。谢谢你！我们一会儿见。
Thank you very much. Thank you. We'll see you later.

508
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,040
它们看起来和我的感觉一样。
They look how I feel.

509
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,800
我觉得是因为你全身心投入了。
I think it's because you put your heart into it.

510
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:21,880
我忍不住笑了。
REBEKAH LAUGHS I can't help laughing.

511
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,640
对着蛋糕哭，就像。
BLEEP crying over a cake, like.

512
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,560
这只是蛋糕而已，亲爱的。
It's only cake, love.

513
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,600
这只是一块蛋糕。
It's only cake.

514
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,840
这太残忍了。
That was brutal.

515
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,040
现在回想起来，事情会简单得多
Looking back on it, it would have been a lot easier

516
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,520
像转圈圈一样转圈圈那样会有帮助的。是的。
to do the roulade as a roulade. That would have helped. Yep.

517
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,080
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

518
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,400
我知道会有很多镜头。
I knew a lot of shooting was going to come.

519
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,880
是的。从珍爱开始。
Yeah. And it did from Cherish.

520
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,720
对每个人来说都有点复杂。所以我认为一切都是开放的
THEO: A bit mixed for everyone. So I think everything is still open

521
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,520
我认为明天将是至关重要的一天。
and I think tomorrow is going to be a crucial day.

522
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,640
从一到十，我打七分。
On a scale of one to ten, I'm a seven.

523
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,120
我不打算再高了，因为它可能
I'm not going to go any higher than that, because it might all

524
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,640
明天退学，我就只剩1分了。
drop out tomorrow and I'll be down to a one.

525
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
各队今晚有一个黄金时间
The teams have been given a golden hour this evening

526
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,040
为了在明天的巨大挑战中领先一步。
to get ahead for tomorrow's monumental challenge.

527
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,160
那么，在所有的团队中，谁做得最好?
So, out of all the teams, who's done the best?

528
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,360
度假村世界为自己感到骄傲。
Resort World have done themselves proud.

529
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,960
上次有眼泪，
There was tears last time,

530
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,040
但他们今天带来了两个强大的微型挑战。
but they have delivered two strong miniature challenge today.

531
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,560
这周你担心的是哪支球队?
And what teams are you worried about this week?

532
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,280
我在圣大卫酒店的同事们。
My little colleagues from the St David's Hotel.

533
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
这是一场两半场的比赛，
It's a game of two halves with them,

534
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:27,320
因为只有它们才能呈现出可爱的漩涡。
because they are the only roulade which presents that lovely swirl.

535
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,080
然而，切片里没有提拉米苏的味道。
However, there's no sensation of the tiramisu in the slice.

536
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,880
对我来说，我真的很担心邦邦，
For me, I'm really worried about the Bom Bom,

537
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,280
因为对他们来说，今天并没有走到一起。
because it didn't quite come together today for them.

538
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
真令人失望。
What a disappointment.

539
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,240
那么，你想在明天的展览中看到什么呢?
So, what do you want to see in tomorrow's showpiece?

540
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,600
它必须是巨大的，它必须是惊人的。
It needs to be huge, it needs to be amazing.

541
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,360
我们只希望球队明天能彻底摧毁它，
Let's just hope the teams absolutely wreck it tomorrow,

542
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,200
我想看到厨房里的疯狂。
I want to see madness in the kitchen.

543
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:53,280
什么是“毁掉它”?“wreck”的意思是，砸了它，把它做好。
What is "wreck it"? Like, wreck it means, like, smash it, do it well.

544
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,120
早....早....早....早....
Morning. Morning. Morning. Morning.

545
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,000
早上好，厨师们。
Good morning, chefs.

546
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:18,000
今天，评委们想让你做一个表演，
Today, the judges would like you to make an occasion showpiece,

547
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,080
大到足以养活至少36个人，
big enough to feed at least 36 people,

548
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,960
以松饼的形式。一厢情愿。
in the form of a croquembouche. Gesundheit.

549
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:30,160
传统上，松饼是做成圆锥形的。
Traditionally, a croquembouche is constructed in the shape of a cone.

550
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,320
但我们今天不想在厨房里看到传统。
But we do not want to see tradition in this kitchen today.

551
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:38,280
让它更现代，围绕一个主题。
Make it modern and build it around a theme.

552

我想被你的味道所打动。

厨师们，你们昨晚只有一个小时准备，

哦,是的。UN-professionals。

祝你好运。祝你好运。
Good luck. Good luck.

563
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,760
我们开始吧。
Let's do this.

564
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,200
松饼是一种精心装饰的
A croquembouche is an elaborately decorated,

565
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,520
圆锥形的塔是用法式泡芙包做成的，
cone-shaped tower made with creme-patissiere-filled choux buns,

566
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,800
用焦糖粘在一起。
glued together with caramel.

567
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:20,400
在法国，它们传统上被用作婚礼蛋糕。
In France, they are traditionally served as wedding cakes.

568
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,000
我妻子仍然对我怀恨在心
My wife still holds a little grudge on me

569
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:26,280
我们的婚礼上还没做蛋糕。
not having done a croquembouche for our own wedding.

570
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,560
当然，很多事情都可能出错，比如烤松饼。
Many things can go wrong, of course, with the croquembouche.

571
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,840
我要脸红了。
I'm going to blush, here.

572
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,040
如果配料的比例不对
If you've got the wrong ratio of ingredients

573
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,960
在你的糕点奶油里，你可能会有一些东西
within your pastry cream, you may end up having something

574
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,880
块状或软软的，除了奶油味。
lumpy or gummy, everything but very creamy.

575
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,560
小心你的头。
Mind your head.

576
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
泡芙要烤到完美，
The choux needs to be baked to perfection,

577
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,280
否则整个结构就会坍塌。
or the structure will collapse.

578
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,920
我希望厨师能在这个挑战中发挥创意。
I would like the chef to be very creative with this challenge.

579
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,120
技能是至关重要的。
Technical skill is crucial.

580
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,080
这都是关于惊喜因素。
It's all about the wow factor.

581
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:02,200
我想说，“为什么我之前没有想到这一点?”
I want to be saying, "Why didn't I think of that before?"

582
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,560
你是怎么定定时器的?四个小时，对吧?是的。
What did you set the timer? Four hours, yeah? Yep.

583
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,880
这两支球队的当代风格是法式松饼
The teams' contemporary take on a croquembouche

584
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,440
必须有一个创新的形状。
must have an innovative shape.

585
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,640
所以除了他们在泡芙和糖方面的天赋…
So as well as their talent with choux and sugar work...

586
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,160
爆炸。这就是我们需要的。
Bang. That's what we needed.

587
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,360
. .这也将是一项艰巨的考验
..it will also be a daunting test

588
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,480
他们在设计和工程方面的技能。

HIDEKO:

我通常在任何地方、任何情况下睡觉。
I normally sleep anywhere, any condition.

592
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,680
我做过的最高的蛋糕是松糕，
Tallest cake I ever made was a croquembouche,

593
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,280
但那是很多年前的事了。
but that's years and years ago.

594
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,440
经过昨天的事，我想这次我们需要挽回一下自己。
After yesterday, I think we need to redeem ourselves on this one.

595
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:38,920
伊曼纽尔和萨姆的展品将放在一个漂亮的牛格力底座上，

597
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,560
还有桔子甜酒和橘子酒。

598
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,680
对于它的形状，他们雄心勃勃地选择了一个球体。
For its shape, they have ambitiously chosen a sphere.

599
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,560
你选择的结构并不容易。
The structure you have chosen is not an easy one.

600
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,560
你舒服吗?我们不舒服。
You are comfortable? We're not comfortable.

601
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,440
好。我们肯定会再一次把自己置于这样的境地，
Good. We definitely put ourselves, again, in a situation,

602
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,800
我们想要挑战自我。
where we want to challenge ourselves.

603
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,560
你练过多少次了?三次，我想说。
How many times have you practised? Three times, I would say.

604
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,960
说实话，有两次，牛轧糖都崩溃了。
To be honest, two times, the nougatine collapsed.

他们的设计，Hideko和Theo

607

608
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,920
它看起来像一个立方体塔。

00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,840
三层。

But what is the theme?

615
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,160
这是一种新的现代风格。
It's a new, modern style.

616
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,120
但是，新的现代风格是一个主题吗?
But is new, modern style a theme?

617
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:42,280
你准备好了吗?是的，请把它传给我。好了。
Are you ready? Yeah, pass it on to me, please. There you go.

类似的东西?它的结构是菠萝。

Oh, there's a crack, there.

650
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,280
我要解决这个问题。
I'm going to fix that.

651
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,360
迈克尔和丽贝卡的设计灵感…
For their design, Michael and Rebecca's inspiration...

652
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,680
呃，啪……就在他们家门口。
Ugh, splat. ..was right on their doorstep.

653
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,000
我们经常在酒店喝下午茶什么的，
We do a lot of afternoon teas and stuff at the hotel,

654
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,960
所以我们的主题是下午茶。
so our theme is afternoon tea.

655
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,680
两个巨大的牛轧糖轮子，
Featuring two giant nougatine wheels,

656
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,160
装饰着手工制作的糖茶具，
adorned with a handcrafted sugar tea set,

657
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:25,640
里面塞满了伯爵茶和凝块奶油口味的面包，
and filled with their Earl Grey and clotted cream flavoured buns,

658
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,400
他们气势恢宏的作品将被放在一个展台上
their imposing creation will sit on a stand

659
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,600
由七层泡芙制成。
made from seven layers of choux.

660
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,720
大概会有这么高。
Roughly, it'll probably be about that high.

661
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,520
完全没有压力，一点都没有。
No pressure at all, none whatsoever.

662
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,080
大厨们，你们还有三个小时，三个小时。
Chefs, you have three hours left, three hours.

663
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
我在做牛轧糖。
HIDEKO: I am cooking nougatine.

664
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,960
它的基础是糖和葡萄糖，还有杏仁。
It's based on sugar and glucose, as well as almond.

665
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,880
牛轧糖是一个关键的结构元素，
Nougatine is a key structural element,

666
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,960
但塑造它可能很棘手。
but moulding it can be tricky.

667
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,680
伊曼纽尔:你需要知道什么时候使用它。
EMMANUEL: You need to know when to use it.

668
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,760
当它太热的时候，试着用它是没有意义的。
There's no point to try to use it when it's too hot.

669
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,480
因为它粘在任何东西上。
Because it sticks to everything.

670
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,640
它冷却下来，焦糖凝固，你不能做任何事情。
It cools down and caramel sets and you can't do anything out of it.

671
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:04,560
牛轧糖冷却后迅速硬化
With the nougatine hardening rapidly as it cools...

672
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,920
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

673
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,880
. .速度是最重要的。
..speed is of the essence.

674
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,960
朱莉，快点。
Julie, get a move on.

675
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,360
他们吃的牛轧糖越多，速度就越快。
And the more nougatine they have, the quicker they have to be.

676
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,840
我们的展台大概有十层楼高，
Our stand is going to be about ten levels high,

677
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,240
所以我们需要很多牛轧糖。
so we need a lot of nougatine.

678
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,600
我的问题是，我有点慢，所以在我塑造它们之前它们就凝固了。
My problem is, I'm a bit slow so they set before I can shape them.

679
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,240
哦，该死的。
Oh, bloody hell.

680
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,720
正确的,那么。回到烤箱里。
Right, then. Back in the oven.

681
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,000
哦,朱莉。
Oh, Julie.

682
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
重新融化牛轧糖需要时间。
Re-melting the nougatine will take time.

683
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,680
我得抓紧时间了。他们没有时间。
I'm going to have to get a move on. Time they don't have.

684
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,840
把我的车底打开。
Get me bottom into gear.

685
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:48,320
还有一个半小时，大厨们。还有90分钟。
An hour and a half left, chefs. 90 minutes left.

686
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:51,600
离集合还有一个小时。好吗?是的。
Got an hour until assembly. OK? Yeah.

687
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:54,200
当朱莉与她的牛轧糖搏斗时……
While Julie wrestles with her nougatine...

688
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:56,240
两个搞定了，还有十个。
Two done, ten to go.

689
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,640
. .其他队……看看打蛋器的大小。
..the other teams... Look at the size of your whisk.

690
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,760
. .转向泡芙的馅料。
..turn to fillings for their choux.

691
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,480
我们要把开心果酱加到糕点奶油里。
We are going to add the pistachio paste to the pastry cream.

692
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:07,440
一个是黑醋栗和栗子，一个是抹茶，
One's going to be cassis and chestnut, one is going to be matcha,

693
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,560
一种是黑白调味料。
and one is going to be white and dark seasoning.

694
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:13,440
你切泡芙的方式，我想看到颜色上的惊喜。
The way you cut choux, I want to see a little surprise in the colour.

695
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,840
这是爱尔兰奶油。上周，珍爱觉得这里有点太醉了，
This is the Irish cream. Last week, Cherish found it a bit too boozy,

696
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,440
所以希望这周不会那么糟糕。
so hopefully, it's not as bad this week.

697
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,960
它们真的有那么大吗?我不知道什么尺寸合适!
Are they meant to be that big? I don't know what the right size is!

698
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,600
如果你切开，希望你能看到我在中间搅拌的橘子胶。
If you cut through, hopefully, you'll see the mandarin gel that I'm piping in the middle.

699
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,720
你只是想要一点点，不是吗?一团，这样他们就能尝到了。
You just want a little dollop in there, don't you? A blob, so they can taste it.

700
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,440
加油，伙计，加油，加油!我得把这些弄清楚。
Come on, mate, come on, chop, chop! I've got to get these ones right.

701
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,040
这是我的菠萝凝胶，我把它放进去，
That's my pineapple gel, so I'll insert it in,

702
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,280
然后我把椰子和酸橙蛋奶冻放上去。
and then I put the coconut and lime custard on.

703
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:52,120
来吧。还有一小时，大厨们。你有一个小时。
Come on. One hour left, chefs. You have one hour.

704
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:55,200
正确的,那么。继续，汤米。开始做松饼的外壳，
Right, then. Rock on, Tommy. Starting to build the croquembouche shell,

705
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,800
用焦糖粘在一起。
just stick it together with caramel.

706
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,240
这是很关键的一步，因为其他一切都在这一步之上。
Kind of a crucial stage, cos everything else will be sat on top of this.

707
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,040
设计越复杂……朱莉的集中注意力。
The more complex the design... Julie's concentrating.

708
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,320
她现在不能说话。
She can't talk right now.

709
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,280
. .组装的风险就越大。
..the riskier it will be to assemble.

710
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:09,720
你得到的太多了。去容易。
You've got way too much. Go easy.

711
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,840
哪一个是第一个?
Which one's first?

712
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,720
这条是最直的。
This one is the straightest one.

713
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,360
对的,好吧。准备好了吗?
Right, OK. Ready?

714
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,440
玛尔塔和朱莉，我很喜欢这个结构
Marta and Julie, I quite like the structure

715
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,640
他们会为我们提供住宿。
they're going to put up for us.

716
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:21,600
这是一个菠萝。这很有趣。
It's a pineapple. It's quite intriguing.

717
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,800
他们会成功吗?我们不知道。
Will they manage to pull it off? We don't know.

718
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,000
别动，别动。一旦开了，就开了。
Don't move, don't move. Once it's on, it's on.

719
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,720
像这样把它们粘起来。扫描。
Stick those like this. Sweep up.

720
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,680
我不相信。它是三个立方体堆叠在一起。
I'm not convinced. It's three cubes stacked on each other.

721
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:37,920
这是个简单的设计。那么，希尔顿公园巷怎么样?
It's a simple design. So, what about the Hilton Park Lane?

722
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,160
他们做的松饼有点冒险。
Their croquembouche is kind of a risky business.

723
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,800
他们成功了三次，却坍塌了两次!哇!哦吼!
They've made it three times and it collapsed twice! Wow! Woohoo!

724
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,080
我快没时间了。
I'm running out of time.

725
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,560
我应该已经在第二个半球上了。
I should already be on the second half-sphere.

726
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,200
放松。我去喝杯啤酒，好吗?
Relax. I go for a beer, yeah?

727
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:56,640
大厨们，你们还有30分钟。
Chefs, you have 30 minutes left.

728
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,120
从糖开始。是的。
Starting on sugar. Yeah.

729
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,400
我在试着拉一个糖丝带。
I'm attempting to pull a sugar ribbon.

730
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,400
我在YouTube上看到有人这么做。
I see people on YouTube doing it.

731
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,280
我参加了英国糖业锦标赛，得了第二名，
I did the UK Sugar Championships and came second,

732
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
所以，加点糖。
so, done a bit of sugar.

733
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,240
我在做我的菠萝。这必须是直的。
I am building my pineapple. This needs to be straight.

734
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
对反对派虎视眈眈
Eyeing up the opposition.

735
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,040
他们在做玫瑰。它们很棘手。
They're doing some roses. They're quite tricky.

736
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,280
这看起来很漂亮。现在，我们快赶上了。
This looks beautiful. Right now, we're getting close on time.

737
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,920
所以我要更深入地了解它。
So I'm going to have to be more de-board it.

738
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,960
我不想在大家面前这么做。
I don't want to do this in front of everybody else.

739
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:37,360
为什么?这是非常私人的事情?这是非常脆弱和困难的。
Why? It's a very private thing? It's very fragile and difficult.

740
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,120
像我这样。糖粉碎了
Like myself. SUGAR SHATTERS

741
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,360
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

742
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,240
我想把事情弄清楚。我把它压得太紧了。
I was trying to get it really straight. I've pressed it too hard.

743
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,080
它就这样……
It just sort of went...

744
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:50,240
这很好。我可以重新开始。是的，去吧。走,走。
That's fine. I can start building it again. Yeah, go for it. Go, go.

745
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,600
希望它是稳定的。
Hopefully, it's going to be stable.

746
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,400
如果你听到噼啪声，我就不高兴了。
If you hear a crack, I won't be happy.

747
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:01,720
它看起来是朝这边来的。我需要这里的水平仪，拜托。
It looks like it's coming this way. I need the spirit level in here, please.

748
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,360
这很好。它很好。别再说“没事”了!它很好。
That's fine. It's fine. Stop saying, "It's fine"! It's fine.

749
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,560
你必须要快。只会一点点。就是这样。哇，哇，哇，哇!
You have to be quick. Only a little bit. That's it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

750
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,920
迈克，你看后面，滴水。我刚注意到。
Mike, just watch at the back, the dripping. I just noticed that.

751
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,640
第二轮。我们把这个放到桌子上好吗?
Round two. Shall we move this to the table?

752
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,640
一、二、三……
One, two, three...

753
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:27,120
电梯,电梯……。不要电击，不要电击，不要电击。
Lift, lift...lift. No shock, no shock, no shock.

754
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:29,960
小心别把它弄得太乱。
Careful you don't make too much of a mess with it.

755
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,320
就是这样，就是这样。上帝保佑我们。
That's it, that's it. God help us.

756
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,000
心就像……他捶打着胸膛
Heart is like... HE THUMPS HIS CHEST

757
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
魔法。
Magic.

758
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,640
那条路?不，这边走。面朝那边。我的天啊。
That way? No, this way. Facing that way. Oh, my God.

759
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,960
哔哔声!那有一吨重。
BLEEP! That weighs a tonne.

760
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:05,040
我看不见实物。我去拿。我在走下坡路吗?
I can't see an actual thing. I'll get it. Am I going down?

761
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:08,120
对，下去。趴下，趴下，趴下!
Yeah, go down. Go down, go down, go down!

762
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:17,960
噢!五分钟，大厨们。还有五分钟。
Ooh! Five minutes, chefs. Five minutes to go.

763
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,880
哦，我现在感觉压力很大。
Oh, I feel really pressured now.

764
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,200
做壳。我得先把它造出来。
Doing the shell. I need to build it first.

765
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:27,480
我们走吧。糖凝固得太快了，我们得继续。
Let's go. The sugar is setting so quickly, we need to keep going.

766
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,000
一个小的，如果你有的话。下面有一个晃动。
One small one, if you got it. There's a wobble under there.

767
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,560
哦,哔哔声!
Oh, BLEEP!

768
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,600
这必须继续下去。这些是我们的幸运硬币。
This has to go on. These are our lucky coins.

769
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,680
我差不多做完了。
I'm pretty much almost done.

770
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,800
有人知道我们还剩多少时间吗?
Anyone know what time we've got left?

771
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,360
大厨们，你们还有一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left.

772
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,920
这种方式吗?是的。是的。
This way? Yeah. Yeah.

773
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,760
这需要继续下去。还得在上面撒点叶子。
This needs to go on. Still got to pipe some leaves on it.

774
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,160
哦，不，不，不，不!
Oh, no, no, no, no!

775
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,920
我只要把彩带粘上就行了。
I've just got to stick the ribbons on.

776
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,280
快走，快走!拿些绿色蔬菜。把绿色蔬菜拿出来。
Move it, move it! Get the greens. Get the greens going.

777
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,240
我认为它需要稍微扭转一下。
I think it needs to turn around a little bit.

778
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,920
快，快，快，快，快!
Go, go, go, go, go!

779
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,680
时间到了。
Time's up.

780
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,680
离你的展示品远点。
Step away from your showpieces.

781
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,840
让我们收拾一下，姑娘。
Let's tidy up, girl.

782
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,040
好了，我们走吧
Right, let's go

783
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,000
然后被摧毁!是啊!
and get destroyed! Yeah!

784
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,880
五个令人敬畏的展示
Five awe-inspiring showpieces

785
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,000
只用了五个小时。
made in just five hours.

786
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,800
我就是忘不了公园巷。
I just can't get over Park Lane's.

787
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,880
我都不知道他们是怎么画出这个形状的。
I don't even know how they did that shape.

788
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,000
伙计们，你们的作品非常视觉化。
Guys, you've produced something extremely visual.

789
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,800
真的很喜欢这些台词。
Really like the lines.

790
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:14,640
看你们俩的作品真是太开心了。
What a joy to watch both of your work.

791
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,000
很高兴看到你拉花的样子。
And so pleased to see the way you pull your flower.

792
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,000
我们尝尝泡芙好吗?
Shall we taste the choux?

793
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:23,240
你应该要一杯橘子利口酒配橘子果酱。
You should have an orange liqueur with a mandarin jam.

794
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,040
这泡芙很好吃。
The choux is quite pleasant to eat.

795
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,640
我真的很喜欢橘子的味道。
I really enjoy the mandarin flavour.

796
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,080
话虽如此，我们已经完全失去了橙色利口酒
Having said that, we've lost the orange liqueur altogether

797
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,960
因为你的橘子香。
because of the fragrance of your mandarin.

798
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,240
这个是开心果和覆盆子。
And this one will be pistachio and raspberry.

799
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,520
总的来说，馅料的质地还不错。
Overall, the texture of the filling is good.

800
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,760
然而，我几乎尝不出开心果的味道。
However, I hardly can taste the pistachio.

801
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,760
我完全失去了覆盆子味。
And I've lost the raspberry altogether.

802
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,880
我不喜欢这样。
I'm not enjoying this.

803
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,000
那很好。
That was good.

804
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,200
真的,各位,
Really, guys,

805
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,440
我不会想到要做那样的事
I would not have thought of doing something like that

806
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,520
在一百万英里之外。
in a million miles.

807
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:08,560
我真的很喜欢。
I really like it.

808
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:14,120
那是香草，白巧克力和覆盆子泥。
That is vanilla, white chocolate and raspberry puree.

809
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,720
很香，有覆盆子的味道。
It's fragrant, raspberry is present.

810
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,360
我很喜欢你做的蛋奶冻，因为它很滑。
I really like your custard because it's really smooth.

811
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,520
和覆盆子酱很配。
It goes so well with the raspberry jam.

812
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,120
我们来做爱尔兰利口酒……
So we do the Irish liqueur...

813
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,360
我有爱尔兰利口酒。
I've got the Irish liqueur.

814
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,400
就我个人而言，我觉得它有点太浓了。
Personally, I find it a bit too strong.

815
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,320
我喜欢它。
I love it.

816
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,840
这是个人喜好的问题。我还以为会太甜蜜了。
A matter of taste. I thought it was going to be too sweet.

817
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,840
我错了。我喜欢它的味道。
I was wrong. I love the taste.

818
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:38,960
谢谢你！谢谢你！
Thank you. Thank you.

819
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,600
我觉得你做的很漂亮。
I think it's a beautiful showpiece that you've done.

820
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,840
这是一道优雅的法式奶油布丁。
It's an elegant croque-en-bouche.

821
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,760
但你已经不仅仅是简单化了，你变得简单了。
But you've gone, not just simplistic, you've got simple.

822
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,160
我们现在有三个泡芙了。
We've got now three choux.

823
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,040
这个是……两种:抹茶。
This one is... BOTH: Matcha.

824
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
我觉得味道很好。
I think the taste is perfect.

825
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,760
然而，法式奶油，我不喜欢吃。
However, the creme patissiere, I didn't enjoy eating it.

826
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,960
有点黏。
It is a bit gummy.

827
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,840
黑醋栗。黑加仑子和栗子。
Blackcurrant. Blackcurrant and chestnut.

828
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,760
试着尝尝栗子的味道。
Trying to taste the chestnut.

829
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,520
但是，如果我不知道里面有栗子就吃了，
However, if I eat it without knowing there is chestnut in there,

830
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,920
我不会注意到的。黑芝麻。
I wouldn't notice it. Black sesame.

831
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,160
我爱吃黑芝麻。
I love my black sesame.

832
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,400
对我来说，这个，我喜欢。
For me, this, I like.

833
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,840
再多一点奶油，泡芙就完美了。
A little bit creamier, and that choux would be perfection.

834
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,240
没关系的。没关系的。他还挺喜欢的。
It's all right. It's all right. He kind of liked it.

835
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,640
我们来谈谈房间里的大象吧。
Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

836
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,120
它有点倾斜。
It's tilting slightly.

837
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,760
是的。是的。
Yeah. Yeah.

838
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:50,560
我们还得提一下，你的工作还需要改进。
We also have to mention the neatness of your work needs to improve.

839
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,160
十分钟前，你还在坚持。
It was ten minutes before, you were still sticking.

840
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,240
是的。你太匆忙了。确实很匆忙。
Yeah. You were rushing. Certainly was rushing.

841
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,800
泡芙的馅料是椰子和酸橙蛋奶冻
The filling of the choux has got a coconut and lime custard

842
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,040
然后在里面放上菠萝凝胶。
and then a pineapple gel inside.

843
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,440
泡芙面皮烤得很好。
The choux pastry is baked nicely.

844
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,920
脆皮的口感很好。
The crackling has got a nice texture.

845
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,920
对不起,珍惜。你的不是菠萝吗?
Sorry, Cherish. Is it not pineapple on yours?

846
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,440
空了!不能接受的。
Empty again! Not acceptable.

847
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,680
对不起，我不会为你的甜点买单。
Sorry, I would not pay for your dessert.

848
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:24,000
在这个底部有一点点。
There is a little bit at the bottom of this one.

849
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,000
好吧，说实话，反正也没什么味道。
Well, to be honest with you, it didn't taste much anyway.

850
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
你有吗?
You get some?

851
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,160
不。
No.

852
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,120
Ho-ho-ho-ho !
Ho-ho-ho-ho!

853
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,520
它就在那儿，雄伟，高大。
There it is, majestuous, tall.

854
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,520
它有点粗，
It's a little bit chunky,

855
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,120
而且，作为一种风格，它有点过时了。
and also, as a style, it is a little bit dated.

856
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,520
好的。看着你的茶壶，
OK. And, looking at your teapot,

857
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:02,720
我还希望你最后的点睛之笔能更细致一些。
I was hoping that you were more delicate with your finishing touch.

858
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,800
我们以下午茶为主题，
We've gone with an afternoon tea theme,

859
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:08,200
我们有一个凝块奶油泡芙包还有一个草莓凝胶。
so we have a clotted cream choux bun and there's a strawberry gel.

860
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,120
我想谈谈这个泡芙糕点。
I would like to talk about this choux pastry.

861
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,760
我觉得这太粗暴了，
I think it's very heavy-handed,

862
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,880
而且，我也没有尝到凝固的奶油。
and also, I didn't taste the clotted cream.

863
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,600
然后是伯爵茶柠檬泡芙包。
And then an Earl Grey and lemon choux bun.

864
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:24,880
伯爵格雷奶油的质地比凝块奶油好。
The texture of the Earl Grey cream is better than the clotted cream.

865
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,760
之后，味道组合就很无趣了。
After, the flavour combination was pretty uninteresting.

866
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,280
它不是很好。
It wasn't great.

867
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,600
第一次喝的时候，我说，“哦，我能尝出伯爵茶的味道，”
On the first taste, I said, "Oh, I can taste the Earl Grey,"

868
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,080
然后酸进来了
and then the acid comes in

869
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,280
我不太喜欢，所以，抱歉
and I didn't really enjoy, so, sorry,

870
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,920
我一点也不喜欢这样。好的。
I didn't like this at all. OK.

871
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,920
她抽泣
SHE SOBS

872
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,840
来了,来了。
Come, come.

873
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:45,240
来吧，别哭了。
CHERISH: Come on, don't cry.

874
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,760
太尴尬了。
That was so embarrassing.

875
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,600
有点尴尬。
Like, proper embarrassing.

876
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,240
你哭什么?我不知道。
What you crying for? I don't know.

877
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,400
根据他们在两项挑战中的表现，
Based on their performance across both challenges,

878
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:06,680
评委们将对参赛队伍进行排名，
the judges will now rank the teams,

879
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,880
最后一名的队伍
and the team in last place

880
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,520
将不得不退出比赛。
will have to leave the competition.

881
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:13,920
昨天的失望过后，
After yesterday's disappointment,

882
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,960
我们制作了我们想要的东西，达到了我们想要的水平。
we produced exactly what we wanted to, to the level we wanted to.

883
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,360
不管现在发生什么，我觉得我们已经为自己感到骄傲了。
Whatever happens now, I feel we've done ourselves proud.

884
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,880
很有趣，你不觉得吗?
Very interesting, don't you think?

885
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,360
我喜欢那里的配色。
I like the colour scheme there.

886
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:26,400
我们在比赛一开始就很低，
We started off the competition on a quite low peg,

887
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,840
但这周我们把它砸了。
but this week we smashed it, I think.

888
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,920
有点胖。
A bit chunky.

889
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,160
说到底，这些都是建设性的批评。
It's all constructive criticism, at the end of the day.

890
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:33,440
是啊，回去学习吧。
Yeah, go back and learn.

891
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,080
他们这么说不是为了冒犯你，而是为了让你进步。
They don't say it to offend you, they say it to make you improve.

892
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:37,440
听起来还是很难受。是的。
It's still hard to hear. Yeah.

893
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:44,040
伯努瓦和珍爱已经做出了决定。
Benoit and Cherish have reached their decision.

894
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,480
第一名的团队在口味和展示方面表现出色
The team in first place excelled in their flavours and presentation

895
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,320
跨越两个艰难的挑战。
across two tough challenges.

896
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:54,440
恭喜你……

你晋级下一轮了。

第二名是希尔顿公园巷的伊曼纽尔和山姆。

900
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:10,000

And Sweet Art Lab's Hideko and Theo have come third.

901
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:14,160

Which leaves Michael and Rebekah from the St David's Hotel

902
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,560
还有邦邦糕点店的玛尔塔和朱莉。
and Marta and Julie from Bom Bom Patisserie.

903
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,280
经过深思熟虑，今晚回家的队伍将是……

904
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,280
. .邦邦糕点店的玛尔塔和朱莉。
..Marta and Julie from Bom Bom Patisserie.

905
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,160
祝贺你们其他人。
Congratulations to the rest of you.

906
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,400
我们下周见。
We'll see you next week.

907
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,040
哦，我感觉有点不舒服。
Oh, I'm feeling a bit upset.

908
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:42,800
是的,很失望。
Yeah, disappointed.

909
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,640
这是你的第一次比赛，对吗?是的。
It's your first competition, right? Yes.

910
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,080
我为我们所做的一切感到骄傲。不是吗?
I'm proud of what we've done. Aren't you?

911
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,680
这让我重拾了对职业的热情。
It's given me my passion back for my trade.

912
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,720
哦，你们把它砸了。
Oh, you lot smashed it.

913
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,480
辉煌。是的,太棒了。
Brilliant. Yeah, fantastic.

914
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,560
是的，我非常非常高兴。
Yeah, really, really happy about it.

915
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,240
它让你想呆在那里。
It makes you want to stay there.

916
00:45:57,280 --> 00:45:59,280
你知道吗?这会让你更加挣扎。
You know? It makes you fight even more.

917
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,560
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

918
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:02,600
嗯，是的，很震惊。
Um, yeah, shocked.

919
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,920
我简直不敢相信!我以为我们已经走了!
I can't believe it! I thought we were gone!

920
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,520
我想我们必须努力，否则下周就回家。
I think we've got to go hard or go home next week.

921
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,720
下一次，竞争只会更加激烈……
Next time, the competition only gets tougher...

922
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,880
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,600
. .评委们设置了有史以来第一个秘密食谱挑战…
..as the judges set the first ever Secret Recipe Challenge...

924
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,120
我不知道它长什么样。
I have no idea how it looks like.

925
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,480
. .一个颓废的展示品……

00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
汤姆，你在说什么?得了吧，利亚姆。
Tom, what are you talking about? Oh, give me a break, Liam.

我只是想让观众能看懂。

就像我们说"主菜"而不是蛋糕。
You know, like when we say "entremet" instead of cake.

17

巧克力是给其他人的。

Good. Good. What about the stand? Have you done a sketch of it?

我们有一个基本的设计。它看起来像一个可爱的鸡蛋计时器。
We have kind of got a basic design. It looks like a lovely egg timer.

85
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,720
它的功能。把它倒过来。把它倒过来。
It does. Just turn it upside down. Turn it upside down.

86
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,280
如果一切都出了问题，我们就把它翻个底朝天。
If it all goes wrong, we'll turn it upside down.

87
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,480
不管他们怎么说，
Whichever way they choose to present it,

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,160
米迦勒和丽贝卡的证人席将由一列

89
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,400
三个巧克力球，将用树叶装饰。

我希望如此。
I hope so.

尽量不要过时。不要守旧。

他们必须快速工作，以便有时间让它们凝固。

大概这么高。是的…

看起来太高了。我认为它不会很快凝固。

上周的获胜者Darryl和Bharat，

现在是时候了，安全点。

你在做花吗?是的。
You making the flowers? Yeah.

134
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,680
享受。
Enjoy.

135
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
嗯。
Mmm.

136
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,040
珍爱可能会说……
Cherish will probably say...

137
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,480
“厨师，这是很好的。”
"Chef, it's well-tempered."

138
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,280
哦，我能听到噼啪声。是的。
Oh, I can hear the crack. Yup.

139
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,720
你们能行的，伙计。我们会知道的，不是吗?
You guys got this, man. We'll find out, won't we?

140
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,040
还剩两小时，大厨们，你们还有两小时。
Two hours left, chefs, you've got two hours left.

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,320
架子正在凝固，等待脱模。
The stand is setting and waiting to be unmould.

142
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,040
然后做蛋糕。
And then making the cake.

143
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,720
球队现在必须把注意力转移
The teams must now turn their attention

144
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,680
给他们的福伊尔·德·蒙
to their Feuille D'automne -

145
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,600
这是一种默默无闻的法国美食，之前没有人做过。
an obscure French delicacy none of them have made before.

146
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:20,840
酥皮蛋糕由一层蛋白霜组成
A Feuille D'automne consists of layer of meringue

147
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,200
巧克力慕斯，
and chocolate mousse,

148
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,200
最后是一块巧克力
finished with a band of chocolate

149
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
上面撒上巧克力玫瑰酱。
and topped with chocolate rosace.

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,040
但如果你从未见过，从未做过，
But if you've never seen it before, never done it before,

151
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
这将会非常非常奇怪。
it's going to be really, really strange.

152
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,960
我认为这是一个挑战。这就是他们所害怕的。
And I think this is the challenge. This is what they are afraid of.

153
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,840
没有控制的部分。
The part where no control.

154
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,440
我们有了食谱，但知道怎么做是另一回事。
We got the recipe, but knowing how to do it is a different thing.

155
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,600
我不知道它长什么样。不知道。
I have no idea how it looks like. No idea.

156
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,360
就像一层慕斯，中间夹着蛋白霜。酥皮。
Maybe like a layer of the mousse, sandwiched with meringue. Meringue.

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,040
早上好,伙计。早上好,利亚姆。你好吗？
Morning, guys. Morning, Liam. How are you?

158
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,560
还不错，最近怎么样?
Yeah, not too bad, how's it going?

159
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:55,480
现在，我开始做蛋白霜。把它放在机器里搅拌。
So at the moment, I'm starting the meringue. Whip it in the machine.

160
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
鞭子。你知道鞭子舞吗?
Whip it. Have you, do you know that dance, Whip It?

161
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,720
我们应该直呼其名吗?利亚姆笑
Should we nae-nae? LIAM LAUGHS

162
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,320
再做一次。我不会做的。
Do that again. I'm not doing it.

163
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,240
再来一次。不。我来抽一下，你这娘们，我就走。好吗?
Just one more time. No. I'll whip it, you nae-nae, and I'll go. OK?

164
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,880
好吧，我们开始吧。
OK, let's do it.

165
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,600
看着我，我的名字。
Watch me nae-nae.

166
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,680
走吧，走吧。我走了，我走了。
Go, get going. I'm gone, I'm gone.

167
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,200
好吧,再见。祝你们好运。再见!
OK, bye. Good luck, guys. Bye!

168
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,520
你在做蛋白霜吗?是的。
Are you doing the meringue? Yeah.

169
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,360
哦,对不起。我来打扫。对不起,厨师。
Oh, sorry. I'll clean it up. Sorry, Chef.

170
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,120
不，不，不。哦，对不起，对不起。
No, no, no. Oh, sorry, sorry.

171
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,760
破坏。蓄意破坏，蓄意破坏，蓄意破坏。
Sabotage. Sabotage, sabotage, sabotage.

172
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:32,240
蛋白霜是蛋糕的基石。
The meringue is the bedrock of this gateau.

173
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:35,040
团队正确烘焙是至关重要的。
It's crucial the teams bake them correctly.

174
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
很明显，如果蛋白派没有烤好，
Obviously if the meringue is not baked right,

175
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,200
它装不住慕斯。
it doesn't hold the mousse.

176
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,640
如果你烤得不够熟，蛋白霜就会太软。
If you underbake the meringue, it's going to be too soft.

177
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:43,480
如果你煮得太久，它也很容易坍塌。
If you overcook it, it could also collapse quite easily.

178
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,520
虽然大多数人选择快速烘焙…
While most are opting for a quick bake...

179
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,200
15吗?是的。
15? Yeah.

180
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,360
15分钟。十个
15 minutes. Ten.

181
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,480
. .伊曼纽尔和山姆采取了相反的方法。
..Emmanuel and Sam are taking the opposite approach.

182
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,880
那么，蛋白霜要煮多久?
So, the meringue, how long will it be cooking for?

183
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,760
普通蛋白霜很可能要在里面放40分钟。
The plain meringue would be very likely a good 40 minutes in there.

184
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,760
40分钟吗?他们希望它是硬的。
40 minutes? They want it to be firm.

185
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,640
看起来一切都在他们掌控之中。
Seems like they're in control.

186
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,640
我们会看到，我们会看到是否控制住了。
We'll see, we'll see if the control has been kept.

187
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,120
完全正确。
Exactly.

188
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,400
烤好了，我试着做慕斯，巧克力。
So that bakes, and I try to make mousse, chocolate.

189
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,080
和酥皮。
And meringue.

190
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,880
折叠蛋白霜。
Folding in the meringue.

191
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,840
我觉得他们想要那种轻盈的慕斯。
I think they're looking for that light, airy mousse.

192
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,400
为了保持摩丝的轻盈，
To retain the lightness of their mousse,

193
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,840
通过轻轻折叠来保持空气的流通是很重要的。
it's essential they keep the air in by folding it gently.

194
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,680
我不确定它应该是这样的，但是……今天是猜字日。
I'm not sure it should look like that, but...today is guess day.

195
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:37,440
太粗糙，就有可能把它变成液体。
Too rough, and they risk reducing it to a liquid.

196
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,160
那是你的摩丝吗?是的。
Is that some of your mousse there? Yes.

197
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,520
这样可以吗?
Is it all right?

198
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,280
非常愉快的。这几乎和天使乐一样好吃。
Very pleasant. This is almost as good as Angel Delight.

199
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,560
大厨们，你们已经完成一半了。
Chefs, you are halfway through.

200
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:07,040
迈克，我很高兴。我们需要继续努力。
Mike, I'm happy. We need to crack on.

201
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,760
山姆，看这个。他们需要更多。
Sam, look at this. They need a bit more.

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,600
有点耗时，但是……
It's a bit time consuming, but...

203
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:17,560
对于那些已经烤好的蛋白派，可以开始制作了。
For those with meringues baked, the build can begin.

204
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,920
我们可以开始分层了。现在是推动的时候了。
We can start layering. And now is the time to push.

205
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,400
你必须非常快。
You have to be pretty quick.

206
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,920
一旦完成，他们的大门就会被关闭。
Once complete, their gateaus are put to rest.

207
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,920
我们看到了什么?
What do we see?

208
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:35,320
但伊曼纽尔和萨姆落后了。
But Emmanuel and Sam have fallen behind.

209
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

210
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,600
蛋白霜煮过头了。
The meringue is overcooked.

211
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,520
对不起,山姆。我要把巧克力轻轻地放在上面。
Sorry, Sam. I'm going to place chocolate on the top gently.

212
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,640
比如，把它放在一起。
Like, to hold it together.

213
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,320
现在重做蛋白霜已经太晚了。
It's too late to remake a meringue.

214
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,440
在压力下。
Under pressure.

215
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,000
压力太大了。
Definitely under pressure.

216
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,360
你想让我再做一次蛋白霜吗?
You want me to make the meringue again?

217
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,400
好吧，试试吧。你有原料。
OK, go for it. You've got the ingredients.

218
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
大厨们，你们还有一个小时。
Chefs, you've got an hour left.

219
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,520
是的。会非常非常紧。
Yes. It'll be very, very tight.

220
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,320
当伊曼纽尔和山姆重新开始时，
As Emmanuel and Sam start again,

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,880
其他队用他们的看台继续前进。
the other teams push on with their stands.

222
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,480
哦,哔哔声。
Oh, BLEEP.

223
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,920
开始专注于装饰，展台
Start focusing on the decoration, the stand -

224
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,240
这需要尽快完成。
it needs to be done as soon as possible.

225
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,400
酷豆。
Cool beans.

226
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,520
别再说了。
Don't say that again.

227
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,720
很显然说凉豆并不酷。
Apparently it's not cool to say cool beans.

228
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,240
你又不是14岁了。
You're not 14 years old.

229
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,200
上周，第一名。
Last week, first place.

230
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,000
比如，自信程度很高?
Like, confidence levels, high?

231
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,640
这是我从来没做过的事，很挣扎。
Well, it's something I've never really done, so struggling.

232
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,360
祝你们好运。
Good luck, guys.

233
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,600
当然是在压力之下。
Under pressure, of course.

234
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,240
蛋白霜是整个甜点的主要部分。
Meringue is a major part of the whole dessert.

235
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:16,800
事情就是这样。这并不理想。
It is what it is. Which isn't ideal.

236
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,160
蛋白派对你有影响吗?有一点，是的。这很烦人，
Has the meringue got to you? A bit, yeah. It's annoying that,

237
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,840
你知道，这已经发生了。你认为你能按时完成吗?
you know, this has happened. Do you reckon you'll finish on time?

238
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,640
我是说，你的蛋白派在里面。
I mean, your meringues are in there.

239
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,480
蛋白派要做多久?37分钟。
How long does meringues take to cook? 37 minutes.

240
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,680
哦……
Oh...

241
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,160
大厨们，你们还有半小时。
Chefs, you have half an hour left.

242
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,600
半小时，大厨们。
Half an hour, chefs.

243
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,000
他们要担心的并不是大门。
Their gateaus aren't all they have to worry about.

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,280
现在，他们的展台设计将面临考验。
Now the designs for their stands will be put to the test.

245
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,560
英子和西奥，你们感觉怎么样?
Hideko and Theo, how are you feeling?

246
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,360
有点赶时间。感觉紧张吗?
A bit in a rush. Feeling stressed?

247
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,320
是的。大问题。稳定。
Yeah. Big problem. Stability.

248
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,240
建设本身也有挑战。
Construction comes with its own challenges.

249
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,640
如果它们碰巧掉了……我希望不会。你知道的…
If they happen to drop... I hope it doesn't. You know...

250
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,200
显然我们不希望它下降。它不会下降。
Obviously we don't want it to drop. It's not going to drop.

251
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,880
是的,是的。除非你搞砸了。
Yeah, yeah. Unless you jinx it.

252
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:12,880
它们拥有的组件越多，需要进行的连接就越多。
The more components they have, the more joins to make.

253
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,720
像树叶一样颤抖。
Literally shaking like a leaf.

254
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,320
整个宇宙崩溃的可能性越大…
And the more chances the whole thing could collapse...

255
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,440
希望稳定。
Hopefully stable.

256
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,040
不自信。
Not confident.

257
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,000
. .把蛋糕也带上。
..bringing the gateau with it.

258
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,640
叹了口气
SIGHS

259
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,040
哔哔声!是压力，压力让我受不了。
BLEEP! It's the pressure - the pressure is getting to me.

260
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:31,480
蛋白霜，要做好了。
The meringue - need to get it done.

261
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,680
等等，它要断了。
Wait, it's going to break.

262
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,120
那你们俩就有机会赚钱了。
You totes got a money shot then.

263
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,200
底部钻头断了。哔哔声。
The bottom bit broke off. BLEEP.

264
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,600
迈克尔。我很害怕。
Michael. I'm scared.

265
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:48,560
我们只是在等蛋白派。
We're just actually waiting for that meringue.

266
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,720
它会向右转。蛋白霜会很好吃的。
It will go right. That meringue is going to be right.

267
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,640
它必须是。
It has to be.

268
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,080
这是坏的。
This is broken.

269
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,480
我要把它藏起来。
I'm going to hide it.

270
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,680
它很乱。
It's very messy.

271
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,080
大厨们，你们还有15分钟，15分钟。
Chefs, you have 15 minutes remaining, 15 minutes.

272
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,600
荒谬。
Ridiculous.

273
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,000
你还好吗?
You OK?

274
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,560
是的。我不知道……
Yeah. I don't know...

275
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
稳定……
Stability...

276
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,200
哦，那真是过时了。
Oh, that's really gone out.

277
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,800
我不喜欢它。我们有点太静了。
I don't like it. We've gone a bit too static.

278
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,560
似乎没什么问题。
Seems to be all right.

279
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,000
显然，上次看起来还不错，所以……
Obviously, before, it looked all right last time, so...

280
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,120
. .我想十分钟后我们就会知道了。
..we'll find out in about ten minutes, I suppose.

281
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,880
大厨们，你们还有十分钟做杂烩……
Chefs, you have ten minutes left for your Feuille D'...

282
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,760
秋天的蛋糕要完成了。
Autumn cakes to be finished.

283
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,200
需要冷静一下。所以我在做蛋糕的装饰。
Needs to cool down. So I'm working on the decoration for the cake.

284
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,840
压力太大了。
Definitely under pressure.

285
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,680
四人份的玫瑰和巧克力蛋糕，收尾。
Rosace and chocolate band for four, for finishing.

286
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,960
所以乐队还不错。我相信这只是个简单的乐队。
So the band is not too bad. I'm sure it's just a simple band.

287
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,840
是的,很好。
Yeah, good.

288
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,280
这只是我们要努力解决的问题。
It's just the rosace which we're going to struggle with.

289
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,800
玫瑰是用精致的褶边做成的
The rosace is made of delicate ruffles

290
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,800
这是很难掌握的。
that are difficult to master.

291
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,560
走，走，走，走，走。如果团队不能快速行动……
Go, go, go, go, go. If the teams don't work fast...

292
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
哔哔声!. .巧克力会凝固的。
BLEEP! ..the chocolate will set.

293
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,400
玫瑰酱不怎么管用。
The rosace doesn't really work.

294
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,040
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

295
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,000
它说要快点。
It said do quickly.

296
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,680
哦,上帝。哔哔声!
Oh, God. BLEEP!

297
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,360
至少想弄点东西在上面。
Trying to get at least something to put on top.

298
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,280
所以所有这些巧克力都是……
So all these chocolates squigglies, from...

299
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,840
不要吃它们，我们需要它们。
Don't eat them, we need them.

300
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,120
你正要把它放进嘴里，是吗?
You were just about to put that in your mouth, weren't you?

301
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,800
别用手指摸巧克力。
Don't you finger the chocolate.

302
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,240
看起来不错。
That looks good.

303
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,320
现在最重要的是继续努力，把事情做好。
It's just now about cracking on and getting things done.

304
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,680
大厨们，你们还有一分钟，就一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left, just one minute.

305
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,160
来吧，宝贝。
Come on, baby.

306
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,960
如此脆弱。
So fragile.

307
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,680
基本上，我们必须从无到有。
We've got to make something out of nothing, basically.

308
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,920
我只有一次机会。
I got one chance.

309
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,840
我们不是墨守成规者。
We're not conformists.

310
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,080
我不确定它应该是这个样子，
I'm not sure it should look like that,

311
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,360
但我得给他们点什么
but I have to give them something.

312
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,760
大厨们，你们的时间到了。
Chefs, your time is up.

313
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,320
你的秘方挑战结束了。
Your Secret Recipe Challenge is over.

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,360
它代表……差不多。
It stands...just about.

315
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,760
四个福伊尔·德·秋曼
Four Feuille D'automne

316
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,480
还有四个精致的摊位，在三个半小时内设计完成。
and four exquisite stands, designed and built in three and a half hours.

317
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,640
伯努瓦和珍爱等着他们。
Benoit and Cherish await them.

318
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,000
我真的很喜欢你的立场。
I really like the way you interplay your stand.

319
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:40,560
你抬高高度，和其他选手相比，
You lift up the height, and compared to the rest of the contestants,

320
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,160
你在这方面很突出。
you stand out, for this.

321
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
谢谢你！
Thank you.

322
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,400
然而，我们可以看到你有一点挣扎
However, we can see that you struggled a little bit

323
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,560
有褶边的。
with the ruffle.

324
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:50,880
这不是我们要找的。
It's not what we're looking for.

325
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,400
对，就像木屑或木屑。
Yeah, it is like wood shavings or wood chips.

326
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,960
秋天了，秋天了。
It's autumn, autumn.

327
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,520
是的，现在是秋天，没错。
Yeah, it's autumn, all right, yeah.

328
00:17:56,560 --> 00:18:00,480
希望它尝起来比看起来好一点。
Hopefully it will taste a little bit better than it looks.

329
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,840
这可不是什么好消息。
Well, it's not great news.

330
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,760
这不是巧克力慕斯。
It's not a chocolate mousse.

331
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:18,200
它更像是一种黏黏的，甘纳糖的，甜的东西。
It's closer to a kind of a sticky, ganachey, sweet thing.

332
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:21,760
我们的蛋白霜没煮熟。如你所见，它很软。
Our meringue is undercooked. As you can see, it is soft.

333
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
我不喜欢吃这个。
I didn't enjoy eating this.

334
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,000
对我来说很黏。
It's very slimy for me.

335
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:26,040
对不起。
Sorry.

336
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:35,840
从远处看，这是一个非常昂贵和高级的蛋糕。
From far, it's a very expensive and premium cake.

337
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,080
那是很远的地方。那就呆在那儿吧!
That's from far. Stay over there, then!

338
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,320
笑声
LAUGHTER

339
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,960
回来!
Get back!

340
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,000
她声称
SHE EXCLAIMS

341
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,400
当我走近看蛋糕时，
When I walk closer to look at the cake,

342
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:51,440
我只能看到两个圆盘，三个球，这很安全。
all I can see is just two disks, three balls - it's very safe.

343
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:56,320
这并不像真正的玫瑰那样优雅，但它们就在那里，
This is not as elegant as a proper rosace, but they are there,

344
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
有很多这样的人。
there are plenty of them.

345
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,720
蛋白霜烤得不够好，但至少酥脆了，
That meringue is not baked enough, but at least you've got crispiness,

346
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,240
这样我就可以吃了
so I can eat that.

347
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,480
巧克力慕斯太浓了，太黏了。
Chocolate mousse is so dense, is so gummy.

348
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:15,600
吃这片蛋糕真不舒服。
It's not enjoyable eating this slice of cake.

349
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:32,200
我将从证人席开始。
I will start with the stand.

350
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,520
底料给人一种时髦的感觉。花,
The base gives a nice little funky effect. The flower,

351
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,000
技术很棒，做得很好。
the technique is great, so well done.

352
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,160
这条褶边看起来很吸引人。
The ruffle looks quite appealing.

353
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,320
就这点而言，我认为你做得很好。
For that, I think you did very well.

354
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,360
巧克力慕斯很好吃。
The chocolate mousse is pleasant.

355
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,160
我喜欢吃你的蛋白霜。
I enjoyed eating your meringue.

356
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
烤得也很好。你控制好了自己的时间
Well-baked as well. You managed to control your time enough to be able

357
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,000
重新振作，犯错误，然后改正错误。
to bounce back and make a mistake and fix your mistake.

358
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,840
非常感谢。谢谢你！
Thank you very much. Thank you.

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,120
你给我们做了蛋糕。
You managed to serve us the gateau.

360
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,640
好吧，我想积极的一面，我只能说这么多了。
Well, I think for positive sides, that's about all that I can say.

361
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,760
是的。首先，我认为这个展位很有条理。
Yeah. First of all, the stand I think is very structured.

362
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,280
我还以为你们俩能有更多收获呢。
I was hoping for more from both of you.

363
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,040
嗯嗯。褶边，你少了一点，不够。
Mm-hm. The ruffle, you came up a bit short, there's not enough.

364
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,360
但至少要多做这些，并试着做一束花。没有完成。
But at least do plenty of this, and try to make a bouquet. Not finished.

365
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,600
再加一点巧克力慕斯盖在蛋白霜上
And a little bit of chocolate mousse to cap that meringue

366
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,320
是制作一份美味的羊腿菜的一部分。
is part of what makes a nice Feuille D'automne.

367
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,320
巧克力慕斯很重。
Chocolate mousse is quite heavy.

368
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:03,600
蛋白霜是生的，抱歉，我不能吃这个。
The meringue is uncooked, so, sorry, can't eat this.

369
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,520
蛋白派，来吧。这是我们的生意，这是我们的工作。
Meringues - come on. This is our trade, this is what we do.

370
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:10,800
我们做蛋白酥皮。不适合我，谢谢。
We do meringues. Not working for me, thank you.

371
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:11,880
好的。谢谢你！
OK. Thank you.

372
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,160
没有问题。
No problem.

373
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,440
天啊，来这个节目真是个坏主意。
Oh, God, this was a bad idea, to come on this show.

374
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,720
这是谁的主意?你的。
Whose idea was it? Yours.

375
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:26,040
是的，我们有点失望，因为，你知道，再一次，
Yeah, we feel disappointed, a bit, because, you know, again,

376
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,280
就像我们说的，我们是专业人士，所以…
like we say, we're professionals, so...

377
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,640
我们想成为专业人士。
Well, we're trying to be professionals.

378
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,200
我很擅长钓鱼，所以我可能会去钓鱼。
I'm really good at fishing, so I might take that up.

379
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,880
Showpiece是它的重要组成部分，它可以改变游戏规则。
The Showpiece is such a big part of it that that can be a game-changer.

380
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,760
你今天可以过得很糟糕，做一场精彩的表演，
You can have a rubbish day today, do an amazing Showpiece,

381
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,800
你是第一名。
and you're number one.

382
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,080
完全用巧克力制作一个展览品需要很多人
Constructing a Showpiece entirely from chocolate will require so many

383
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,880
这些元素让各支队伍有了“黄金时间”去锤炼
elements that the teams have been given a "golden hour" to temper and

384
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,680
准备好任何需要过夜的东西。
prepare anything that needs to set overnight.

385
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,080
你觉得谁最危险?
Who do you sense is most in danger?

386
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,280
我们甜蜜艺术实验室的朋友们真的会思考
Well, our friends from the Sweet Art Lab can actually think

387
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,680
不墨守成规，但如果要传递经典，
outside the box, but when it's about delivering the classics,

388
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,440
他们似乎有点挣扎。
they seem to struggle a little.

389
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,680
至于我，我很担心圣大卫酒店。
As for me, I'm worried about St David's Hotel.

390
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,520
在视觉方面，我对他们今天的作品感到非常失望。
Visual-wise, I was very disappointed with what they produced today.

391
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,120
名胜世界上周表现非常出色。
Resorts World did so well last week.

392
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,360
但很明显他们在挣扎。
But obviously they struggle.

393
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
如果他们想在这场比赛中继续前进，
If they want to go forward in this competition,

394
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,000
他们当然必须提高自己的水平。
they will certainly have to raise their game.

395
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:24,720
所以，最吸引人的门道之一就是希尔顿公园巷。
So, one of the most attractive gateaux was Hilton Park Lane.

396
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,400
他们做得很好。
They did quite well.

397
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,360
但是，你知道，我们看到了其他球队的反弹。
But, you know, we've seen the other teams bounce back.

398
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,440
一切都是为了游戏。好戏上演。
Everything is to play for. It's showtime.

399
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,400
小羊咩咩叫
LAMBS BLEAT

400
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,080
早上好，厨师们。
Good morning, chefs.

401
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,840
我们希望你们都从昨天的秘方挑战中恢复过来了。
We hope you all have recovered from yesterday's Secret Recipe Challenge.

402
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,680
评委们，请告诉我们你们选出的作品。
Judges, please tell us what you've chosen for today's Showpiece.

403
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,560
好了，厨师们，今天我们希望你们围绕这个主题做一个展示
Well, chefs, today we would like you to make a Showpiece around the theme

404
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,760
化装舞会的。"
of "masked ball."

405
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,760
你的作品必须包括两种不同的类型
Your Showpiece must include two different types

406
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:16,240
模制和填充的巧克力，总共八份。
of moulded and filled chocolate, for eight in total.

407
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:20,480
您的展品必须至少有一个活动部件。
Your Showpiece must have at least one moving part.

408
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,560
移动的部分会是某人的脸吗，
Can the moving part be someone's face,

409
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,600
当他们把它塞进嘴里的时候?
as they're stuffing it in their gobs?

410
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,200
绝对不是。
Absolutely not.

411
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,520
厨师们，你们昨晚只有一个小时的准备时间，
Chefs, you had one golden hour last night to prepare,

412
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,880
你还有四个小时来完成今天的挑战。
and you have four more hours to complete today's challenge.

413
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,960
你的时间从现在开始。
Your time starts now.

414
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,800
正确的。
Right.

415
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,280
显然有很多事要做，
Obviously a lot to do,

416
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,920
但如果我们继续努力，就会没事的。
but if we push on we should be fine.

417
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:46,360
你想要这个?是的。谢谢你！
You want this? Yeah. Thank you.

418
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,360
现在我只需要做面具了。
So now I've just got to do the mask.

419
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,920
我只是在上面涂了点巧克力。
I'm just coating it with a bit of chocolate.

420
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,240
自16世纪以来，假面舞会占据了
Since the 16th century, masked balls have occupied

421
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,440
国王和王后日历上的圣地
a hallowed place on the calendars of kings, queens

422
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,320
和整个欧洲的贵族
and nobility across Europe.

423
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,600
假面舞会就像一个优雅、顽皮的聚会。
A masked ball is like an elegant, naughty party.

424
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,120
我想去参加化装舞会。
I'd like to go to a masked ball.

425
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,120
听起来很有趣。
It sounds quite fun.

426
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,680
我不喜欢打扮。
I don't like dressing up.

427
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,520
说句公道话，我不喜欢派对。
I'm not a fan of parties, to be fair.

428
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,200
是的,对的。
Yeah, right.

429
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:16,120
参赛队伍必须将所有的魅力和成熟融入
The teams must channel all that glamour and sophistication into

430
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:20,600
完美的巧克力展示了这些壮观的事件。
immaculate chocolate Showpieces that evoke these spectacular events.

431
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,720
面具需要有超乎想象的细节。
The mask needs to have details beyond imaginations.

432
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,200
我们想看到很多奢侈的东西。
We want to see a lot of extravagance.

433
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,520
我们想玩得开心。
We want to have fun.

434
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,080
我们想看到运动，我们想看到音乐。
We want to see movement, we want to see music.

435
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,360
我希望厨师有创造力和创新精神。
I want the chef to be creative and innovative.

436
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,720
我想看到闪闪发光，香槟酒冒出来。
I want to see glitter, champagne popping up.

437
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,200
带我去舞会。
Take me to the ball.

438
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:43,280
除了他们的表演作品，他们还必须制作48个完美的糖果
Along with their Showpieces, they must produce 48 flawless bonbons

439
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:46,600
他们的颓废不亚于政党本身。
that are no less decadent than the parties themselves.

440
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:49,320
我们已经试过了。我认为它们是有效的。
We've tried and tested the favours. I think they work.

441
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,080
很明显，法官们可能会有不同的意见。
Obviously the judges might have a different opinion.

442
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:57,040
巧克力软糖就是要确保这些小形状
Chocolate bonbon is all about making sure those little shapes

443
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,720
都铸得很完美。
are cast perfectly.

444
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,640
它们需要在我的味蕾上探戈，给我一点
They need to tango on my palate and give me a bit of

445
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,360
cha-cha-cha。
cha-cha-cha.

446
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,920
你有香槟淋浴。
You have some champagne shower.

447
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,280
#戏剧!＃
# Drama! #

448
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,880
谁来摇一摇。
Someone shake it all.

449
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,000
对不起,Hideko。没关系。
Sorry, Hideko. It's OK.

450
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,600
所有的团队都花了他们的黄金时间来挑选元素
All the teams spent their golden hour casting elements

451
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,040
为了他们的展览。
for their Showpiece.

452
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,120
现在我们要看看结果如何。
Now we need to see how it's coming out.

453
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,280
总是很有挑战性的时刻。
Always quite a challenging moment.

454
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,960
需要帮忙吗，Hideko?不，没关系。
Need a hand, Hideko? No, it's OK.

455
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,800
对Hideko来说，现在是关键时刻。
And for Hideko, now is the moment of truth.

456
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,440
这就是我。
This is me.

457
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,480
这是一个酒窝。
This is a dimple.

458
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,480
早上好,伙计。早上好。早....
Morning, guys. Good morning. Morning.

459
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,840
你能多告诉我们一些关于Showpiece的事吗
Would you be able to tell us a bit more about that Showpiece

460
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,280
你今天在为我们创作吗?是的。
you are creating for us today? Yes.

461
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
所以，它会像一个舞厅。
So, it's going to be like a ballroom.

462
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,560
这些楼梯在展厅后面，
These stairs going behind the Showpiece,

463
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,640
而英子将站在最上面。
and it's going to be Hideko's on the top.

464
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,800
她一夜之间把自己的脸打了个精光。
She cast her own face overnight.

465
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:56,600
一张漂亮的脸。
A beautiful face.

466
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,360
运动的部分是什么?扇在脸上，
So what's the moving part going to be? Fans on top of the face,

467
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,280
就像一个粉丝。是的。
so like a fan. Yes.

468
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,080
当它……就像一种感觉。我在电影里见过。
When it... Like a feeling. I've seen it in films.

469
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:09,800
舞厅里有两种糖果
Inside the ballroom will be two types of bonbons -

470
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,600
白巧克力，里面有草莓玫瑰凝胶
a white chocolate, filled with strawberry rose gel

471
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
还有香槟甘纳许，
and champagne ganache,

472
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,680
还有一块金色斑点的黑巧克力
and a gold-flecked dark chocolate

473
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,720
里面有柚子胶和清酒甘纳许。
filled with yuzu gel and sake ganache.

474
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,240
我们现在可以尝尝清酒吗?
Can we taste some sake now?

475
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,240
当然，如果你愿意的话。
Yes, of course, if you want to.

476
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,880
这是用大米做的，对吗?
It's made from rice, is it?

477
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,560
发酵的大米。
Fermented rice.

478
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,240
毫米。
Mm.

479
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,840
哦!
Oh!

480
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,080
我的胸毛还不够长。
I don't have enough hairs on my chest for that.

481
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,200
哦，别这样，这是……
Oh, come on - it's...

482
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:39,080
Darryl和Bharat也在喝酒。
Darryl and Bharat are also hitting the bottle.

483
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,160
这是展览的主体结构。
This is the main structure for the Showpiece.

484
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,160
它是香槟酒瓶的形状。
It's the shape of a champagne bottle.

485
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,640
我们将有一个旋转面具和一些羽毛出来。
We're going to have a rotating mask and some feathers coming out.

486
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:51,440
在他们旋转的面具下面坐着24个白斑
Below their rotating mask will sit 24 white-flecked

487
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,960
黑巧克力软糖
dark chocolate bonbons

488
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,720
里面有甜焦糖和百香果凝胶。
filled with a sweet caramel and passion fruit gel.

489
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,520
旁边放着24块白巧克力，
Alongside will sit 24 white chocolates,

490
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,240
分层的白巧克力甘纳许和香槟凝胶。
layered with white chocolate ganache and champagne gel.

491
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,920
你还有什么要做的吗，要把香槟的主意带来吗?
Are you doing anything else, to kind of bring the champagne idea?

492
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,520
因为香槟，当它被转化成
Because champagne, when it's actually being transformed into

493
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,400
一种凝胶，它尝起来更像葡萄酒，而不是香槟的味道。
a gel, it tastes more like wine as opposed to the champagne element.

494
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,520
是的，我们已经试着提高了。
Yes, we've tried to boost it.

495
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:19,800
与什么?加些柠檬酸来恢复味道
With what? With some citric acid to bring back the flavour

496
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,960
香槟，因为其他的都很平淡，是的。
of the champagne, because otherwise it is quite flat, yeah.

497
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,240
这让我开始跳探戈了。
This just makes me starting to tango.

498
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:32,080
每个Showpiece都需要一个基地，团队可以制作基地
Every Showpiece needs a base, and the teams can make them

499
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
可达一米宽。
up to a metre wide.

500
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,440
伊曼纽尔和山姆正在用全宽度把面具拿回来
And Emmanuel and Sam are using the full width to take the mask back

501
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,840
回到它的精神家园。
to its spiritual home.

502
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,960
我们在做一个威尼斯主题的展览。
We're doing a sort of Venice-themed Showpiece.

503
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,120
我们以水为基础，所以我们想，
We've got a water as our base, so we thought,

504
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:50,160
为什么不把我们的糖果和水混在一起呢?
why not incorporate one of our bonbons with the water?

505
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,240
所以我们得到了一种波浪效应。
So we've gone for a sort of waved effect.

506
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:55,240
他们的波浪效应糖果将是分层的
Their waved-effect bonbons will be layered

507
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:58,920
配上白巧克力、甘草甘纳许和樱桃凝胶。
with white chocolate liquorice ganache, and cherry gel.

508
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,960
他们还会提供24块黑巧克力糖果
They will also serve 24 dark chocolate bonbons

509
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,680
里面有焦糖和血橙凝胶。
filled with caramel and blood orange gel.

510
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,960
威尼斯有最漂亮、最优雅、最令人印象深刻的面具
Venice have got the most beautiful, elegant and impressive masks

511
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,640
在这个世界上。
in the world.

512
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:17,680
现在，如果你选择威尼斯这个主题，面具就必须成功。
Now, if you went for this theme of Venice, the mask needs to make it.

513
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,880
你能带我去吗?我会的。明天我们就走。
Will you take me there? I would. Tomorrow we go.

514
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,240
我可以不来吗?你可以。
Can I not come? You can.

515
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,760
你可以。你会跳一整天的舞。
You can. You will be dancing all day long.

516
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,320
每队的展示作品必须包含一个活动部件。
Each team's Showpiece must incorporate a moving part.

517
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:33,360
这是中间那个带着面具的动作。
That's for the movement in the middle, with the mask.

518
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:38,720
我让扇子一直在动，就像羽毛一样，在动。
I'm making the fan moving, always, like a feather, moving.

519
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:42,280
虽然大多数人选择电池驱动的运动…
While most are opting for battery-operated motion...

520
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,760
我们还带了一个玩具坦克。
We've actually brought a toy tank.

521
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,800
我们把船放在上面，它会绕着水转。
We'll have the boat on it, and it's going to go around the water.

522
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:53,120
迈克尔和丽贝卡的设计就没那么有活力了。
Michael and Rebekah's design is a little less dynamic.

523
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,400
我们去找准备参加舞会的人，
We've gone for somebody getting ready to go to a ball,

524
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,440
我们做了一个梳妆台。
so we've done a vanity table.

525
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,800
梳妆台前面的抽屉，
The drawer that's in the front of the dressing table,

526
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,880
你可以拔出来，所以严格来说我们有活动部件。
you'll be able to pull out, so technically we have moving parts.

527
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,400
技术上。
Technically.

528
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,480
他们的梳妆台里放着白巧克力糖果
Inside their vanity table will be white chocolate bonbons

529
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:14,000
铺上草莓泥和香槟凝胶，
lined with strawberry puree and champagne gel,

530
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,880
黑巧克力夹心糖上撒着百香果，
and dark chocolate bonbons layered with passion fruit,

531
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:18,320
蜂蜜和白巧克力。
honey and white chocolate.

532
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,640
嗨,丽贝卡。嗨,迈克尔。
Hi, Rebekah. Hi, Michael.

533
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,640
你好。你好。迈克尔，我听说你有另一个自我
Hello. Hello. Now, Michael, I heard a rumour you have an alter ego -

534
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,080
对吗?是的，我曾经有另一个自我。
is that correct? I used to have an alter ego, yeah.

535
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,960
几年前，我曾经是一名变装演员。
Years ago now, I used to be a drag performer.

536
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,720
真的吗?
Really?

537
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,280
她的名字叫蒂蒂·麦克维蒂。
Her name was Titty McVitie.

538
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:35,000
她选了什么样的衣服?
What sort of outfits did she go for?

539
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:37,000
任何适合她的衣服。她是个大女孩了。
Any ones that would fit her. She's a big girl.

540
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,160
大厨们，你们有一个小时的时间。
Chefs, you've had one hour.

541
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,600
离化装舞会还有三个小时。
You have three hours left until the masked ball.

542
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,960
我希望我能走，我就不用一直呆在这里打扫了。
I hope I get to go, I don't have to stay here sweeping up all the time.

543
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,800
我的仙女教母来了。
My fairy godmother's here.

544
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
上帝!
God!

545
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,800
我要开始吃糖果了。
I'm starting on the bonbons.

546
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,320
糖果虽然很小，
A bonbon, while small in size,

547
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:13,680
由许多元素组成，赋予它独特的高端吸引力。
is comprised of many elements that give it a distinct high-end appeal.

548
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,920
首先是美丽的外观。
And first on the list is a beautiful exterior.

549
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,160
手持螺丝刀。
Hand-held screwdriver.

550
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,960
他模仿电动工具
HE IMITATES POWER TOOL

551
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,240
我要用它来做一个漩涡的效果。
I'm going to use it to make a swirly effect.

552
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,000
这让它的动作非常快，这样你就能得到清晰的线条。
It gives it a really fast motion, and that's when you get clean lines.

553
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,600
你不能用手指这样做。
You can't do that with your finger.

554
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,000
我们确实喜欢小玩意。
We do like a gadget.

555
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,680
接下来是精细铸造的外壳。
Next, a finely cast outer shell.

556
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,960
它很脆弱。
It's very flimsy.

557
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,680
结构巧克力工程师。
Structural chocolate engineers.

558
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,040
现在我要把凝胶和甘纳许填满。
I'm now going to fill the gel and the ganache.

559
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,720
在每一个环节，饮食体验都是最重要的，
At every turn, the eating experience is paramount,

560
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:49,520
每一点都和造型一样重要。
and every bit as important as the look.

561
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,920
你觉得我应该把香槟放在底部还是顶部?
Do you think I should put champagne on the bottom, or at the top?

562
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,400
上面是软凝胶，然后是甘纳许。
Top, so when they bite it's the soft gel, then ganache.

563
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,640
每一层都需要技巧和技巧。
Each layer requires skill and finesse.

564
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,480
我正在给巧克力盖上盖子，把它摊开
I'm just capping the chocolates now, spreading it out

565
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,080
用调色刀。我喜欢尽可能快地走。
with a palette knife. I like to go as fast as we can.

566
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,160
速度是最重要的。
Speed is of the essence.

567
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:09,560
动作太慢，巧克力会凝固。
Move too slowly and the chocolate will set...

568
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,120
这可不太好。
This is not good.

569
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,280
. .留下一个不整洁不精确的糖果。
..leaving an untidy and imprecise bonbon.

570
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,320
不正常!
WHACK!

571
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:19,440
我发现巧克力有问题。略厚。
I found a problem on the chocolate. Slightly thick.

572
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,720
有点打破了……
Kind of break that...

573
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,080
困难并没有就此结束。
And the difficulties don't end there.

574
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,920
随着糖果的摆放，注意力转移到他们的展示品上。
With bonbons setting, attention switches to their Showpieces.

575
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,320
很多人在看。
Lots of people watching.

576
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,960
但山姆的超宽水基…
But Sam's extra-wide watery base...

577
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
把哔哔声板贴在那里不是个好主意。
It was a bad idea to stick that BLEEP board on there.

578
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:40,360
. .可能已经被扔进下水道了。
..may have already gone down the plughole.

579
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,000
我就知道我们不该这么做。
I knew we shouldn't have done it.

580
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,960
大厨们，你们还有一个小时。
Chefs, you have one hour left.

581
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,000
那是一个小时。
That's one hour.

582
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,840
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

583
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,160
这个开了吗?
Is this on?

584
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,920
时间不多了。
Time is starting to run out.

585
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,560
我们得埋头干我们该干的事。
We need to get our heads down and just get on with what we need to do.

586
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,200
我必须组装。
I have to assemble.

587
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,600
当大多数团队开始将他们的展示作品变为现实时，
While most of the teams start to bring their showpieces to life,

588
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,800
对山姆和伊曼纽尔来说，
for Sam and Emmanuel,

589
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:21,840
他们的威尼斯梦破灭了。
a shattered base has left their Venice dream high and dry.

590
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,320
这将是一个有趣的谜题。
It's going to be a fun puzzle.

591
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:29,080
我现在得好好玩拼图了。
I'm going to need to be good at jigsaws right now.

592
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,080
这是一个让我非常兴奋的挑战。
This is one of the challenges that I am so excited with.

593
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,120
面具和舞会。
Masks and ball.

594
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,640
Hideko用自己的脸做了面具。
The Hideko has actually used their own face for that mask.

595
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:42,040
我希望她给它上色，让它变得华丽而有趣。
I hope she colours it and she makes it quite flamboyant and fun as well.

596
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,760
达里尔和巴拉特。
Daryl and Bharat.

597
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:48,160
他们将自己的主体结构描述为香槟酒瓶。
They describe their main structure as a champagne bottle.

598
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,400
它更接近一瓶水，你说呢?
It's closer to a bottle of water, wouldn't you say?

599
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:55,280
但是，嘿，这可能是可行的。
But, hey, it may work with the scheme of things.

600
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:58,720
丽贝卡和迈克尔，你觉得他们怎么样?
Rebekah and Michael, what you think of them?

601
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:01,640
视情况而定。有时候，细节决定成败。
It depends. The devil, sometimes, is in the details.

602
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,560
是的。问题是，
Yes. The question with them,

603
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,600
他们的展示会上有足够的细节吗?
will there be enough details on their showpiece?

604
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,120
我们的团队来自希尔顿公园巷。
And we've got our team from The Hilton Park Lane.

605
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,200
显然，他们有一点压力。
Obviously, they are a little bit under pressure.

606
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,840
他们必须加快速度，加快速度，继续前进，继续前进，更快。
They have to rapido, rapido and move on, move on and faster, now.

607
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,360
只需要在上面加一点蓝色的褶皱。
Just a little bit of blue pucker right over the top.

608
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,920
对，就是这样。试着有时间去做一些漂亮的东西。
Right, that's it. Try and have time to build something nice.

609
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:31,440
大厨们，你们还有半小时。半小时，大厨们。
Chefs, you have half an hour left. Half an hour, chefs.

610
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,960
我们，我们快到时间了。
We, we are getting close now to time.

611
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,800
我们要集中精力完成任务。
We need to focus on getting finished.

612
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,360
不是……
Not...

613
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,760
在它凝固之前我需要它。
I need this before it sets.

614
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,280
好吧，继续。继续。
Right, go on. Go on.

615
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,520
这很好。
That's fine.

616
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,160
噢!你在找什么?
Ooh! What are you looking for?

617
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,400
的球。
The balls.

618
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,200
哇，哇，哇，哇，哇。你不知道里面有什么。
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You don't know what's in it.

619
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,840
哦，少了一个。
Oh, one short.

620
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,840
你确实需要一只稳健的手。
You definitely need a steady hand.

621
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,200
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

622
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:26,160
这什么?那是维斯帕巧克力棒，你把它粘在上面了吗?
What that? That's a Wispa bar, is that, you're sticking on the top there?

623
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,720
哦，我喜欢威斯帕棒。我做的事。你最喜欢什么巧克力?
Oh, I love Wispa bars. I do. What's your favourite chocolate?

624
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,120
Twix。Twix吗?毫米。真的吗?是的。
Twix. Twix? Mm. Really? Yeah.

625
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,520
伊曼纽尔。为什么不呢?
Emmanuel. Why not?

626
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,400
糕点师?希尔顿公园巷?嗯，你知道的。抱歉，伙计们，你们知道。
Pastry chef? Hilton Park Lane? Well, you know. Sorry, guys, you know.

627
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,080
最喜欢的巧克力棒?Twix。
Favourite chocolate bar? Twix.

628
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,840
是的。你知道我最喜欢吃什么吗?那是什么?人脸形状的东西。
Yes. Do you know what I really fancy eating? What's that? Something in the shape of a human face.

629
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,520
你有什么东西吗?等待,等待。
Have you got anything? Wait, wait.

630
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,400
你为什么不试试这件呢?哦，我能试穿一下吗?
Why don't you try this one on? Oh, can I try this on?

631
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:45,960
是的。显然，它是巧克力。
Yes. Obviously, it chocolate.

632
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,040
哦。就像金·凯瑞。
Oh. It's like Jim Carrey.

633
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:54,800
啊。每件展品的前面和中心都是面具。
Ah. Front and centre of every showpiece is the mask.

634
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,360
是的。这巧克力。哦,哔哔声。
Yeah. That chocolate. Oh, BLEEP.

635
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,840
将精美的手工绘制的巧克力粘在一起需要细致的触摸。
Attaching finely cast hand-painted chocolate requires a delicate touch.

636
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,440
呼吸,呼吸。
Breathe, breathe.

637
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,360
最轻微的错误举动……
The slightest wrong move...

638
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,680
现在是一天中最危险的时候。
Riskiest part of the day right now.

639
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,800
. .他们所有的努力都会付诸东流。
..and all their hard work will be destroyed.

640
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,000
好吧，好吧，好吧，你可以放手了。
OK, OK, OK, you can let go.

641
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,840
我要放手吗?
I let go?

642
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,080
是的。把我的手冻住。我也不在乎
Yeah. Just freeze my hand. I don't care.

643
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:23,760
大厨们，你们还有十分钟。还有十分钟。
Chefs, you have ten minutes left. That's ten minutes left.

644
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,840
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

645
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,800
本来可以更整洁的，但我们时间很紧。
Could be a lot neater, but we're really pushed for time.

646
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,400
哦，莎啦啦。
Ooh, sha la la.

647
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,960
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。那是五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left. That's five minutes.

648
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,720
明白了，明白了。去做吧。
Got it, got it. Go ahead.

649
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,080
你可以的。我得把它放下，然后滑动。
You've got this. I'm going to have to drop it and slide it.

650
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,880
哔哔声。在桌子边上。
BLEEP. On the edge of the table.

651
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,720
在吗?是的。
There? Yeah.

652
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,120
把面具放在那里是因为我对剧本不满意
Put the mask there because I wasn't happy with the writing

653
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,400
实际上是在镜子上，用来盖住它。
that's actually on the mirror, to kind of cover it.

654
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,400
我们能不能把可可咬掉的东西刮掉然后在镜子上写点更好的东西?
Can we scrape that Cocoa bit off and try to write something better on the mirror or no?

655
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:30,880
只是在画黑线，好让我们的贡多拉跟着走。
Just painting the black line for our gondola to follow.

656
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,640
Oop……哔哔声!
Oop... BLEEP!

657
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,360
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

658
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,600
大厨们，你们还有一分钟。这是一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left. That's one minute.

659
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,040
感受压力。
Feel the pressure.

660
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,760
我们，呃，得快点了。
We, er, need to get a move on.

661
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,600
大厨们，你们的时间到了。
Chefs, your time is up.

662
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,840
哦,哦。请离开你的展品。
Uh-oh, uh-oh. Please step away from your showpieces.

663
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,240
所以，没关系，没关系。别担心。
So, it's OK, it's OK. Don't worry.

664
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,880
这太疯狂了。
That was mental.

665
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:17,960
这是聪明的。
That's clever.

666
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,680
不融化。
Don't melt.

667
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,200
这些巧克力很好吃。
Them chocolates are nice.

668
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,840
只是…
Just...

669
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,600
短短五小时内就上演了四场精彩的假面舞会。
Four stunning masked ball showpieces in just five hours.

670
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,280
但是谁将赢得决赛的席位呢
But who will earn their place in the final stages of the competition

671
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
谁不会给人留下深刻印象呢?
and who will fail to impress?

672
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,880
我们带来了一点乐趣。
A bit of fun, we bring.

673
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,160
太酷了。我想我要在那儿待一整天。
That is cool. I'm going to be there all day, I think.

674
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,280
我喜欢摇摆的小贡多拉。
I like the little wiggling gondola.

675
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,440
你的小提琴，你如何让它充满活力是因为你如何融入
Your violin, how you bring it alive is because how you incorporate the

676
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,160
颜色。做得很好。
colour in. Really nicely done.

677
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,280
总的来说，你的故事很精彩，但对我来说，
Overall, you have a great story, but, for me,

678
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,880
你的面具不够坚固。
your mask is not strong enough.

679
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,520
我会看面具，让它更有戏剧性。
I would have looked the mask to have more drama.

680
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,200
提醒我们我们拥有什么。
Remind us what we have.

681
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,360
樱桃凝胶，然后是甘草樱桃甘纳许。
Cherry gel and then a liquorice and cherry ganache.

682
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,040
从视觉上看，非常吸引人。
Visually, very appealing.

683
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,600
它看起来就像一个波浪。
And it actually looks like a wave.

684
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,440
这种吃的感觉很有趣。
The eating sensation is quite intriguing.

685
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,040
樱桃和甘草的味道很浓，我很喜欢。
The cherry and the liquorice kick in and I actually quite like it.

686
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,360
另一个是血橙和焦糖。
And the other one is a blood orange and caramel.

687
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,320
蛋壳很薄很精致，但是太奶油了。
The shell is very thin and elegant, but it's too creamy.

688
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,080
我想让巧克力酱更有质感。
I want the ganache to have a little more texture.

689
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,120
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

690
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,520
他呼出
HE EXHALES

691
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,440
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

692
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,080
请给我们看看你的活动部件好吗?
Could you show us your moving part, please?

693
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,680
抽屉打开了。
The drawer opens.

694
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,000
好吧，好吧。
OK, all right.

695
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:30,840
同时，巧克力盒的盖子也会脱落。哦,好吧。
Also, the lid comes off the chocolate box. Oh, OK.

696
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,360
我有点失望，因为它在桌子上有点裸露。
I was a bit disappointed because it was a little bit bare on the table.

697
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,200
然后，看着你的镜子，
And then, looking at your mirror,

698
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,800
你能告诉我们背后的文字是什么吗?
could you please tell us what is the writing behind?

699
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:44,200
上面确实写着"去参加舞会了，抱抱"
It did say "Gone to the ball, XOXO",

700
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,840
但我并不满意。所以我把面具放在那里。
but I wasn't happy with it. That's why I put the mask there.

701
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,840
这就是正确使用口罩的方法。
So that was the proper use of the mask.

702
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,840
它实际上已经被蒙住了!它实际上被蒙住了!
It actually has masked! It actually masked!

703
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:55,720
我们来尝尝吧?红色的是草莓和香槟。
Shall we taste? The red one is a strawberry and champagne.

704
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,200
从视觉上看，还不错。
Visually, it's not too bad.

705
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,640
你把红色放进去是因为你想把草莓放进去。
You put the red in because you want to bring in the strawberry.

706
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,440
草莓味的，我完全尝不出味道，而且有点粉末状。
Strawberry, I could not taste it at all and it's a bit powdery.

707
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,520
你能提醒我们这里面是什么吗?
Can you remind us what's inside this one?

708
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:14,840
这是百香果巧克力酱。
It's a passion fruit ganache.

709
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,160
它看起来不像一块令人兴奋的巧克力。
It doesn't look like an exciting chocolate to look at.

710
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,200
这有点悲伤。
It's a little bit sad.

711
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,720
但总的来说，巧克力的浇铸，
But, overall, the casting of the chocolate,

712
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:24,480
看起来你投得很好。
it looks like you cast it nicely.

713
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,040
你的百香果很香。
Your passion fruit is fragrant.

714
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,400
是的。非常感谢。
Yeah. Thank you very much.

715
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,080
我的第一印象非常深刻。
My first impression is, very impressive.

716
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:41,520
我很喜欢你画面具的方式。
I really like the way you paint the mask.

717
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,720
很好。工作的整洁性有了极大的提高。
Very nice. Neatness of work has improved tremendously.

718
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:48,960
我记得第一轮，你差点就输了，
I remember the first round, where you almost went,

719
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,440
如果你想进入决赛，这就是你要做的。
and this is where it needs to be if you want to be in the final.

720
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,480
是的。
Yeah.

721
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,120
提醒我们一下你的巧克力里面有什么。
Remind us what you have inside your chocolates for us.

722
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:02,520
是的，我们有香槟，白巧克力和覆盆子。
Yes, so, we have the champagne, white chocolate and raspberry.

723
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,200
我很喜欢你放进去的铜，
I really like the copper that you put in,

724
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,640
你用的那个小玩意。
the little gadget that you use.

725
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,880
一把螺丝刀。这是一个很好的技巧。
A screwdriver. It's quite a nice technique.

726
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,240
我不太热衷。
I am not too keen.

727
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,840
它尝起来不像香槟。
It just doesn't taste like champagne.

728
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,720
现在尝起来像廉价酒。
It tastes like cheap wine now.

729
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:27,440
还有一个。百香果和焦糖。
There is another one. Passion fruit and caramel.

730
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,960
我真的很喜欢底部。
I really like the bottom.

731
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:30,800
我觉得做得很漂亮。
I think that is really beautifully done.

732
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:37,360
这一次，我愿意回到一周中的任何一天。
This one, I would go back to any day of the week.

733
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,520
百香果釉。
Passion fruit glaze.

734
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:42,400
可爱。我开始恰恰恰恰!
Lovely. I start to cha-cha-cha!

735
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,120
哦，真漂亮!
Ooh, it's beautiful!

736
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:47,200
哇，真漂亮。我喜欢它。
Wow, it's so beautiful. I love it.

737
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,360
百香果和焦糖很搭。
The passion fruit just kicks in with your caramel.

738
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,560
耸人听闻的。做得很好。干得好，伙计们。
Sensational. Well done. Good job, guys.

739
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,520
谢谢你！谢谢你！干得好，伙计们。
Thank you. Thank you. Well done, guys.

740
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,040
这是移动。
It's moving.

741
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:05,880
是的。你看到了身高，看到了红色面具。
Yeah. You see height, you see a red mask.

742
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,440
我认为这是一个非常戏剧性的作品。
A very dramatic piece, I think.

743
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,360
这是一个巧克力杯吗?是的。
Is this a chocolate cup? Yes.

744
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,720
你要香槟吗?
Would you like champagne?

745
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,760
是的,请。他们给了她一些酒。
Yes, please. They've given her some booze.

746
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:15,920
这是聪明的。
That's clever.

747
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,320
哇!哦!
Whoa! Oh!

748
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:23,360
哦,lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo !笑声
Oh, lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo! LAUGHTER

749
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,800
好主意?
Uh, good idea?

750
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:26,160
请。
Please.

751
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:31,520
你把自己的脸弄得很难看。
Well, a good effort that you cast your own face.

752
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:38,120
然而，这个面具让我想起了Lady Gaga，那件生牛肉装。
However, the mask reminds me of Lady Gaga, the raw beef dress.

753
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,240
笑声
LAUGHTER

754
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:43,040
直走。各处的装饰都很粗糙。
Straight away. The finishing everywhere is really rough.

755
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,920
如果你想在比赛中取得进步，
If you want to progress in this competition,

756
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,640
你需要注意你的整洁。
you will need to address your neatness.

757
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,080
我们在很多场合都见过你们这样。
We've seen that on too many occasions with you guys.

758
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,840
我们来尝尝吧?那个是柚子果酱
Shall we taste? That one is a yuzu jam

759
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:56,800
一杯黑巧克力和清酒甘纳许。
and a dark chocolate and sake ganache.

760
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,000
柚子很香。
The yuzu is very fragrant.

761
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,960
如果说有什么不同的话，那就是我缺少一点清酒，
If anything, I'm lacking a little bit of sake,

762
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,560
因为如果它在巧克力酱里，就会有很多苦味。
because if it's in the ganache, we've got a lot of bitterness.

763
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,280
下一个。香槟、白巧克力和玫瑰酒。
Next one. Champagne, white chocolate and rose.

764
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:14,200
甘纳许的味道和香槟混在一起非常微妙。
The ganache comes in with the champagne very, very subtle.

765
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,120
然而，当我把它转回去时，
However, when I turn it back,

766
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,960
我觉得选角没有做好。
I think the casting was not properly done.

767
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,720
选角不对。商店里到处都是，但我是说
The casting is wrong. It is all over the shop, but I mean

768
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,720
甚至是可以接受的。
way out of even anything acceptable.

769
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,080
这让我们很难享受它。
It makes it very difficult to enjoy.

770
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,360
嗯。
Mmm.

771
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,920
那瓶香槟可以给我吗?
Can I take the bottle of champagne?

772
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,120
我要一杯好酒。谢谢你！谢谢你！
I'll have a proper glass. Thank you. Thank you.

773
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,920
不能再糟了。不能更糟了。
It couldn't be worse. Couldn't be worse.

774
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:48,960
基于这两个挑战，
Based on both challenges,

775
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,040
Benoit和珍惜现在将对球队进行排名，只有前三名
Benoit and Cherish will now rank the teams and only the top three will

776
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,920
在比赛的最后阶段顶替他们的位置。
take their place in the final stages of the competition.

777
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:59,640
你参加比赛不是为了离开，你想赢得比赛。
You don't enter a competition to leave, you want to win it.

778
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:02,360
另一个团队都是大酒店，大团队。
The other team is all big hotel, big team.

779
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,640
我们只是个小公司。
We are only, like, a little company.

780
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,080
是的，这将是一种胜利。
Yeah, it will be kind of a victory to go through.

781
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,680
但这显然将是一个艰难的判断……
But it will obviously be a tough judgment...

782
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,720
. .所以…我们不知道。
..so...we don't know.

783
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,280
希望，希望我们能留下来。
Hopefully, hopefully we stay.

784
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:17,320
猫头鹰咄
OWL HOOTS

785
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,240
Benoit和珍惜已经做出了决定。
Benoit and Cherish have made their decision.

786
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,600
第一名的队伍在两项挑战中都表现出色，
The team in first place excelled in both challenges,

787
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:35,200
尤其是在昨天的秘方挑战中。
especially in yesterday's secret recipe challenge.

788
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,480
恭喜你……
Congratulations...

789
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,440
. .希尔顿公园巷的伊曼纽尔和山姆。
..Emmanuel and Sam from Hilton Park Lane.

790
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,640
你晋级到比赛的下一阶段了。
You are through to the next stage in the competition.

791
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,240
第二名是来自名胜世界的Darryl和Bharat。
In second place are Darryl and Bharat from Resorts World.

792
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,200
恭喜你，你也通过了。
Congratulations - you are also through.

793
00:44:53,360 --> 00:44:57,160
那么圣大卫酒店的迈克尔和丽贝卡，
Which leaves Michael and Rebekah from St David's Hotel,

794
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,480
还有来自Sweet Art Lab的Hideko和Theo。
and Hideko and Theo from Sweet Art Lab.

795
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,160
我不太喜欢我接下来要做的事
I'm not a massive fan of what I have to do next

796
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:05,680
因为说实话，你们都是了不起的人，更不用说厨师了。
because you guys, honestly, are amazing people, let alone chefs.

797
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,480
但是，经过深思熟虑，
But, after much deliberation,

798
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:13,440
评委们决定今晚离开我们的队伍是…
the judges decided that the team who will be leaving us tonight is...

799
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,240
. .迈克尔和丽贝卡。
..Michael and Rebekah.

800
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,960
做得很好。做得很好。
Well done. Well done.

801
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,080
我们很失望要回家了
We're disappointed to be going home,

802
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,880
但我们每一分钟都很享受，
but we've enjoyed every minute of it,

803
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:38,240
所以，是的，我不会改变它。我们已经做了…
so, yeah, like, I wouldn't change it. We've done...

804
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,560
我想改变…也许今天就把展品换了!
I'd change...change the showpiece today, maybe!

805
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
你知道吗，你已经为自己感到骄傲了。
Hey, you know, you've done yourself proud.

806
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,320
你工作很努力。哦,是的。你工作很努力。
You've worked hard. Oh, yeah. You've worked hard.

807
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:48,600
你工作很努力。
You've worked so hard.

808
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,760
现在回到正常的生活中会很奇怪。
It's going to be weird going back to normal life now.

809
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:54,040
试着在我们之间建立一个小小的家庭。
Trying to build a little family unit between us all.

810
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,160
希望我们能一直保持联系，继续学习。是的。
Hopefully we always stay in touch and keep on learning. Yep.

811
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,440
你的想法很好。
You've got good ideas.

812
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,680
我的意思是，创意是存在的。
I mean, originality is there.

813
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,920
我想我们会出去的。
I thought we would go out.

814
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:05,800
通过。通过了下一轮。
Passed through. Passed through the next round.

815
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,520
下次……
Next time...

816
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,680
走，走，走，走。
Go, go, go, go.

817
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,280
. .第二轮预赛开始。
..the second set of heats begin.

818
00:46:12,320 --> 00:46:13,800
后退，后退，后退，后退。
Back, back, back, back.

819
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,400
有六个全新的专业团队。
With six brand-new professional teams.

820
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,080
如果出了问题，都是他的错。
If it all goes wrong, it's his fault.

821
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,560
谁将掌握这些微缩模型?
Who will master the miniatures?

822
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:20,760
这些很漂亮。
These are beaut.

823
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,600
还有她的法式蛋糕梦……
And whose patisserie dreams...

824
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:23,920
别倒霉，别倒霉!
Don't jinx it, don't jinx it!

825
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:26,360
. .会以一场巨大的混乱告终吗?
..will end in a monumental mess?

826
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:29,000
哦,哔哔声!
Oh, BLEEP!

827
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,800
我拒绝吃这个。
I refuse to eat this.

828
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,120
这太残忍了。
That was brutal.

1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,800
大家好，欢迎来到《烘焙大赛:专业版》。
Hello, and welcome to Bake Off: The Professionals.

00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:04,240
我叫汤姆·艾伦。

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:09,560
我们正在寻找英国最好的专业糕点师。
We're searching for Britain's best professional pastry chefs.

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,280
好吧，我在寻找幸福，当然，这也是，为什么不呢?
Well, I'm searching for happiness but, sure, that too, why not?

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,800
今天我们有六支新队伍准备给大家留下深刻印象。

00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:21,320
利亚姆，你就像杰米·奥利弗和我的糕点师瓦莱丽。
Liam, you're like the Jamie Oliver to my Patisserie Valerie.

00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,320

We're nervous, definitely, but we're ready for today. Go, go.

我想说这是我做过的最重要的事情
I would say this is the biggest thing I've done

00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,760

00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,920
. .还有两项艰巨的挑战。
..And two daunting challenges.

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,520
我不想去想现在的时间。
I don't want to think about the time now.

26
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,920
我们将会发现这些队伍中是否有…
We're about to discover if any of these teams...

27
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,280
这些鱼很漂亮。

41
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,640
评委们的第一个挑战，迷你经典。

42
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,360
这是对传统糕点技艺的真正考验。
A true test of traditional patisserie skills.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,640
你们必须生产两批，每批24个，
You must produce two batches, 24 of each,

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,120
每批面点都必须完全相同。
and each pastry within those batches must be absolutely identical.

45
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,960
我选择了新桥。
I've chosen Pont Neuf.

46
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,400
这是一种法式经典糕点，有酥皮
It's a French classical pastry, which has a puff pastry case

00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,920
内馅有苹果泥、法式酥皮和泡芙酥皮。
filled with an apple compote, creme patissiere and choux pastry.

48
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,520
虽然这是一个非常简单的汇编，

49
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,720
这在技术上具有挑战性。

50
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,520
和珍惜。大厨们，我选了柠檬挞。

53
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:51,960
请注意，厨师们，这是我的最爱之一。
Be warned, chefs, this is one of my all-time favourites.

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,400
别让我失望。
Do not disappoint me.

55
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,400
我不知道厨师们怎么样，珍爱，
I don't know about the chefs, Cherish,

56
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,200
但我绝不会让你失望
but I would never disappoint you.

57
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,840
不敢。所以,厨师,
Wouldn't dare. So, chefs,

58
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,520
你有三个半小时的时间，现在开始计时。
you have three and a half hours and your time starts now.

59
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,880
好了，开始吧。你能把下面的筛子递给我吗?
All right, we're on. Can you pass me my sieve from down there?

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,320
四个鸡蛋，细砂糖，黄油。
Four eggs, caster sugar, butter.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
要在三个半小时内制作48个模型
With 48 miniatures to produce in just three and a half hours...

62
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,240
我们有很多事要做。
We've got a lot to do.

63
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,680
. .团队管理和组织将是关键。
..Team management and organisation will be key.

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,080
小心你的腿，小心你的腿。
Watch your legs, watch your legs.

65
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,440
我们知道我们的计划是什么。我们知道自己是如何计时的
We know what our plan is. We know how we timed ourselves,

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
这就是我们要做的。
so that's what we're going to do.

67
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,560
全新的热火，六支新队伍。
Brand-new heat, six new teams.

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:35,960
我想让厨师们给我展示他们所有的手艺，然后给我摆出来。
I want the chefs to show me all they have and put it out for me.

69
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:41,880
我想看到的是24的创新和创意
What I would like to see is 24 innovative and creative

70
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,680
香橼酒。它是由sablee制成的，一种甜酥皮，
Tarte au Citron. It's made from sablee, a sweet pastry casing,

71
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,800
里面是漂亮柔滑的柠檬馅。
and filled with a beautiful, silky smooth, lemon filling.

72
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,600
它们必须精确、一致，最重要的是，
They have to be precise, identical and, most important,

73
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,360
我想让他们在香橼酒上贴上自己的印记。
I want them to put their own stamp on the Tarte au Citron.

74
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:03,400
厨师们必须在每一步都表现出色
The chefs will have to demonstrate excellence at every step

75
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,560
如果他们想要达到评委严苛的标准。
of the bake if they're to meet the judges' exacting standards.

76
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,600
是啊，别这样。
Yeah, don't do it like this.

77
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,760
把所有的都放进去。这不是偶数。
Just put all of it. That's not even.

78
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
队长穆斯塔法和他经验不足的队友
And team captain Mustapha and his less experienced team-mate

79
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,400
我们仍然充满信心。
are still feeling confident.

80
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,520
我们有技能。我知道这很有压力
We've got the skills. I know it's a pressure,

81
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,120
但我们一定会做到的。
but we'll make it happen for sure.

82
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,760
穆斯塔法不仅是一名副糕点师，还担任讲师
As well as being a sous pastry chef, Mustapha also instructs

83
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,200
Clink是一家在监狱培训囚犯的慈善机构
at the Clink, a charity that works in prisons training inmates

84
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,160
出狱后在高级餐厅工作。
for careers in fine dining after their release.

85
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,800
他选择了凯文，一个才华横溢但刚从Clink毕业的学生，
He's chosen Kevin, a talented but recent graduate of the Clink,

86
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,120
和他一起参加比赛。
to join him in the competition.

87
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,680
穆斯塔法的玻璃圆顶上有层层柠檬玛德琳海绵蛋糕，
Mustapha's glazed domes with layers of lemon madeleine sponge,

88
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,840
柠檬蛋白霜慕斯，
lemon meringue mousse,

89
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,440
柠檬果酱和柠檬奶油可能看起来不像柠檬蛋挞，
lemon marmalade and lemon cream may not look like a Tarte au Citron,

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,200
但它尝起来肯定像。
but it should certainly taste like one.

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,880
说实话，我在这里一直很安全。
I've played safe in here, honestly.

92
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,440
最重要的是味道。
It's just all about the flavour.

93
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,520
对于他们的口味，凯利和凯蒂要做点什么
For their flavours, Kelly and Katie are going for something

94
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,200
更有实验性一点。
a little more experimental.

95
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,240
我们决定把伯爵茶放进去。
We decided to put Earl Grey into it.

96
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,560
有一些香草的味道。
It's got some vanilla tones going through it.

97
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,480
它还是很有柑橘味，所以我觉得柠檬还是最吸引人的，
It's still quite citrusy, so I think lemon is still the star attraction,

98
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,760
但是你在后面看到了这个。
but you've just got this at the back.

99
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,280
还有这个可爱的香草味的。
As well, just this lovely, vanilla-y, ooh.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:15,320
凯利和凯蒂在著名的WI烹饪学校教糕点，
Kelly and Katie teach patisserie at the renowned WI Cookery School,

101
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,760
他们渴望证明WI还有更多的东西
and they're keen to prove there's more to the WI

102
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,680
而不仅仅是果酱和维多利亚海绵蛋糕
than just jam and Victoria sponge.

103
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,400
他们的柚子酒将会看到一个光滑的柠檬巴瓦卢瓦圆顶
Their Tarte au Citron will see a glazed lemon bavarois dome

104
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,600
周围是佛手柑凝乳和茶味凝胶
surrounded by bergamot curd and, for their tea flavoured gel

105
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,080
和萨博利基地，他们用的不是普通的伯爵茶。
and sablee base, they're using no ordinary Earl Grey.

106
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,560
这是一种特殊的混合物。
It's a special blend.

107
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,360
它叫《少女灰》。
It's called Girly Grey.

108
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,880
显然，作为一支全女子球队，
Obviously, being an all girl team as well,

109
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
我们觉得这是个不错的小…
we thought that was a nice little...

110
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,920
闻起来好吗?这里有一点乐趣。
Does it smell good? A bit of fun there.

111
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,360
很有柑橘味。
It's very citrusy.

112
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,160
闻起来很有柑橘味，所以我明白了。
It smells very citrusy, so I see the connection.

113
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,960
你知道我喜欢你什么吗?
You know what I like about you?

114
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
女孩的力量。
Girl power.

115
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,800
肯定。加油，女性力量!
Definitely. Go, girl power!

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,440
不会让我失望的。
Not going to disappoint me.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,160
绝对不会。绝对不是。
Definitely not. Absolutely not.

118
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,440
凯莉和凯蒂并不是唯一依靠女性力量的人。
Kelly and Katie aren't the only ones relying on a bit of girl power.

119
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,880
我带来了我女儿的尺子。
I brought my daughter's ruler.

120
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,400
她不知道我拿了，但宽度正好。
She doesn't know I've got it, but it's the right width.

121
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,080
除了他女儿的帮助，
As well as help from his daughter,

122
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,640
队长格雷厄姆，已经让他的老板迪恩报名了。
team captain, Graham, has enrolled his boss, Dean.

123
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:08,880
这次情况完全不同了，所以他最好对我好一点。
The shoe's on the other foot this time, so he'd better be nice to me.

124
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,680
我一直对他很好，所以…
I'm always nice to him, so...

125
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,840
这对搭档在银石赛道工作
This duo work at Silverstone,

126
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,760
他们已经习惯了为数千人提供餐饮的压力
and they're used to the pressure of catering for thousands of people

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
在维修区上方的厨房里。
from their kitchen above the pit lane.

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,440
我们的任务是让银石为我们的食物而出名。
The mission is to put Silverstone on the map for our food.

129
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,880
可能会以你的名字命名一个角落。
Might name a corner after you.

130
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,960
是的,也许吧。
Yeah, maybe.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,640
格雷厄姆正在放一块柠檬凝乳
Graham is placing a cube of lemon curd embellished

132
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,720
用覆盆子凝胶和蛋白霜做成一个独立的糕点轮。
with raspberry gel and meringue into a freestanding pastry wheel.

133
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,760
我想在银石赛道会有很多重大赛事。
At Silverstone, you have a lot of big events, I imagine.

134
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,840
是的，我们有大奖赛，经典赛，摩托大奖赛。
Yeah, we have the Grand Prix, Classics, Moto GP.

135
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,600
很有压力吗?是的,一流的。
Very stressful? Yeah, big-time.

136
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,200
当你有30名厨师需要照顾时，
When you've got a brigade of 30 chefs to look after,

137
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,440
这很不一样。
it's quite different.

138
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,360
迪恩，他有时会发脾气吗?
Dean, does he have tantrums sometimes?

139
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,800
呃…两者都做一点。对，他吼了一声就走了。
Er... Do a bit of both. Yeah, he gets a bit shouty then walks off.

140
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,440
很好，我希望我们能看到。
Great, well, I hope we get to see that.

141
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,520
你可能会，也可能不会。
Yeah, you might do, you might not.

142
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,160
骂了几句，又骂了几句。
A bit of swearing, a bit of effing and jeffing.

143
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,480
是的。我以前曾因语言问题被责备过。
Yes. I've been told off for my language before.

144
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,880
可爱。记住，这不是公众投票，所以无所谓。
Lovely. Remember, it's not a public vote, so it doesn't matter.

145
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,000
你可以在整个比赛过程中都是一个正确的BLEEP。
You can be a right BLEEP the whole way through this competition.

146
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,880
不，没关系。你不需要让任何人喜欢你。
No, it doesn't matter. You don't have to make anyone like you.

147
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,520
请不要鼓励他。哦!
Don't encourage him, please. Oh!

148
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,520
斯拉芙和玛丽亚不会有爆发的危险。
There's no risk of an outburst from Slav and Maria.

149
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,320
我们有点安静，但这就是我们工作的方式。
We are a bit quiet, but that's how we are working.

150
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
我们一般都很安静。
We are very quiet in general.

151
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,320
作为厨师有点不寻常。
A bit unusual as chefs.

152
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,520
斯拉夫和玛丽亚在精品巧克力店R Chocolate工作，
Slav and Maria work at boutique chocolatiers R Chocolate,

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,720
定制美食。

154
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,080
必应(Bing) !
Bing!

155
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,240
所以斯拉夫人忍不住要加入
So Slav couldn't resist incorporating

156
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,240
白巧克力布丁放进柠檬挞里，
white chocolate feuilletine into his lemon tart,

157
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,040
浇上柠檬慕斯和柠檬沙司。
topping off lemon mousseline and a lemon sablee disc.

158
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,520
看我的小纱布多亮啊!
Look how shiny my feuilletine is!

159
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,840
它是如此闪亮。
It's so shiny.

160
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,280
是的，是的。这是我们的白巧克力小蛋糕，
Yeah, it is. That is our white chocolate feuilletine,

161
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,560
非常闪亮。好。
which is very shiny. Good.

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,640
虽然大多数团队都选择了当代设计，
While most teams have opted for contemporary designs,

163
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,920
琳恩和罗曼不会冒险的。
Leanne and Roman are taking no chances.

164
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:51,400
我们坚持经典。
We're sticking to the classic.

165
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,800
这是我们的工作，希望他们会喜欢。
It's what we do at work, so hopefully they'll like it.

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,800
在只有23岁和26岁的时候，
At only 23 and 26 years old,

167
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,720
来自Hotel Cafe Royal的Leanne和Roman是最年轻的团队
Leanne and Roman from Hotel Cafe Royal are the youngest team

168
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,800
在这激烈的竞争中。虽然看起来很传统，
in this heat of the competition. Although it might look traditional,

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:09,000
它们赋予了柠檬酸挞的核心风味
they're giving their Tarte au Citron's core flavour

170
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,560
加入甜菜根和百里香的独特风味

171
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,000
意大利蛋白糖饼。

172
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,320
甜菜根，百里香和柠檬?上次我吃了甜菜根，百里香和柠檬，
Beetroot, thyme and lemon? Last time I had beetroot, thyme and lemon,

173
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,240
这是开胃菜，配一些油醋沙司。
that was as a starter with some vinaigrette.

174
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,440
我想这些味道混合在一起会让你惊叹不已。
I think the flavours together will wow you.

175
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,960
因为我觉得你不指望它味道好，
Because I don't think you're expecting it to taste nice,

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
但希望它会。
but hopefully it will.

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,520
好的，甜菜根和柠檬。
OK, beetroot and lemon.

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,920
我能说什么呢?我们走着瞧。
What can I say? We shall see.

179
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,040
谢谢你！再见。
Thank you. See you later.

180
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,200
我不太确定他们是否喜欢我们的计划!
I'm not too sure if they like our plan!

181
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,360
不，我不认为……
No, I don't think...

182
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,840
还有烘蛋挞……
With tart cases baking...

183
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,960
这些是我的泡芙糕点呼啦圈。
These are my choux pastry hula hoops.

184
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,400
希望他们会没事。
Hopefully they'll be fine. ..

185
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:49,000
. .团队需要利用每一分钟来完善他们的填充物。
..The teams need to use every minute to perfect their fillings.

186
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,520
埃迪和马希德希望增加他们的饱腹感
And Eddie and Mahshid are hoping to boost their filling

187
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,920
加上一点花的力量。
with a touch of flower power.

188
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:56,120
在上面，我们有一个独立的柠檬凝乳和芙蓉果冻
On top, we've got a freestanding lemon curd and hibiscus jelly to

189
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,640
要强调味道。
really emphasise the flavour.

190
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,200
艾迪和马希德在世界著名的伦敦萨沃伊工作。
Eddie and Mahshid work at the world famous Savoy in London.

191
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,680
他们想把下午茶的优雅带来
They want to bring the elegance of their afternoon tea

192
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,000
与艾迪精心制作的酥皮蛋糕比拼
to the competition with Eddie's delicately waved pastry base,

193
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,120
最后撒上柠檬乳，
topped off with a piped lemon curd,

194
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,360
柠檬海绵，木槿和黑加仑果冻块。
lemon sponge and hibiscus and blackcurrant infused jelly cubes.

195
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,040
你打算怎么做木槿果冻?
How are you going to set your hibiscus jelly?

196
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,440
明胶。所以你用的是鱼胶?
With gelatine. So you're using a fish gelatine?

197
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,280
鱼明胶。你觉得你有足够的时间来凝固你的明胶吗?
Fish gelatine. Do you think you have enough time to set your gelatine?

198
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,720
是的，它会凝固。我希望如此。
Yes, it will set. I hope so.

199
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,280
说到时间，我们让他们继续吧?
Speaking of time, shall we let them crack on?

200
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,800
我想我们应该。我认为这是个好主意。
I think we should. I think that's a good idea.

201
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,360
我们应该晚点再来。来吧，伙计们。
We should come back later. Come on, guys.

202
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
厨师们，祝你们好运。
Good luck, chefs.

203
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,040
除非他们很快就把牙补好，
Unless they set their fillings quickly,

204
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
各队将没有时间组装零件。
the teams will run out of time to assemble their parts.

205
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,880
加上冰柜，加上冰柜。快走，快走。
Plus freezer, plus freezer. Go quickly, quickly.

206
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,400
快，快，快。
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

207
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,160
但是，与其他团队不同的是，
But, unlike all the other teams,

208
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,920
琳恩和罗曼打算在他们的案子里伪造文件，
Leanne and Roman plan to cook their filings in their tart cases,

209
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:51,320
所以他们需要额外的时间来做第二次烘焙。
so they'll need to find extra time for a second bake.

210
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,320
一旦挞烤好了，我就可以加入挞粉了。
As soon as the tarts are part baked, I can add the tart mix.

211
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,680
都是关于烹饪的。
It's all about the cooking.

212
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,640
大厨们，你们还有一个半小时。
Chefs, you have an hour and a half left.

213
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,840
用力，请用力一点。
Push, push a little bit, please.

214
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:07,880
是的,厨师。
Yes, chef.

215
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
而不是让他们的填充物牢固，
Instead of setting their fillings firm,

216
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,680
艾迪不小心把它们冻住了。
Eddie has accidentally frozen them solid.

217
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
我们现在要哔哔了。
We're going to be BLEEP now.

218
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,200
我们需要重新启动我们的东西。
We need to restart our stuff.

219
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
我们必须，
We're going to have to,

220
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,440
因为我不会把这个拿给评委看的。
because I'm not going to serve that to the judges.

221
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
这是不可接受的。我得抓紧时间，不然我们就不
It's not acceptable. I need to crack on with this otherwise we're not

222
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:38,240
可以做任何东西。柠檬凝乳的配方在哪里?
going to be able to serve anything. Where's that lemon curd recipe?

223
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,400
小心些而已。
Be careful.

224
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,480
你能把门打开吗?
Can you get this door?

225
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,600
好的，我去拿。
Yeah, I'll get it.

226
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,880
它可以更好。
It could be better.

227
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,280
它可以更好。因为冰箱的情况，
It could be a lot better. Because of the freezer situation,

228
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,640
我得重做柠檬凝乳和芙蓉果冻做蛋挞。
I have to remake the lemon curd and the hibiscus jelly for the tart.

229
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,640
这里越来越热了，还是只有我这么觉得?
It's getting hot in here now, or is it just me?

230
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
它是热的。
It's hot.

231
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,120
如果用完美的柠檬挞给人留下深刻印象还不够困难的话……
If trying to impress with perfect lemon tarts wasn't tough enough...

232
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,920
这些团队还必须处理一批伯努瓦的经典新桥。
The teams also have to tackle a batch of Benoit's classic Pont Neuf.

233
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:10,520
一座古典的新桥，非常传统
A classical Pont Neuf, very traditional

234
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:13,640
法式小食谱，我很喜欢。
French little recipe, which I love.

235
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,080
第一步，做酥皮。
So, first step, the puff pastry.

236
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,000
面点要完美。
The pastry needs to be perfect.

237
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,200
在酥皮上铺一层苹果泥，
Line your pastry case, a little layer of apple compote,

238
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,280
将酥皮，奶油和泡芙酥皮混合在一起，捏成一团。
the combination of pastry, cream and choux pastry, pipe in a nice blob.

239
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,240
在上面，一个可爱的酥皮交叉，
On the top, a lovely puff pastry cross,

240
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,640
放入烤箱烤至金黄。
bake in the oven until nice and golden.

241
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:38,680
釉上红醋栗果酱，另外两个角涂上糖粉。
Glaze with redcurrant jam, icing sugar in the other two corners.

242
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
它们都必须完美和精确。
They all have to be perfect and precise.

243
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,320
这将是一个挑战。
That will be the challenge.

244
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,880
这看起来很简单，但伯努瓦期待完美的执行
It may seem simple, but Benoit will expect a perfect execution

245
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,000
这部经典的每一个元素。
of every element of this classic.

246
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,480
我们都是WI成员。
We're both WI members.

247
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,680
如果我们不擅长果酱，那就会很…
If we suck at jam, it's going to be very...

248
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,280
尴尬。非常尴尬。
Embarrassing. Very embarrassing.

249
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,800
尽管这些元素都很熟悉，但新桥
And, although those elements are familiar, the Pont Neuf

250
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,960
它本身可能不是。
itself may not be.

251
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,840
你试过多少次了?
How many times have you tried this?

252
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
呃…关于一次。
Er... About once.

253
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,960
一次?一次。一次!
Once? Once. Once!

254
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,280
你试过一次新桥?!
You've tried the Pont Neuf once?!

255
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,560
这是正确的。第一次成功了吗?
That's right. And did it work the first time?

256
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,080
是的。新手的好运气?
Yeah. Beginner's luck?

257
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,280
别倒霉，别倒霉!
Don't jinx it, don't jinx it!

258
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,960
我们不应该这么说。我知道你会再次成功的。
We shouldn't say that. I know you're going to nail it again.

259
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,680
是的。我要把它砸了。来吧，孔蒂。
Yes. I'm going to smash it. Come on, compote.

260
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,840
来吧。厨师,厨师。
Come on. Cook, cook.

261
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,280
煮苹果做果盘是一种微妙的平衡。
Cooking apples for a compote is a delicate balancing act.

262
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,760
它看起来很漂亮。
It's looking beautiful.

263
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,120
如果水果现在还没有充分还原，等会儿烤的时候，
If the fruit isn't reduced enough now, when baked later,

264
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,080
多余的水分会变成蒸汽，
excess moisture will turn to steam,

265
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,840
在糕点中间形成气穴。
causing air pockets in the centre of the pastries.

266
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,040
泥做的。做得很好。
Compote's done. Well done.

267
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,280
谢谢你！我喜欢表扬。
Thank you. I like some praise.

268
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,240
在新桥的拱顶上有一种更不寻常的填充物……
In a Pont Neuf on top of the compote is a more unusual filling...

269
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,720
这是泡芙酥皮和奶油的混合物。
It's a choux pastry and creme pat mixed together.

270
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,920
. .格雷厄姆正在努力让它变稠。
..That Graham is struggling to thicken.

271
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,160
这不是BLEEP烹饪。
It's not BLEEP cooking.

272
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,960
开始了，快，你落后了，伙计。
It's on, quick, you're behind, mate.

273
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,080
不，我们很好。
No, we're all right.

274
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,320
我们现在压力很大，这是肯定的。
We are under the pressure now, for sure.

275
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,440
引擎盖上的一切都很好。
It's all good in the hood.

276
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:11,200
一旦组装完毕，新桥至少需要30分钟
Once assembled, the Pont Neuf will need at least 30 minutes

277
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,400
正确烘焙。
to bake correctly.

278
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,640
但是在填馅上浪费了时间，只用了40分钟，
But having lost time on their fillings, and with just 40 minutes,

279
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,160
剩下的格雷厄姆和迪恩还没做好。
remaining Graham and Dean's still aren't ready for the oven.

280
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,880
他们怎么样?太薄?不太薄，伙计。
How are they? Too thin? It's not too thin, mate.

281
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,760
一切都运行得很好。
It's all working quite nicely.

282
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,120
琳恩和罗曼还需要烤他们的柠檬挞馅。
And Leanne and Roman still need to bake their Tarte au Citron filling.

283
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:31,040
我一点也不放松。到新桥要花20分钟。
I'm not relaxed. The Pont Neuf is going to take 20 minutes.

284
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,160
这要花20分钟。
This is going to take 20 minutes.

285
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,040
我们还有35分钟。
And we've got 35 minutes left.

286
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:38,640
所以…我会准备好做柠檬酱的釉料。
So... Will try to get the glaze ready for my lemon sauce.

287
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,600
如果我幸运的话。
If I'm lucky.

288
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,080
我知道你现在在想什么。
I know what you think about the time now.

289
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,200
是啊，我们现在就在悬崖边上。
Yeah, we're right on the edge now.

290
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,280
先把这个做好，然后看看有没有时间煮。
Got to get this done and then, see if we've got time to cook it.

291
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,320
各位，你们有半个小时的时间!
You've got half an hour, everyone!

292
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,520
半小时,厨师!
Half-an-hour, chefs!

293
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,800
半小时了!真的吗?
Half-an-hour left! Really?

294
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,960
我希望你有足够的时间完成所有的事情。
I hope you've got enough time to finish everything.

295
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,320
我们就快到了。
We're almost there.

296
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,280
基本上，组装是最耗时的部分。
Basically, it's the assembly that's the time-consuming bit.

297
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
我们现在落后了。
We're behind now.

298
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,840
因为我们只剩下半小时了，凝乳还没凝固。
Because we only have half an hour left and the curd has not set.

299
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,720
这些娃娃真漂亮。
These babs are beaut.

300
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,800
谢谢你！16,18,20,22。
Thank you! 16, 18, 20, 22.

301
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,440
是的，我们所有的元素都融合在一起了。
Yeah, all our elements are coming together now.

302
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
这道菜刚刚上桌。
It's just getting on the plate really.

303
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:33,760
马希德有足够的时间重新制作她的柠檬凝乳。
Mahshid has had just enough time to remake her lemon curd.

304
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,000
我们可以用柠檬凝乳，感谢上帝。是吗?是的。
We can use the lemon curd, thank God. Yeah? Yeah.

305
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,240
现在我们完全在哔哔声中。
Now we're completely in the BLEEP.

306
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:41,560
但现在另一支队伍与冰柜发生了冲突。
But now another team has fallen foul of the freezer.

307
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,840
凯丽和凯蒂做蛋挞的重要元素
A vital element of Kelly and Katie's tart,

308
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,880
茶味凝胶已冻成固体。
the tea flavoured gel has frozen solid.

309
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,360
凝胶的作用不太好。
The gel isn't going very well.

310
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,560
哦,废话。我们就这样算了吧?
Oh, crap. Should we just leave it?

311
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,600
先不管它吧。
Just leave it for now.

312
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,960
管一下就行了。
The piping will do.

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,640
这是必须的。我们没有别的选择。
Well it's going to have to do. We have no other choice.

314
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
他们煮得过久。
They're overcooked.

315
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:08,200
啊,哔哔声。我现在不想待在这里。
Ah, BLEEP. I don't want to be here right now.

316
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,080
我不是在开玩笑。
I'm not even joking.

317
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,920
所以，柠檬挞煮过头了。
So, the lemon tart overcooked.

318
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,720
大厨们，你们还有15分钟!
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left!

319
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,440
还剩15分钟!
15 minutes left!

320
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,800
你掉了一个?是的，我掉了一个。
You dropped one? Yeah, I dropped one.

321
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,200
所以只剩下一个了。
So we've only got one left.

322
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,320
我们只能再失去一个。
We can only lose one more.

323
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,120
它们需要冷却。除此之外，他们还需要更多。
They need to cool. Any more, they need more.

324
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,040
或者它们会坍塌。这还是错的吗?
Or they're going to collapse. Is it wrong, still?

325
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,240
不，不，不，这没有错。
No, no, no, it's not wrong.

326
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,200
一致性。
Uniformity.

327
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,320
这真的很苍白。我很抱歉。
This is really pale. I'm sorry.

328
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,040
快，快，快，快!
Go, go, go, go!

329
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,480
厨师!你还有一分钟!
Chefs! You have one minute left!

330
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,240
我们不可能把果酱放进去。
We're not going to be able to put the jam in.

331
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,960
我为他们担心。哦,男孩。
I'm scared for them. Oh, boy.

332
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,160
来吧，进去吧。
Come on, just go in.

333
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,320
哦,哔哔声!
Oh, BLEEP!

334
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,600
厨师!你的时间到了!
Chefs! Your time is up!

335
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,480
我很沮丧。
I'm so frustrated.

336
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,000
我们还有五分钟就到。
We're five minutes off of that.

337
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,440
就是这样，哔哔的五分钟。
That's all it was, five BLEEP minutes.

338
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,680
我们的六支新队伍现在必须面对珍爱和伯努瓦的评判
Our six new teams now have to face the judgment of Cherish and Benoit

339
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,480
这是第一次。
for the very first time.

340
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,720
萨,
The Savoy,

341
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,800
请把你的迷你经典作品拿过来好吗?
could you please bring your miniature classics to the table?

342
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,400
我们有24条新路…
We've got 24 Pont Neufs...

343
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,200
. .烤。
..nicely baked.

344
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,240
烤得很好。
Really nicely baked.

345
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,800
哎呦。
Whoops.

346
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,000
不幸的是，面点的外面已经熟了，
Unfortunately, the pastry's cooked on the outside,

347
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,200
里面还没煮熟。
the inside is seriously undercooked.

348
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,680
都是因为你的蒸汽。
All because of your steam.

349
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,160
这个小蛋糕的挑战在于如何管理蒸汽。
The challenge of this petit gateau is management of that steam.

350
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,760
它太酸了，我不喜欢。
It's too acidic to my liking.

351
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,320
我原则上同意珍爱的观点。
I agree with Cherish in principle.

352
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,600
它可能有点酸
It's maybe a little bit acidic

353
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,080
但是，因为它的酸度，你会有一点新鲜感
but, because of the acidity, you've got a bit of freshness

354
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
这就是我在新桥寻找的东西。
which is what I was looking for with the Pont Neuf.

355
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,360
柠檬馅饼。
Lemon tart.

356
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,040
非常有创意，这就是我们想要的。
Very innovative and creative, this is what we're looking for.

357
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,160
是的，是的，绝对的。
Yeah, yeah, definitely.

358
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,680
你应该为此感到骄傲，
You should be very proud of this,

359
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
你是如何解决问题的
of the way I see you rectified your problem.

360
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,400
我印象非常深刻。
I was very impressed.

361
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
谢谢你！
Thank you.

362
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,760
我喜欢你的芙蓉果冻。
I like your hibiscus jelly.

363
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,960
和柠檬搭配效果很好。
Works well with the lemon.

364
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,480
我觉得很相配。
I think it matches very well.

365
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,640
你的柠檬，黑加仑和木槿，
Your lemon and your blackcurrant and hibiscus,

366
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,800
很漂亮，做得很好。
beautiful, well done.

367
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,400
非常感谢。谢谢你！
Thank you very much. Thank you.

368
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,640
啊,笨蛋!
Ah, boobs!

369
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,600
至于新桥，它的边缘相当粗糙。
With the Pont Neuf, it's pretty rough on the edges.

370
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
我们看不太清楚十字架。
We can't see the cross very well.

371
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,640
这果酱看起来不像果酱。
The jam doesn't look like a jam.

372
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,240
哦。
Oops.

373
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,640
里面有很多蒸汽。毫米。
A lot of steam inside. Mm.

374
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,440
对不起，还没煮熟。我就是吃不下。
Sorry, it's not cooked. I just can't eat it.

375
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,480
柠檬蛋挞。我们试试好吗?是的。
The lemon tart. Shall we try? Oui.

376
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,440
你可以看到，基本上，它没有上釉。
You can see, basically, it's not glazed.

377
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,000
它非常非常不整洁。
It is very, very untidy.

378
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,880
实际上很愉快。嗯，我喜欢那种犀利的感觉。
It's actually pleasant. Mm. I like that little sharpness.

379
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,800
有一种可爱的感觉，你怎么说?停吗?
There is that lovely ting, tinge, how do you say that? Ting?

380
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,360
活力。活力。唐。
Zing. Zing. Tang.

381
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,200
活力汤。Zing tang，新词。
Zing tang. Zing tang, new word.

382
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,120
啊。
Ah.

383
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,680
至少你没有一个大的蒸汽袋。
At least you don't have a large pocket of steam.

384
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:04,120
但通常情况下，它的质地会让它稍微淡一些。
But normally the texture will make it slightly lighter.

385
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,080
它不再是新桥了。
It is not a Pont Neuf any more.

386
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:08,440
这更像是一个果馅饼。
This is more like a flan.

387
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,080
我只想尝尝苹果。
I'll only try the apple.

388
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,000
正如你所看到的，它是生的，它会让我的肚子不舒服。
As you can see, it is uncooked, it will make my tummy upset.

389
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:17,760
柠檬馅饼。就陈述而言，你做得很好。
Lemon tart. In terms of presentation, you did very well.

390
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,400
真的很喜欢貂皮和慕斯里的搭配，
Really like the combination of your sable with your mousseline,

391
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,480
最后用你放的小蛋糕来完成。
and then finish up with the feuilletine that you put.

392
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,680
做得很好。谢谢你！
Well done. Thank you.

393
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:38,760
只是对你的果酱有点失望。
Just a little bit disappointed with your jam.

394
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,960
我觉得你的果酱应该再浓一点。
I thought your jam should be a bit thicker.

395
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,520
但也有一些技巧。
But there is some finesse.

396
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,760
十字是整齐的。
Cross is neat.

397
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:53,600
在口味方面，我们想要一种浓郁的苹果味，
In terms of flavour profile, we are looking for a strong apple flavour,

398
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,080
淡淡的香草味
a light vanilla texture of your

399
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,720
混合了法式奶油和泡芙糕点。
combined mixture of creme patissiere and choux pastry.

400
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,280
实际上，没有一种光线能穿透
None of it is actually shining through

401
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,840
它失去了它的个性。
and it loses its personality.

402
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,040
柠檬馅饼。
Lemon tart.

403
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,640
你得打扮一下，姑娘们，加油!
You need to dress it up a little bit, girls, come on!

404
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,160
对我来说，已经完成了一半。
It's half-done, for me.

405
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,680
嗯，我有柠檬
Well, I got lemon

406
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,160
但你倒了些茶进去。嗯嗯。
but you brought some tea into it. Mm-hm.

407
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,280
非常非常温和。
It's very, very mild.

408
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,280
你也看到了，我根本没碰你的糕点
Well, as you can see, I did not touch your pastry at all

409
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,160
因为我觉得里面是生的
because I think it's raw inside

410
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,960
我不得不拒绝吃你的糕点。
and I have to refuse to eat your pastry.

411
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
繁荣。
Boom.

412
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,960
那就来柠檬挞吧。柠檬馅饼。
Lemon tart, then. Lemon tart.

413
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,840
我并不想让你泄气
I don't mean to be discouraging

414
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,800
但我希望你们俩能多给点。
but I was hoping for a little bit more from you two.

415
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,040
这是厨师们发挥创造力的地方!
This is where the chefs get creative!

416
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,360
但当我看着它的时候，它会说，“啊，这只是一个馅饼。”
But when I look at it, it's, "Ah, it's only a tart."

417
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,240
我觉得你的柠檬馅煮过头了。
I think you overcooked your lemon filling.

418
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,040
这里很像鸡蛋。
Over here is very eggy.

419
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,560
还有你尝试过的所有味道
And all the flavour profiles you tried to work with

420
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,080
为了增强你的味道，没有柠檬馅饼。
to enhance your lemon tarts are not there.

421
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,240
好了，这有点基础。
OK, it's a little bit basic.

422
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:15,280
是的。
Yep.

423
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,640
怎么了，大厨?
What happened, chef?

424
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,280
我们只是没时间了，不是吗?我想是的。
We just ran out of a bit of time, didn't we, really? I think, yeah.

425
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,520
看起来，
By the looks of it,

426
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,480
你也没果酱了，是吧?
you ran out of jam, as well, didn't you?

427
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,240
还没煮熟呢。
Well, it's not cooked.

428
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,080
如果没有煮熟，就不好吃
If it's not cooked, it's not nice to eat

429
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,600
所以让我们祈祷柠檬挞能自我救赎吧。
so let's hope the lemon tart redeems itself.

430
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,720
好的。
OK.

431
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,400
糕点,再一次。
Pastry, again.

432
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,480
你做得不对。对我来说还不够熟。
You didn't cook it right. It's just under-baked for me.

433
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,520
够有趣吗?
Is it interesting enough?

434
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,880
你应该再往前推一点。
You should have pushed it a little bit further.

435
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,840
只是对自己很失望，真的。
Just disappointed with myself, really.

436
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,880
因为我知道我更好了。
Cos I know I'm better.

437
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,920
我的意思是，就我个人而言，我认为，你知道，还有很多事情要做。
I mean, personally, I think, you know, there's still all to play for.

438
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,480
为了明天的表演挑战，
For tomorrow's showpiece challenge,

439
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,040
厨师们得到了宝贵的时间
the chefs have been given a golden hour

440
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,840
准备任何需要过夜的材料。
to prepare any elements that need setting overnight.

441
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,280
所以第一天没人把它弄坏
So no-one really, like, smashed it the first day

442
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,160
但我们都同意萨沃伊比其他地方做得更好。
but we can all agree that the Savoy did better than the rest.

443
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
我认为他们目前处于领先地位。
I think they're leading at the moment.

444
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,560
但差距很小，因为每个人都差不多
But by a small margin because everybody was pretty much

445
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,080
度过了艰难的一天。
having a rough day.

446
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,960
那WI的女孩呢?
And for the girls from the WI?

447
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,120
我想象着他们的新桥
I thought visually their Pont Neuf

448
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,840
是最接近它应有的样子。
was the closest to what it should look like.

449
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,000
R巧克力队?
Team R Chocolate?

450
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,800
你知道吗，他们的柠檬挞真的很酷。
You know, their lemon tart was really cool.

451
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,400
你看，这是潜在的。
Well, you see, it is potential.

452
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,680
它们在盘子里产生的是潜力。
What they produce on the plate is potential.

453
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,360
而下面的二人组，
And the duos, perhaps, at the bottom,

454
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,440
他们更挣扎的地方，就是叮当声，
where they're struggling a little bit more, would be the Clink,

455
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,800
格雷厄姆的银石车队。是的。
Graham's team from Silverstone. Yeah.

456
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,040
还有皇家咖啡馆里琳恩的团队。
And Leanne's team from Cafe Royal.

457
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,360
所以期待明天的表演挑战。
So looking forward to tomorrow, the showpiece challenge.

458
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,200
明天什么都可能发生。
Anything can happen tomorrow.

459
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,240
我希望厨师能发挥他们的想象力。
I would like the chef to unleash their imagination.

460
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,360
当你打开门走进去，感觉很神奇，
When you open the door and you walk in and it's so magical,

461
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,520
太棒了，太性感了。
it's so wonderful, it's so sexy.

462
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,320
一个性感的展示糕点。是的。
A sexy showpiece pastry. Yeah.

463
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,200
早上好。早....早....
Good morning. Morning. Morning.

464
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,400
早上好，厨师们。希望你昨晚睡得好。
Good morning, chefs. I hope you had a good night's sleep.

465
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,480
你将需要你所有的能量
You are going to need all your energy

466
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,560
来参加今天的Showpiece挑战赛。
for today's Showpiece Challenge.

467
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,200
一切都是为了让平凡变得不平凡。
It's all about taking the ordinary and making it extraordinary.

468
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,360
就像威瑟斯彭开始供应早餐的时候。
You know, like, when Wetherspoon's started serving breakfast.

469
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,080
现在，对于这次挑战，评委们希望你们能获得灵感
Now, for this challenge, the judges would like you to take inspiration

470
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,200
这是一道经典的英式甜点
from a classic English dessert.

471
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,080
评委们，能告诉我们你们选出了哪支队伍吗?
So, judges, can you tell us what you've chosen for the teams?

472
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,600
汤姆，我们选择了伊顿公学。
Well, Tom, we have chosen Eton mess.

473
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,680
当然，我们想要一个现代的英国经典。
Of course, we want a modern twist on that British classic.

474
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:26,320
你的甜点至少要能喂饱24个人。
Your dessert must feed at least 24 people.

475
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,680
我希望你在口味和口感上有创意。
I would like you to be creative with your flavour and texture.

476
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,560
你的设计必须以美吸引我们的眼球。
Your design must capture our eye with beauty.

477
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:38,680
请注意，我们会一直盯着你。
Be warned, we will be watching you at all times.

478
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:42,240
谢谢你，珍爱，你说得既充实又恐怖
Thank you, Cherish, that was both informative and terrifying

479
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,040
同时。
at the same time.

480
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,760
你昨晚准备了一个小时，现在只剩下四个小时了
You had one hour last night to prep and you have four hours remaining

481
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,640
完成挑战。
to complete the challenge.

482
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,560
你的时间开始了……
And your time starts...

483
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,760
. .。
..now.

484
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,360
正确的。我们走吧。
Right. Let's go.

485
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,400
我们开始吧。
Let's do it.

486
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,440
当你这样做的时候，把蛋白霜涂上，直接放进烤箱。
As you're doing that, get your meringue on, get that straight in the oven.

487
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,440
伊顿公学最早是在世界著名的伊顿公学供应的
Eton mess was first served at the world-famous Eton College

488
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,760
在19世纪，
in the 1800s,

489
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:09,000
直到今天，在他们与哈罗大学的年度板球比赛中，他们仍然用这种饮料。
and it's still served today at their annual cricket match against Harrow.

490
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,880
伊顿公学的难题是，这是最基本的食谱，
The challenge with the Eton mess, it's the most basic recipe,

491
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,960
你能做的最基本的甜点。
the most basic dessert you can make.

492
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,640
当然，今天的比赛不是关于基本的。
Of course, this competition today is not about being basic.

493
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:25,440
事实恰恰相反。我们想要戏剧，我们想要技巧，我们想要惊喜。
It's the opposite. We want drama, we want skills, we want to be amazed.

494
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
“哇!”
"Wow!"

495
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,680
它是奶油、浆果和蛋白霜的完美结合，
It is beautifully combined cream, berry, and meringue,

496
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:37,160
但厨师是如何在这道甜点上烙上印记的呢
but how does the chef put a stamp onto this dessert

497
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,080
把它变成他们自己的?
and make it their own?

498
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,680
它需要是丰富多彩的。
It needs to be colourful.

499
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,640
它需要是动态的。
It needs to be dynamic.

500
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,600
它需要华丽。
It needs to be magnificent.

501
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,400
这些团队现在要建造他们宏伟的展示建筑，
The teams now have to create their magnificent showpiece structures,

502
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,320
伴随着伊顿混乱的甜点…
accompanied by Eton mess-inspired desserts...

503
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,200
静静地自信，但你永远不知道，任何事情都可能发生，真的。
Quietly confident, but you never know, anything can happen, really.

504
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:59,680
. .这是埃迪和马希德希望通过展示他们的
..which Eddie and Mahshid are hoping to achieve by showcasing their

505
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,160
队长做糖活的天赋。
team captain's flair for sugar work.

506
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,400
你今天要给我们展示什么?
What are you going to present to us today?

507
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,920
每种甜点都有自己的糖球
Each dessert is going to have its own sugar ball

508
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,640
我们要把球绕在展览品周围。
and we're going to build the balls around the Showpiece itself.

509
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,160
所以是把馅料塞进球里?
So it's a filling going inside the ball?

510
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,080
是的。哇，真令人兴奋。哇。
Yes. Oh, wow, how exciting. Wow.

511
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:18,320
埃迪的吹糖球可以包裹草莓蛋白霜，
Eddie's blown sugar spheres will encase strawberry meringue,

512
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,720
草莓酱和香蒂伊奶油，
strawberry coulis and Chantilly cream,

513
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:24,960
坐在一个同样完全由糖制成的高耸结构下。
sat beneath a towering structure also made entirely of sugar.

514
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,080
艾德，这是你的工作，对吧，做糖活?
Ed, this is your thing, isn't it, doing sugar work?

515
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,520
是的，我喜欢。你为什么这么喜欢吃糖?
Yeah, I love it. What makes you love sugar so much?

516
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:31,240
这太专业了。
It's so technical.

517
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,480
你知道，它很美。
You know, it's beautiful.

518
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,920
但制糖业的摊牌即将到来。
But a sugar work showdown is looming.

519
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,960
不顾一切地想要在昨天之后有所改善
Desperate to improve after yesterday,

520
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
琳恩和罗曼也想给大家留下好印象
Leanne and Romain are also aiming to impress

521
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,000
用这种出了名的反复无常的技巧。
with this notoriously fickle technique.

522
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,440
你对糖有信心吗?你以前做过很多吗?
So are you confident with sugar? You've done a lot before?

523
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,760
我做的不多。这绝对是一项新技能。
I haven't done much. It's a new skill, definitely.

524
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,520
哇，你真勇敢，敢做糖。
Wow, it's very brave of you to do sugar.

525
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,080
你能给我们介绍一下吗
Would you be able to take us through

526
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,120
你打算怎么建造你的Showpiece?
how you're going to build your Showpiece?

527
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
回到伊顿公学混乱的故事。
To go back to the story of the Eton mess.

528
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,080
你知道他们有赛艇队吗?是的。
You know they have a rowing team? Yes.

529
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,800
他们戴着大帽子，上面有很多花。
And they are wearing, like, big hats, lots of flowers on it.

530
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,800
啊。这就是为什么我们要做三个环
Ah. So that's why we're doing three rings

531
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,200
但每一个都有不同的技巧。
but a different technique on each one.

532
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:09,560
他们的甜品中心将配上两个五层的主菜
Their sugar work centrepiece will accompany two five-layer entremets

533
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,560
内含草莓慕斯、蛋奶冻、果冻和草莓酱。
containing strawberry mousse, set custard, jelly and strawberry glaze.

534
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,720
我不想说进展是否顺利
I don't want to say whether it's going well or not

535
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,400
因为我可能会倒霉的!
cos I might just jinx myself!

536
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,160
我今天不想说得太快，但是
Don't want to speak too fast today but

537
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,960
我们相信此刻会准时到达。
we believe to be on time at the moment.

538
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,960
所有其他球队都不吃糖
All the other teams have shunned sugar

539
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
用巧克力来建造。
and are constructing with chocolate.

540
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:29,480
昨天的微缩模型没能完成，
And after failing to finish yesterday's miniatures,

541
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,600
在今天的表演中，穆斯塔法和凯文全力以赴。
for today's showpiece, Mustapha and Kevin are going all-out.

542
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,120
伊顿的混乱反映在板球上…
Eton mess is reflected to cricket...

543
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
. .所以我在做板球拍
..so I'm making cricket bats

544
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,800
加上一些巧克力球，
with some chocolate balls,

545
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
就像板球一样。
like a ball for cricket.

546
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,280
在他的球棒和球旁边放着24套草莓慕斯
Alongside his bat and ball will sit 24 set strawberry mousses

547
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,840
含有奶油和油酥饼
containing cremeaux and confit inserts

548
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,720
还有海绵底，上面撒上蛋白霜。
and a sponge base topped off with meringue.

549
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,440
昨天过后，你有多自信?
After yesterday, how confident are you?

550
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,880
我们有信心。好。
We're confident. Good.

551
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,040
这就是我想听的。
This is what I want to hear.

552
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,360
我们很有信心，但我们这里有非常好的厨师
We're confident but we've got really good chefs in here

553
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,840
所以我们要重新集中注意力
so we'll just try to focus again

554
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,880
避免我们昨天犯的错误。
and to avoid the mistakes we did yesterday.

555
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,480
我们会按时完成的。
We'll get right and done on time.

556
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,240
凯文，我希望你今天能和穆斯塔法一起跑步?
So, I hope that Kevin, you're going to run with Mustapha today?

557
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,080
是的。我就在他后面。齿轮6。
Yep. I'm right behind him. Gear six.

558
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,080
超速。公式1。
Speeding. Formula 1.

559
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
就是这样。
That's it.

560
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,760
也是为了登上领奖台而全力以赴
Also going full throttle for a podium finish

561
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,360
第一天拖延下来的是格雷厄姆和迪恩。
after stalling on day one are Graham and Dean.

562
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
跟我们说说伊顿公学的事吧。
Talk to us about the Eton mess.

563
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,800
我们正在设计24个独立的球体
We are designing 24 individual spheres

564
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,880
我们想要一个背景来配合它
and we wanted a backdrop to go with it

565
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:31,160
所以我们在银石赛道设计了领奖台。
so we've designed the podium from Silverstone.

566
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,080
伊顿混乱……是的。
Eton mess... Yes.

567
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,560
. .在跑道上。
..on the racetrack.

568
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,160
覆盆子色的白巧克力球，
Their raspberry-glazed white chocolate spheres,

569
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
当被打碎时，
when smashed open,

570
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,760
五彩缤纷的蛋白酥
should reveal multicoloured meringues,

571
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:44,760
覆盆子凝胶和马斯卡彭凝结奶油慕斯。
raspberry gel and mascarpone clotted cream mousse.

572
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,080
马斯卡彭奶油和凝乳奶油。
Mascarpone cream and clotted cream.

573
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,080
你觉得我和伯努瓦会喜欢吃吗?
Do you think so that me and Benoit will enjoy eating it?

574
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:53,680
我认为……我希望你会喜欢。
I think... I'm hoping you're going to enjoy it.

575
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,000
因为它口感丰富，味道丰富，有很多覆盆子，
Cos it's rich, delicious, loads of flavours, loads of raspberries,

576
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,160
大量的水果。它应该是什么，真的。
loads of fruit. What it should be, really.

577
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,640
昨天，凯利和凯蒂的演讲赢得了掌声
Yesterday, Kelly and Katie won plaudits for their presentation

578
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,120
但今天，这种前景似乎不太可能了。
but today, that prospect seems a little less likely.

579
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,600
所以我们决定还是让它有点乱，
So we've decided to still keep it as a little bit of a mess,

580
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:15,120
所以它不叫伊顿整洁，所以我们去了一点……
so it's not called an Eton tidy, so we've gone for a bit of a...

581
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,400
. .这就像一个毒菌茶话会。
..well, it's like a toadstool tea party.

582
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,600
在一个两英尺高的巧克力毒菌底部，
At the base of a two-foot chocolate toadstool,

583
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,160
会有装着蛋白霜的巧克力茶杯，
there'll be chocolate teacups containing meringue,

584
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:27,160
苹果香草果酱和耶路撒冷洋蓟意式奶塔。
apple and vanilla jam and Jerusalem artichoke panna cotta.

585
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,640
你怎么把耶路撒冷洋蓟放进去了?
How come you've put Jerusalem artichoke in that?

586
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,560
所以，臭名昭著的是，在WI上，它被称为果酱和耶路撒冷，
So, infamously, with the WI, it's all renowned as jam and Jerusalem,

587
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,280
所以我们做了草莓酱，草莓和苹果酱。啊哈。
so we've made strawberry jam, strawberry and apple jam. Uh-huh.

588
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,600
我们从耶路撒冷洋蓟中得到了耶路撒冷。
And we've got the Jerusalem from the Jerusalem artichoke.

589
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,320
还有一首歌，不是吗?这是耶路撒冷之歌。
And there's a song, as well, isn't there? It's Jerusalem the song.

590
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,560
是的。这首歌是怎么唱的?
Yeah. How does the song go?

591
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:50,040
他们哼唱耶路撒冷
THEY HUM JERUSALEM

592
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,400
他们崩溃了
THEY CRACK UP

593
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,080
我想我得停下来了!
I think I've go to stop!

594
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,600
是的，请说。我头疼!
Yeah, please do. I'm getting a headache!

595
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,960
你头疼吗?从你的歌声中!
You're getting a headache? From your singing!

596
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
开玩笑!
Kidding!

597
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,800
巧克力专家斯拉芙和玛利亚带着他们的伊顿公学食堂
Chocolate experts Slav and Maria are taking their Eton mess

598
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
达到新的高度。
to explosive new heights.

599
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,400
我出生在群山之中，
I was born around mountains, OK,

600
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,400
这给了我一些启发。
so that gives me a bit of inspiration.

601
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:15,760
我们要用熔岩造一座火山。
We're going to make a volcano with lava.

602
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:22,600
火山!我们所有的混乱都会消失，就像石头落下一样。啊!
Volcano! And all our mess will be down, like rocks falling down. Ah!

603
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:25,320
斯拉夫的粉白色蛋白酥熔岩
Slav's pink and white meringue lava rocks

604
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,600
里面有桃子和覆盆子香蒂伊奶油
filled with peach and raspberry Chantilly cream

605
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,640
会坐在他的巧克力火山底部。
will sit around the base of his chocolate volcanoes.

606
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,520
所以这是山脉
So this is going to be the mountains

607
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:35,240
站在伊顿的食堂后面。
standing behind the Eton mess.

608
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:38,520
我已经有五座山了。这很好。
So I have five mountains already. That is good.

609
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,280
斯拉夫人可能比计划提前了
Slav might be ahead of schedule

610
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,520
但其他团队仍有巧克力需要回火和发霉，
but the other teams still have chocolate to temper and mould,

611
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,280
他们知道他们必须留出足够的时间让它凝固。
knowing they must leave enough time for it to set.

612
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,720
所以我在做巧克力茶杯
So I am making the chocolate teacups

613
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,840
我们要把布丁放进去。
which is what we're going to put our pudding into.

614
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,960
现在我要把巧克力铺在周围
And now I'm just spreading the chocolate around

615
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,280
所以我也要好好地敲一下。
so I'm about to give it a good banging, as well.

616
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,520
巧克力凝固后，
As their chocolate sets,

617
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,240
团队需要利用每一分钟
the teams need to use every minute

618
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:06,400
来提供评委们要求的美味馅料。
to deliver the delicious fillings the judges have demanded.

619
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,480
但是，尽管昨天已经没有时间了，
But, despite running out of time yesterday,

620
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,880
穆斯塔法正冒着另一个多层次创作的风险。
Mustapha is risking another multi-layered creation.

621
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,080
这些是插入物。
These are the inserts.

622
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,400
马斯卡彭奶油和草莓酱。
Mascarpone cream and strawberry confit.

623
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,400
我要把海绵放进去，最后再放一些新鲜的蛋白霜。
I'm going to put sponge in there and finish with some fresh meringue.

624
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,320
这是覆盆子凝胶。
This is going to be a raspberry gel.

625
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:24,520
把它放回冰箱里一会儿。
Put it back in the freezer for a bit.

626
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:28,480
我觉得很好。很显然，我只是问了我的助理，
I think it's fine. I've just, obviously, asked my assistant, er,

627
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,600
他怎么想的，因为我在想也许再来一张明胶，但是
what he thought, cos I'm thinking maybe another sheet of gelatine but

628
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,280
我想那可能很好。不要让它太粘稠。
I think that might be fine. You don't want it too gelatinous.

629
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,280
琳恩的四道主菜里都有明胶，
With gelatine in every element of Leanne's four entremets,

630
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:41,440
确保她用的量不会破坏甜点的口感
ensuring the amount she uses doesn't ruin the dessert's texture

631
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,760
是它的四倍难。
is four times as hard.

632
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,800
我已经做出了所有的成分。
So I've made all the components.

633
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,400
在每一层凝固的时候就把它叠起来。
Just building it up when each layer sets.

634
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,160
大厨们，你们已经完成一半了。
Chefs, you are halfway through.

635
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,920
研究巧克力的团队
The teams working with chocolate

636
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,640
现在要面对的是脱模的微妙任务。
now face the delicate task of demoulding.

637
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,080
我试着练习这些球体，每次我都可以。
I like kind of tried to practise these spheres, every time I could.

638
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,000
他们真的很难摆脱。
They are really hard to get out.

639
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,040
我们会尽力的。
We'll try our best.

640
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:15,520
凯利的杯子和碟子也不容易。
And Kelly's cups and saucers aren't proving any easier.

641
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,600
一个破损!
A breakage!

642
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,280
敲打桌子
BANGING ON TABLE

643
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

644
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,360
好吧。
All right.

645
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,600
该死的。
Damn.

646
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

647
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,560
我做噩梦了。
I'm having a nightmare.

648
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,560
我们到底该怎么处理这个该死的…
What the hell are we going to do about this bloody...

649
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:37,600
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

650
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,440
我们的茶杯是……主要是打破
Our teacups they are... predominantly breaking

651
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,640
所以我们可能得把它换成碎瓷器。
so we might have to change it to broken china.

652
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,040
你想让我打破最后一个吗?
Do you want me to break this last one?

653
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,560
是的。真的吗?
Yeah. Really?

654
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,880
处理巧克力可能有风险……
Working with chocolate might be risky...

655
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,600
解脱。这很好，最好能付诸实践。
Relief. That's good, it's better that it comes in practice.

656
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,040
但制糖业的竞争对手
But rivals in sugar work,

657
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,920
艾迪和罗曼将要表演最难的技巧之一
Eddie and Roman are about to take on one of the hardest techniques

658
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,000
在法式蛋糕店。
in patisserie.

659
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,800
现在，我在吃糖。
Right now, I'm doing all my sugars.

660
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,320
我们要开始把它拉出来，让它有合适的颜色。
We're going to start to pull it to give it the right colour.

661
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,800
这是非常技术性的。
It's very technical.

662
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,920
这不容易做到。
Not easy to do.

663
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,800
糖在170度时融化并变得柔软。
Sugar melts and becomes pliable at 170 degrees.

664
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,840
它粘不住。太冷了。
It won't stick. It's too cold.

665
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,600
然后必须非常迅速地操纵它，
It must then be manipulated very quickly,

666
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,360
使用热块和喷灯来保持高温。
using heat lumps and blowtorches to maintain the high temperature.

667
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,120
快拿喷灯来。快，快，快，快!
Bring the blowtorch quick. Quick, quick, quick, quick!

668
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,680
如果让它冷却几度，
If it's allowed to cool even a few degrees,

669
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,400
糖在几秒钟内就会变脆。
the sugar can become brittle in a matter of seconds.

670
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,200
这行不通。不工作。这行不通。
It's not working. Not working. It's not working.

671
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,960
因为锁住了。给我，给我，给我。
Because it's locked. Give me, give me, give me.

672
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:44,880
就这样吧，装饰一下。
We'll just keep it like that, for decoration.

673
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,680
别担心，别担心，这是哔哔声。
Don't worry, don't worry, it's BLEEP.

674
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,400
这行不通。
It's not working.

675
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,080
厨师!你还有半个小时!
Chefs! You have half-an-hour left!

676
00:34:56,400 --> 00:35:00,880
这些团队现在面临着组装甜点的艰巨任务。
The teams now face the painstaking task of assembling their desserts.

677
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,360
这是一个可怕的想法。
This is a horrible idea.

678
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,600
是的,哔哔声。这太愚蠢了。
Yeah, BLEEP. This is stupid.

679
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,680
不要破碎，不要破碎，不要破碎……
Don't break, don't break, don't break...

680
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,560
哦，你这个笨蛋。
Oh, you BLEEP.

681
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,000
太热了。
Far too hot.

682
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,360
现在开始进行集会了。
Starting to get the assembly going now.

683
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,560
只要把领奖台就位就行了。
Just need to get the podiums in place.

684
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,960
从这里开始，一切都很合适。
This is where it all starts to fit nicely.

685
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,440
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

686
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,040
来吧。我们走吧，好吗?是的，我们走吧。
Come on. Let's go, yeah? Yeah, let's go.

687
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,640
你要走哪条路?这不是正确的方式。
Which way you going? It isn't the right way.

688
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,360
伙计们，你们还剩15分钟。
Guys, you actually have 15 minutes left.

689
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,800
这是很严肃的。只是说……
That's, like, serious. Just saying...

690
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,480
好的。你可以在那里辞职。
OK. You can quit there.

691
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,960
看起来像个蘑菇。
Looks like a mushroom.

692
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,200
快乐吗?还没有，我想去那里看看。
Happy? Not yet, I want to check in there.

693
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,480
我把这个放在桌子上。
I put this one and I put it on the table.

694
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,920
就是这样。现在把它放在桌子上。现在把它放在桌子上。
That's it. Put it on the table now. Put it on the table now.

695
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,720
安全吗?是的。
Safe? Yes.

696
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,720
去吧，两个都去。我们会。
Go, both now. We're going.

697
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,960
你先来。可爱。
You go first. Lovely.

698
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,800
是吗?对，你先来。
Yes? Yeah, you go first.

699
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,800
两个，两个都看。
Both, both look.

700
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,960
快，快，快，快，快!
Go, go, go, go, go!

701
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,640
请轻轻地碰一下，推一下。
Touch and push a little bit, please.

702
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,920
是的。
Yes.

703
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,480
它必须面向那个方向。
It's got to face that way.

704
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,720
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

705
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,040
我们没有压力。
We are not stressed.

706
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,160
我们就快到了。我们完成了。
We are almost there. We are finished.

707
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:58,480
我们只需要完成最后的润色。
We just need to finish the last touches.

708
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,160
虽然我们无能为力，但还是有办法的。
There's not much we can do, but, there's something.

709
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,400
我们将礼物。
We'll present.

710
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,560
你满意吗?
Are you happy with that?

711
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,920
我对它很满意。我们都做过厨师该做的事了。
I'm chuffed with it. Hey, we've done what being a chef is.

712
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,160
用脚思考。
Thinking on your feet.

713
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:18,280
你既是厨师又是老师，不要灰心丧气。
You're a chef and you're a teacher, don't be defeatist.

714
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,600
事情发生。
Things happen.

715
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,040
哦，哔哔!
CLATTERING Oh, BLEEP!

716
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,600
对不起,迪安。就是这样，伙计。
Sorry, Dean. That's it, mate.

717
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,520
我跟丢了，伙计。
I've lost them, mate.

718
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,800
不，我刚掉了十个。
No, I've just dropped ten.

719
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,200
厨师!还剩一分钟!还剩一分钟!
Chefs! One minute left! One minute left!

720
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,520
我怎么了?
What happened to me?

721
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,360
快点，戴上，戴上!
Come on, stick them on, stick them on!

722
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,360
感觉很好，我们不用着急。
Such a good feeling that we didn't have to rush.

723
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:53,240
不，请不要让我失望。
No, don't let me down, please.

724
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:55,080
干得好，迪恩。
Well done, Dean.

725
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,680
厨师!你的时间到了!
Chefs! Your time is up!

726
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,400
天啊，我感觉太糟了!
Oh, my God, I feel so bad!

727
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,520
站在柜台后面。
Stand behind your counters.

728
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,920
他吻了他
HE KISSES HIM

729
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,840
六件精心制作的伊顿公学凌乱展示作品
Six elaborate Eton mess show pieces

730
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,680
只用了五个小时。

731
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,280
我知道。
I know.

732
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,080
从整体来看，我真的很喜欢这个概念。
Looking at as whole, I really like the concept.

733
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,960
真正让我感兴趣的是，你打碎了茶杯。
What really intrigued me, you break the teacup.

734
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,920
我要整杯喝吗?
Would I like it as a whole teacup?

735
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,600
我不这么想。但当你把它拆开时，我说，“哦，我的天哪，
I don't think so. But when you break it up, I said, "Oh, my goodness,

736
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,000
“这有多神奇?!”
"how amazing is this?!"

737
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,600
唷。
Whew.

738
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,360
还挺管用的，对吧?
It kind of worked, huh?

739
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,920
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

740
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,800
我觉得你适应了，这很好。
Well, I think you adapted, so that is great.

741
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,280
好吗?我们开始吧。
OK? So, here we go.

742
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,880
我喜欢这样。Oh-ho-ho !
I like that. Oh-ho-ho!

743
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:18,480
我觉得味道很好。
I think flavour-wise, it has worked.

744
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,040
耶路撒冷洋蓟，
The Jerusalem artichoke,

745
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:24,080
我不太确定。对我来说有点粗糙。
I'm not too sure. It's a little bit grainy for me.

746
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:33,040
看了这个展示品，我觉得你做得很好。
Looking at the showpiece, I think you did a very good job.

747
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,800
然而，它是非常安全的。
However, it's very safe.

748
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:38,360
你为这次比赛做得够多了吗?
Have you done enough for this competition?

749
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:41,080
就技能组合而言，没有优雅可言，
In terms of skill set, there is no elegance,

750
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,520
没有技巧可言。
there is no finesse.

751
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,800
无聊，无聊，无聊。
Boring, boring, boring.

752
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,440
只是奶油和蛋白霜。
It's just cream and meringue.

753
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,520
我真的很喜欢制作一个透明碗的过程，
I really enjoyed the part of creating a clear bowl,

754
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,320
吹得很完美，很难。
perfectly blown, very difficult.

755
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,520
鉴于你的演讲的优雅，
On the general elegance of your presentation,

756
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,720
它有点粗。
it's a little bit chunky.

757
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,480
我很想看到一点拉糖的成分。
I would love to see a little bit of the pulled sugar element.

758
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:19,360
好的。我们需要尝尝甜点。
OK. We need to taste the dessert.

759
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,280
概念是惊人的!
Concept is amazing!

760
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:35,280
但当我品尝这个的时候，我很失望。
But when I taste this, I'm disappointed.

761
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,800
只有三个元素。
There's only three element.

762
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,880
你有你的蛋白霜，你有你的香蒂伊，
You have your meringue, you have your chantilly,

763
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,480
这是coulis。
and you have your coulis.

764
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,720
只做三个元素不费力。
It take no effort just to do three element.

765
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:59,560
我可以看到你用了三种不同的制糖方法。
I can see that you've used three different sugar technique.

766
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,600
有一条漂亮的紫白相间的缎带。
There is the beautiful purple and white ribbon.

767
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:05,920
我认为你在向我们展示你的潜力。
I think you are showing to us that you've got potential.

768
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,560
你创造了一个由许多技能组成的设计。
You've created a design made of lots of skills.

769
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,720
它是优雅的。是啊，我觉得你今天取得了更大的成就，
It's elegant. Yeah, I think you achieved so much more today,

770
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:14,880
和昨天相比。
compared to yesterday.

771
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,800
你蛋糕里的明胶太多了。我一点也吃不下。
It's just too much gelatin in your cake. I can't eat it at all.

772
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,160
我想我们必须接受你做了一件
I think we're going to have to accept the fact that you've done a

773
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,840
你的演讲下了很大功夫
great effort on your presentation

774
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,520
带来了很多技能，
and brought a lot of skills to the table,

775
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,680
但甜点，也许只做了一半。
but the dessert, perhaps, half done.

776
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,440
我认为投入在设计上的工作量
I think the amount of work put into the design

777
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:01,800
比赛期间的展示是相当基本的。
of the showpiece during the competition is pretty basic.

778
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,360
不是说，也许不存在。
Not to say, perhaps, non-existent.

779
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,240
我认为是缺乏刺激。
I think it's lack of excitement.

780
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,440
非常基本的。非常基本的。
Pretty basic. Pretty basic.

781
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
好的。
OK.

782
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,600
努力开发
HARD TAPPING

783
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,520
有人在这里吗?他们咯咯地笑
Somebody here? THEY GIGGLE

784
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,120
我很喜欢蛋白霜的味道。
Really like the nice touch of meringue.

785
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,800
但是，我觉得我的味蕾太油腻了。
However, I think it's very fatty on my palate.

786
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:34,040
就我个人而言，我觉得这一切太甜蜜了。
Personally, I find it all far too sweet.

787
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,040
板球棒，我本可以看到更多的
The cricket bat, I could have seen perhaps a little bit more

788
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,240
用的是白糖，
white sugar had been used,

789
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,560
这会让它更突出一些。
which would have made it stand out a little bit more.

790
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,960
颜色太单一了。
It's all a bit too much one colour.

791
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,440
总的来说，我觉得这里有点不整洁。
As a whole, I think it's a little bit untidy.

792
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,480
你没有给蛋糕完全上釉。
Mm. You did not glaze the cake completely.

793
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:10,520
是的。
Yeah.

794
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:16,280
海绵在哪里?你有一个元素海绵，是吗?
Where is the sponge? You have an element sponge, haven't you?

795
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,120
我们没有把它放进去。
We didn't put it in there.

796
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
真可惜。蛋白霜怎么了?
What a shame. So, what happened to the meringue?

797
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,640
呃…我们只是…我们把它留在烤箱里了。
Er...we just...we left it in the oven.

798
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,480
没有蛋白霜，没有口感，
It's missing the meringue, it's missing texture,

799
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,120
不过，味道还不错。
though, the flavour, actually, quite nice.

800
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:34,680
厨师们，谢谢你们。太好了。谢谢你！
Chefs, thank you. Excellent. Thank you.

801
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,320
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

802
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:38,360
我来承担责任。不，当然不是。
I'll take the blame. No, of course not.

803
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,760
哦,当然。
Oh, definitely.

804
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,840
Benoit和珍惜现在将对两支球队在这两项挑战中的表现进行排名。
Benoit and Cherish will now rank the teams' performances across both challenges.

805
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,320
最后一名的队伍将不得不退出比赛。
The team in last place will have to leave the competition.

806
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,240
我们有个计划。
Well, we had a plan.

807
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:58,800
它并没有像我们预期的那样起作用。
It didn't work exactly what we expect.

808
00:43:58,840 --> 00:44:03,000
味道很好，但他们忘记了菜里的两个元素。
The flavour was good, but they forgotten two element in their dish.

809
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,360
格雷厄姆和迪恩，他们犯了不少错误。
Graham and Dean, they've made quite a few mistakes.

810
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,960
我觉得我失去了理智，真的。我刚丢了……
I think I just lost the edge, really. I just lost...

811
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,880
我不知道。没事的，伙计。
I don't know. Eh, it's all right, buddy.

812
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,840
是的。你知道，只是其中一个…无论如何，我们是一个团队，一如既往。
Yeah. You know, just one of those... Anything, ever, we're a team, as always.

813
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,360
Benoit和珍惜已经做出了决定。
Benoit and Cherish have made their decision.

00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:32,760

低声说谈话
MURMURED CONVERSATION

I'm gutted to be going out. Course I am. But, I mean, to be fair,

我认为他们都应该留在那里。

只要我们能在一起，我们明年再来。

It's not off! It's not off, but just for tonight, it's off!

下一集，剩下的五支队伍……

银石的男孩，格雷厄姆和迪恩，

挣扎着进入状态……
struggled to get into gear...

16
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,920
还不如直接扔进垃圾桶。
Might as well just throw it in the bin.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,760
. .但是来自The Clink的Mustafa和Kevin缺少点睛之笔。
..but Mustafa and Kevin from The Clink lacked the finishing touch.

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,360

So, what happened to the meringue? We left it in the oven.

19
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,320
我很想出去，但公平地说，
I'm gutted to be going out, but to be fair,

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,960
我认为他们都应该留在那里。
I think they all deserve to stay there.

21
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,720
本周……它们不好，它们被压扁了!
This week... They are not fine, they're squashed!

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,080
. .他们必须掌握多层微缩模型……

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,960
没有太大的风险……他们无处可藏。

28
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,560

138
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,680
只是烤得不够熟，
Just a fraction under-baked,

139
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,080
它的质地也不会和异国的水果馅形成对比。
and its texture won't contrast with the exotic fruit fillings.

140
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,680
稠度看起来不错。
The consistency looks all right.

141
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,440
稍微多一点，就不能滚了。
A fraction over and it will be impossible to roll.

142
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,240
别担心，我会在那里的。好吧!
# Don't worry, I'll be there... All right!

143
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,320
每一件小事都会好起来的。＃
# Every little thing are going to be all right. #

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:00,120
我们希望你在节目结束时也能唱这首歌!
We hope you are going to sing this at the end of the show as well!

145
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,440
但萨沃伊的艾迪和马希德已经放弃了自己
But the Savoy's Eddie and Mashid have given themselves

146
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,080
更让人担心的是。你打算怎么把它卷起来?
even more to worry about. How are you going to roll it up?

147
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
我们把它摊开，然后把每一片分开切，
We spread it and then we cut each slice individually,

148
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,920
然后像这样把它们卷起来，这样就能确保
and then we roll them like that, just so we can ensure

149
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
每一块都卷得很好。
that each piece is perfectly rolled.

150
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,400
每一个都必须是相同的。
Each one has to be identical.

151
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:17,560
会好的，主厨。看起来你很自信。
It will be, chef. Looks like you are very confident.

152
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,920
没有恐慌。
There's no panic.

153
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,680
伊朗出生的Mashid的自信让她放弃了13年的职业生涯
Iranian-born Mashid's confidence saw her give up a 13-year career

154
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,240
去追求她对糕点的热爱。
at the Foreign Office to pursue her passion for pastry.

155
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,560
仅仅四年后，
Just four years later,

156
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,680
她正在为伦敦的五星级酒店Savoy完善甜点。
she's perfecting desserts for London's 5-star Savoy.

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
老实说，我希望我能早点这么做。
I wish I had done it sooner, to be quite honest.

158
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,040
我非常喜欢它。
I love it so much.

159
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:37,040
她的玻璃卷将以芒果酥为特色，
Her glazed roulades will feature mango confit,

160
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,760
椰子白巧克力甘纳许
coconut white chocolate ganache

161
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
还有百香果糖浆，
and passion fruit syrup,

162
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:44,160
她会用它来浸泡无脂维也纳海绵。
which she'll use to soak her strips of fatless Viennese sponge.

163
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,520
海绵卷很薄，几分钟就能烤好。
Roulade sponges are so thin they bake in only a few minutes.

164
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,520
哔哔声!哔哔声……
BLEEP! BLEEP...

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,280
犯错的余地很小。
The margin for error is tiny.

166
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,640
快，快，快。只要30秒就能摧毁整个团队
Quick, quick, quick. Just 30 seconds could destroy the team's

167
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,640
前景在这第一个挑战。
prospects in this first challenge.

168
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,760
美丽。哦，闻起来真香!
Beautiful. Oh, the smell is really nice!

169
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,160
我对这个造型很满意。
I'm very happy for the look.

170
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,360
有多长时间?八分钟。
How long was it? Eight minutes.

171
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,160
是的。如果你把它放在托盘上太久，
Yeah. If you leave it on the tray too long,

172
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,320
然后它就会变脆，你就不能卷了。
then it will crisp up and then you can't roll it.

173
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,840
我要把衣服放在上面。
I'm going to place the cloths on top.

174
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,360
在我把它们卷起来之前，它会让它们保持柔软。
It will maintain them soft until I roll them up.

175
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
我觉得它们看起来很棒。漂亮、鲜艳的颜色。
I think they look great. Nice, vibrant colour.

176
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,960
颜色是凯莉和凯蒂最不担心的。
Colour is the least of Kelly and Katie's worries.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,120
我要倒霉了。
I'm having a disaster.

178
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,160
把一切都告诉我。
Tell me all about it.

179
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,320
是在你的个人生活中还是在蛋糕上?
Is it in your personal life or is it with the cakes?

180
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,680
我两方面都很好。她笑着说
I'm good for both. SHE LAUGHS

181
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,040
是蛋糕。
It is the cake.

182
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,760
我的海绵有点粘稠，所以没有煮好，
My sponge is a little bit dense and therefore didn't cook properly,

183
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:37,160
所以我真的很伤心，但我没有时间重拍，
so I'm absolutely gutted, but I don't have time to remake,

184
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,680
但我只能随波逐流
but I've just got to go with it.

185
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,480
我是说，好像他们从来没有注意到那样的事情。从来没有!
I mean, it's not like they ever notice things like that. Never!

186
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,760
她笑着说
SHE LAUGHS

187
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,040
所以，祈祷吧。
So, fingers crossed.

188
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,040
大厨们，你们已经完成一半了。
Chefs, you are halfway through.

189
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,280
这个分层的微型挑战将变得更加困难。
This layered miniature challenge is about to get much harder.

190
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,400
团队还得送出伯努瓦的歌剧切片。
The teams still have to deliver Benoit's opera slice.

191
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,480
歌剧会出很多问题。
A lot can go wrong with an opera.

192
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,560
蛋糕的层次感完美无瑕
The gateau's immaculately neat layers

193
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,520
据说和大阶梯很像吗
are said to resemble the grand tiers

194
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,640
在令人惊叹的巴黎歌剧院里。
inside the stunning Paris opera house.

195
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,280
我选择这个挑战是因为，首先，我喜欢它。
I have picked this challenge because, first, I like it.

196
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,520
这只是一种享受。
It's just a treat to eat.

197
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,000
从技术上讲，它显示了你的分层技巧。
Technically, it shows your master skills of layering.

198
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,840
你从海绵开始，它必须是joconde。
You start with the sponge, it has to be joconde.

199
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,240
joconde的关键是杏仁成分。
The key with the joconde is the almond element.

200
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,920
所以，你需要让混合物均匀均匀地涂抹，
So, you need to have a perfect even spread of the mixture,

201
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,000
然后在被浓咖啡浸泡之前完美烘焙。
and then baked perfectly before it gets soaked with very strong coffee.

202
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,680
奶油奶油，更多的joconde…
Buttercream, more joconde...

203
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,360
. .甘纳许进来了，优雅，丝质，
..and the ganache comes in - elegant, silk,

204
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,440
再来一个joconde，更多的奶油，上釉，切，
another joconde, more buttercream, you glaze, you cut,

205
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:46,680
最后，在每一片面包上整齐地刻上“歌剧”二字。
and finish with the word "opera" neatly inscribed on every slice.

206
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,960
伯努瓦期待着这部经典的完全忠实的再现。
Benoit is expecting a totally faithful recreation of this classic.

207
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,520
但这是一个冒险的计划…
But as well as a risky plan for rolling their roulade...

208
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,480
趁它还没凝固，把它们全割了。不要担心把它放在托盘上。
Cut them all now before it sets. Don't worry about putting it on the tray.

209
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,600
我得把它放在托盘上。
I have to put it on the tray.

210
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,240
但之后你可以把它放回冰箱里，对吧?不…
But then you can put it back in the freezer after, can't you? No...

211
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,880
是的，你可以。不。是的。
Yes, you can. No. Yes.

212
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,920
艾迪和马什德又在歌剧院赌了一把
Eddie and Mashid are taking another gamble with the opera's

213
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
Hallmark joconde海绵。
hallmark joconde sponge.

214
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,560
我们要做无谷蛋白约康德。
So, we're going to do a gluten-free joconde.

215
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:13,960
好的。我们觉得它给了我们更多的质感，
OK. We feel that it gives us a little more texture to work with,

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,960
再多一点……弹性、灵活性?
a little more of a... Elasticity, flexibility?

217
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,880
是的，或多或少。好的。这很有趣。
Yeah, more or less. OK. That's interesting.

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,880
我们可以把食谱用电子邮件发给你。好的!
We can e-mail you the recipe. OK!

219
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,240
还有文字，你打算在什么颜色上写歌剧词?
And the writing, what colour are you going to write the opera word on?

220
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,520
黑巧克力。黑巧克力!
Dark chocolate. Dark chocolate!

221
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,680
应该是这样的。
As it should be.

222
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,360
我以为是白巧克力?
I thought it was white chocolate?

223
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,400
你想错了。
You think wrong.

224
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,000
而萨沃伊人是无谷蛋白的…
While the Savoy go gluten-free...

225
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,920
这个碗可能太小了一点。
This bowl is maybe a bit too small.

226
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,480
. .在皇家咖啡厅酒店
..over at the Hotel Cafe Royal,

227
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,720
他们不小心剪掉了一个至关重要的歌剧部分。
they have accidentally cut out a crucial opera component.

228
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,520
我们没有好好读案情摘要。
We didn't read the brief properly.

229
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,600
评委们期待的是joconde海绵蛋糕，杏仁味更浓，
The judges will be expecting a joconde sponge, where it's more almond-y,

230
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,040
我们用的海绵更柔软。
and the sponge we've got is more spongy.

231
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,320
我们没有时间再做一个了。
We don't have any time to make another one.

232
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,760
他们要说的话让我很紧张。
It's making me really nervous what they're going to say.

233
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,080
我为法国人感到抱歉，如果他们再看我一眼的话。
I'm sorry for French people, if they are looking at me again.

234
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,160
人……人们现在可能只想杀了我!
People... People may just want to kill me now!

235
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:11,000
这只是歌剧的一个层次。
This is just one of the layers in the opera.

236
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,200
我得让他们扯平。
I've got to make them even.

237
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,720
如果连一圈都没有，
If it's not even all the way round,

238
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,000
它的一半会变成饼干，然后我们就会深陷其中。
half of it will turn out like a biscuit and then we're going to be deep in it.

239
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,600
准备好了。
Ready to go in.

240
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,360
歌剧海绵的烘烤时间将直接影响其整洁程度
The baking time for an opera sponge will directly affect how neatly

241
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,840
完成的蛋糕可以切片。
the finished cake can be sliced.

242
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,640
如果烤得太硬，在切的时候
If over-baked and tough, during cutting

243
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,640
填充物会被迫渗出来。
the fillings will be forced to ooze out.

244
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,360
如果未烘烤，一旦被咖啡糖浆浸透，
If under-baked, once soaked with the coffee syrup,

245
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,560
这些层将会瓦解。
the layers will disintegrate.

246
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,960
我们用的是浓缩咖啡，所以味道很浓。
We're using an espresso, so it is very intense.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,520
这就是歌剧蛋糕的精髓，当你吃它的时候，
That's the idea with the opera cake is that as you eat it,

248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,600
它应该像咖啡一样。
it should be like coffee.

249
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,840
尽管他把喜欢的新鲜菠萝放进了面包卷，
Despite bringing his love of fresh pineapple to his roulade,

250
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:49,600
说到格雷厄姆的歌剧，他的咖啡一点也不新鲜。
when it comes to Graham's opera, his coffee is far from fresh.

251
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,920
我们用的是露营咖啡。
We're using a Camp Coffee.

252
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,520
这是咖啡香精，里面有菊苣。
It's coffee essence with chicory in it.

253
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,680
我们用营地咖啡，因为我挺喜欢的。
We use the Camp Coffee because I kind of like it.

254
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,920
但我们要一杯浓缩咖啡，如果你要做的话。
But we'll have an espresso, if you're making.

255
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,400
已经在努力实现雄心勃勃的日本之行了…
Already struggling to pull off an ambitious Japanese roulade...

256
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
不要冒太大的风险。
Not too much risk.

257
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,840
. .WI烹饪学校的咖啡风味来源更多一点
..the WI cookery school's source of coffee flavour is a little more

258
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:09,400
脚踏实地。我们用速溶咖啡。
down-to-earth. We're using instant coffee.

259
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,360
不是每个人都有浓缩咖啡机，
Not everybody has espresso machines,

260
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,400
所以我更喜欢速溶咖啡，因为它很容易买到。
so I prefer instant coffee because it's easily accessible.

261
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,920
看上去不错。看上去不错。
Looking good. Looking good.

262
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:21,280
时间很短，他们的歌剧片一凉，
With time short, the moment their opera slices are cool,

263
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,840
队伍需要开始浸泡和分层。
the teams need to start soaking and layering.

264
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,520
Joconde、奶油乳酪、
Joconde, buttercream,

265
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,360
joconde,巧克力酱,
joconde, ganache,

266
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,200
乔康得，奶油，乔康得。
joconde, buttercream, joconde.

267
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,080
不…忘了我说的最后一句话吧。
No... Forget the last thing I said.

268
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:35,760
Joconde海绵非常干燥，它可以吸收大量的水分，
Joconde sponge is very dry and it can absorb a lot of moisture,

269
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,600
所以我总是对玛丽亚说:“把它弄得像个湖区。”
so I am always telling to Maria, "Make it like a Lake District."

270
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:40,240
湖区!
Lake District!

271
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,520
只是想确保所有地方都浸透了。
Just want to make sure it's well-soaked everywhere.

272
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,640
这是咖啡奶油。确保它是均匀的。
This is the coffee buttercream. Making sure it's nice and even.

273
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,760
它们都要一样，都要完美。
They need to be all the same, all perfect.

274
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,680
但为了追求完美的层次感
But in pursuit of perfect layers,

275
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,760
艾迪和马什德要走另一条复杂的路线。
Eddie and Mashid are taking yet another complicated route.

276
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,720
我们要开始把我们的房子建反了。
We're going to start building ours upside down.

277
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,400
我们还剩多久?大厨们，你们有30分钟。
How long we got left? Chefs, you have 30 minutes.

278
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,920
利亚姆，有点不对劲。
Liam, something's not right.

279
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,720
谢谢你！大厨们，你们还有30分钟!
Thank you. Chefs, you have 30 minutes left!

280
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,400
你有30分钟。
You've got 30 minutes.

281
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,440
这样好多了。
That's much better.

282
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,880
开始滚动海绵。
Going to start rolling the sponge.

283
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,080
希望它能保持得很好。
It's going to hopefully hold itself well.

284
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,200
我要把每一个都单独滚动。
I'm going to roll each one individually.

285
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,160
它显示了一种不同的技能。
It shows a different skill.

286
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,800
我不想像其他人一样。
I didn't want to be like everyone else.

287
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,720
应该没问题。
It should be OK.

288
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:38,760
现在我只需要挤一下，让它有层次感，甚至。
I just need to squeeze now to have good layers, and even.

289
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,240
先把面包卷拿来，伙计。
Just get these rolls first, mate.

290
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,440
坚持下去。它要散架了，伙计。
Hang on. It's coming apart, mate.

291
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,720
哦，看在上帝的份上!
Oh, for BLEEP sake!

292
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,960
不裂缝。不裂缝。不裂缝。
Don't crack. Don't crack. Don't crack.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,880
我们要把菠萝卷紧。
We are going to get on the pineapple with it rolled up tight.

294
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,600
希望它能保持原来的形状。
Hopefully, it will hold its shape.

295
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,040
我正在为这出歌剧上釉。
I am doing the dark glaze for the opera.

296
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,120
埃迪，你现在要上釉吗?
Are going to glaze that now, Eddie?

297
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,240
不，已经上过釉了。我们把自己的房子建反了。
No, it's already glazed. We built ours upside down.

298
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,760
你把它建反了，就像一场歌剧!
You built it upside down, like a tarte tatin of opera!

299
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,680
你打算在下面放什么?我们要放巧克力之类的东西。
What you going to put underneath? We're going to put, like, chocolate.

300
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
这叫长龙。联合国chablon !
It's called a chablon. Un chablon!

301
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,360
抱歉，我要离开你一会儿。
Sorry, I'm just going to run away from you for a second.

302
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
每次我跟男人说话，他们都会跑掉。
It's what happens every time I talk to a man - they run off.

303
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,920
我在涂一些金粉，让它看起来更优雅。
I'm applying some gold powder, make it more elegant.

304
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,720
切断它可能是非常关键的。
Cutting it can be very crucial.

305
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:34,680
我希望我们有足够的时间。
I hope we're going to have enough time.

306
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:38,440
我唯一担心的是图层，
The only thing that I'm really worried about is the layers,

307
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,880
他们都是一样的。这就是那个时刻。
having them all identical. This is that moment.

308
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,000
真的屏住呼吸。
Literally holding my breath.

309
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,120
歌剧的结果很好。
Opera's coming out really well.

310
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,720
看起来很不错。甚至非常。
Looks very good. Very even.

311
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,920
釉是流动的，如BLEEP。
Glaze is runny as BLEEP.

312
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,160
写，写，写……
Writing, writing, write...

313
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
有些压力。
Bit stressed.

314
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,640
我只是在做巧克力叶来装饰卷。
I'm just making the chocolate leaves to decorate the roulade.

315
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,600
它刚出来。
It's just coming out.

316
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,360
因为这里太热了，我的意式奶冻都开始化了。
Cos it's so warm in here, my panna cotta's started to melt.

317
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,440
所以，今天还没有完全解决。
So, it's not quite worked out today.

318
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,160
房间里太热了，奶油都要融化了。
The room is so hot, it's, like, melting all the cream.

319
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,160
没事的，马什德，把它们放进冰箱就行了。
It's fine, Mashid, just put them in the freezer.

320
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,280
五分钟，大厨们。
Five minutes, chefs.

321
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,680
当你开心的时候，时间过得很快。
Time flies when you're having fun.

322
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,680
当你不在的时候。
And when you're not.

323
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,560
只是现在有点发抖……
Just got a bit of the shakes at the moment...

324
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,080
我只是想尽快完成。
Just trying to do it as quick as I can.

325
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,720
这是下降!哔哔声!
It's fallen! BLEEP!

326
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,440
它掉下来了?哔哔声!
It fell down? BLEEP!

327
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,440
不，听着，没事的。这可不好!马希德，马希德，冷静。
No, look, it's OK. It's not OK! Mashid, Mashid, calm down.

328
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,440
艾迪掉了一个托盘在马什德的卷饼上。
Eddie's dropped a tray on a batch of Mashid's roulades.

329
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,640
冷静点，拉希德。没关系。
Calm down, Rashid. It's OK.

330
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,160
看。他们很好。
Look. They're fine.

331
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
他们并不好。
They are not fine.

332
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
它们被压扁了。
They are squashed.

333
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,320
它根本就不是固定的。
It's not set at all.

334
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,040
是啊，在我手里融化了。
Yeah, just melting in my hands.

335
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,040
我可能不得不离开他们。
I might have to leave them.

336
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,800
你确定你不想喷一下吗?
You sure you don't want to try and spray?

337
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,400
至少喷几个。我不打算喷它们。
At least spray a couple. I'm not going to spray them.

338
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,440
不需要。
Don't have to.

339
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,440
我们能搞定的，马希德。我们能行。
We've got this, Mashid. We've got this.

340
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,760
有些压力。
Bit stressed.

341
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
我们要去哪，伙计?
Where we up to, mate?

342
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,960
还剩九个。
Nine to go.

343
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,240
你还有一分钟。
You have one minute left.

344
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,000
接通电源，加糖就行了。
Just power through and put the sugar on.

345
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
加糖。
Get the sugar on.

346
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
绝对没问题。
It's absolutely fine.

347
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,880
完成了!是的!
Finished! Yes!

348
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
绝对的。
Absolutely.

349
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,960
时间到了。
Time is up.

350
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,320
远离你的切片。
Step away from your slices.

351
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
BLEEP说对了。
BLEEP nailed it.

352
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,120
我的第一次很完美，你却把它们给毁了。
My first ones were perfect and you squashed them.

353
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:57,720
破坏。被我自己的队友破坏了!
Sabotage. Sabotaged by my own team member!

354
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,840
我很抱歉。我不知道它会这么做。
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was going to do that.

355
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:06,720
现在是判断分层微缩模型的时候了。
It's judgment time for the layered miniatures.

356
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:09,480
她叹了口气，哼着歌
SHE SIGHS AND HUMS

357
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,000
萨沃伊号，请过来。
The Savoy, please come forward.

358
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,200
它们看起来很均匀，非常接近我所希望的
They look pretty even and really close to what I would have hoped an

359
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,920
歌剧的样子。当我举起你的蛋糕，
opera to look like. When I lift up your cake,

360
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,680
你在底部放了一层巧克力。
you actually put a layer of chocolate right on the bottom.

361
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,480
这样做也是非常专业的。
It's very professional to do that as well.

362
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,520
好的。
OK.

363
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
毫米。
Mm.

364
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,760
无面粉海绵。
Flourless sponge.

365
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,680
是的。Well-soaked。
Yes. Well-soaked.

366
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,760
我很喜欢你的奶油和你的
And I really enjoyed the balance between your buttercream and your

367
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:52,240
巧克力酱。我已经尝到了歌剧的味道。
ganache. I've got all the flavour of the opera.

368
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,280
如果你真的写得很好，
If you would have actually nailed the writing,

369
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,280
你会吃到很好吃的。做得很好。
you would have had a very nice slice. Well done.

370
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:02,200
看着这张卷饼，我希望能有更多的技巧。
Looking at the roulade, I was hoping that there's more finesse.

371
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,040
嗯嗯。釉在哪里?我们出去的时候出了点小问题
Mm-hm. Where's the glaze? We had a slight issue when we were taking out

372
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,280
做卷的海绵。
the sponges for the roulade.

373
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,720
釉已经准备好了，但是我们没时间了。
The glaze was ready but it was just, we ran out of time.

374
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,240
也没时间了。不是釉料就是装饰的问题。
Running out of time as well. It was either the glaze or the decoration.

375
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,920
我决定用装饰。
I decided to go with the decoration.

376
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,200
哦，太遗憾了。是啊，真遗憾。
Oh, that's a shame. Yeah, it's a shame.

377
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,440
我很喜欢你的层次感。
I quite like the layering that you put through.

378
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,160
我觉得做得很漂亮。
I think it's very neatly done.

379
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,960
它非常精确，最重要的是，我真的很喜欢吃它。
And it's so precise and, most of all, I really enjoyed eating it.

380
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,600
平衡刚刚好。
The balance was just right.

381
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,520
我觉得味道好极了。
It tastes sensational to me.

382
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,080
做得很好。谢谢你！味道，非常干净，非常整齐。
Well done. Thank you. The flavour profile, very clean, very neat.

383
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,400
你有椰子，芒果和所有这些。
You've got the coconut, you've got mangoes and all that.

384
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:43,880
质地方面，我希望海绵是一个法式蛋糕。
Texture-wise, I would have wished that the sponge was a dacquoise.

385
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:45,280
我不会改变它。
I would not change it.

386
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,040
我不会以任何形式改变它。
I would not change it in any form.

387
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,120
我们要求同存异，对吧?太美了。
We're going to agree to disagree, huh? That is beautiful.

388
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,680
a-mazing。
It's a-mazing.

389
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,160
A-mazing。
A-mazing.

390
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,840
它可能看起来有点像歌剧，但那颗杏仁，
It may look a little bit like an opera, but that almondy,

391
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,280
没有稍微有嚼劲的海绵。
slightly chewy, rich sponge is not there.

392
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,360
看这条面包卷，它们看起来很均匀。
Looking at the roulade, they look quite uniform.

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,240
你的巧克力叶怎么了?
What happened to your chocolate leaves?

394
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
它们并不完美，我们不想戴上它们。
They were not perfect and we didn't want to put them on.

395
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,680
好的。看起来很简单。
OK. It looks very simple.

396
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,600
海绵很有弹性。
The sponge is very elastic.

397
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,840
天气很干燥。
It's very dry.

398
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,600
我对专业厨师的期望更高。
I would expect more from a professional chef.

399
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,880
从视觉上看，这部歌剧的层次很薄。
Visually, the opera has very thin layers.

400
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:51,120
所有的东西都切得整整齐齐，白巧克力也完成了，
Everything is neatly cut and it's finished also with white chocolate,

401
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,760
但是你在上面放了一点金粉。
but you've put a little bit of gold powder on it.

402
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,840
你带来了一个小转折。
You've brought a little twist.

403
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,600
巧克力有点多。
A little too much chocolate.

404
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,920
让它有点甜。
Makes it a little bit sweet.

405
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,120
但我有咖啡的余味，而且海绵泡得很好。
But I've got a coffee aftertaste, and the sponge is well-soaked.

406
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,880
看看这个卷饼，很笨重，还有漩涡，
Looking at the roulade, it's quite heavy-handed, and the swirl as well,

407
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,560
它很不整洁。
it is very untidy.

408
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
有些地方味道不错，
Some parts of it, the taste is nice,

409
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,880
浓郁的柑橘味，充满异国情调。
the zesty, citrus, exotic taste to it.

410
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:27,520
但馅料与海绵的比例不对。
However, the proportion of the filling to the sponge is not right.

411
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:31,760
但我喜欢你海绵里的椰子。谢谢你！
But I like the idea of coconut in your sponge. Thank you.

412
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,880
大厨们，发生什么事了?
Chefs, what happened?

413
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,400
看起来他们好像在呼救。
Look as though they're crying for help.

414
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,760
“救命!”厨房里太暖和了。
"Help!" Just got so warm in this kitchen.

415
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,800
我会说你们选错了食谱，就这样。
I would say you guys chose the wrong recipes, full stop.

416
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,080
其他球队的厨房都是一样的。
The other teams have had the same kitchen.

417
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,560
真遗憾，因为我喜欢粉色海绵的想法。
It's a shame, because I like the idea of the pink sponge.

418
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
它的口感很难吃。
The texture is so unpleasant.

419
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,360
事情不像看上去那么糟。
It's not as bad as it looks.

420
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,280
辣椒，我准备好了，味道并不浓烈。
The chilli, I got, and it's not overpowering.

421
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,000
你用了柠檬草，酸橙，椰子，
You used your lemon grass, you used lime, you used coconut,

422
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,800
然后你也有你的激情。
and then you've got your passion as well.

423
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,240
你想把所有东西都放进去，
You are trying to put everything in,

424
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,400
希望有些事情能让彼此开心。
hoping that some things might be happy with each other.

425
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,320
你的歌剧片看起来很有层次感。
Your opera slice actually look quite nice in terms of the layering.

426
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,680
让我们品味。
Let's taste.

427
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,720
你用的是坎普咖啡?
You used Camp coffee?

428
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,840
嗯嗯。我妈妈在咖啡里加了菊苣。
Mm-hm. My mother used chicory to add into her coffee.

429
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,200
这是一个很好的补充，但是，啊，我没有足够的咖啡。
It's a great addition, but, agh, I haven't got enough coffee.

430
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,160
它需要在某个地方有咖啡。
It needs to be coffee somewhere.

431
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,640
呃…
Er...

432
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:56,240
我离我想要的歌剧还远着呢，伙计们。我很抱歉。
I'm far from the opera I'm looking for, guys. I'm sorry.

433
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,840
我们试着分层。
Well, we've got an attempt at layering.

434
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,040
这些看起来很均匀。
These ones look pretty even.

435
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,840
并不是每个人都是这样。
Not the case for every single one of them.

436
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,160
这大约是3.2。
This about 3.2.

437
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,040
这大约是3.8。
This is about 3.8.

438
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,200
大约5毫米。
About five millimetres.

439
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,200
是的，所以这很不一致。
Yeah, so it's quite inconsistent.

440
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,960
我买了咖啡和巧克力。
I've got the coffee and chocolate.

441
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,520
够香吗?
Is it fragrant enough?

442
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,760
不。我更喜欢烘焙咖啡，
No. I would love a little bit more roasting kind of coffee,

443
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
你的海绵有点干。
and your sponge is slightly dry.

444
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,560
看看这个卷，它可以更精确，我能看出来
Looking at the roulade, it can be more precise and I can see that

445
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,360
事实上，你的奶油会让你的切片变重。
actually your cream, it just weighs down your slice.

446
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,040
这不是我见过最吸引人的卷饼，
It's not the most appealing roulade slice I've ever seen,

447
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,320
我就讲到这里。
and I'll leave it there.

448
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,240
海绵很重。
The sponge is very heavy.

449
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,480
还没煮熟。我想尝尝蛋奶冻苹果。
It's not cooked. I was trying to taste the custard apple.

450
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:15,600
不知何故，它只是迷失在内心。
Somehow, it's just lost inside.

451
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,520
我不会跑着去买那些切片的。
I will not run to buy one of those slices.

452
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,440
从可怕到非常可怕?
On a scale of terrible to really terrible?

453
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,040
糟透了。糟透了。
Terrible. Terrible.

454
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,920
我觉得我让大家失望了，这让我很失望，
I feel like I've let people down, and it's just disappointing for me,

455
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,240
真的。你没有让我失望。
really. You haven't let me down.

456
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,400
我仍然爱你。
I still love you.

457
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040
经历了劳累的第一天，
After a gruelling first day,

458
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:52,680
各队现在有黄金时间准备一场更艰巨的比赛
the teams now have a golden hour to prepare for an even more daunting

459
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,840
挑战，明天的展示。
challenge - tomorrow's showpiece.

460
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:59,600
至于谁在领导，是萨沃伊团队。
In terms of who's leading, it is the Savoy team.

461
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:02,560
你可以看到埃迪真的在逼自己。
And you can see that Eddie really pushes himself.

462
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,960
是的，他很好胜。
Yeah, he is very competitive.

463
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,920
R巧克力，他们似乎工作效率很高。
R Chocolate, they seem to work very efficiently.

464
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,720
他们工作非常干净，而且很有组织。
They work very, very clean and they organise themselves.

465
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
他们甚至有时间打扫厨房。
They even had time to clean the kitchen.

466
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,760
完全正确。非常方便。我是说，令人印象深刻。
Exactly. Very handy. I mean, impressive.

467
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,240
我希望我能那样做。我真的很担心皇家咖啡馆。
I wish I could do that. I'm really worried about Cafe Royale.

468
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,200
他们甚至不会做海绵。
They can't even make a sponge.

469
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,240
但这是年轻人常犯的错误。
But this is the common youngster mistake.

470
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,960
是的。他们没有看简报!
Yeah. They didn't read the brief!

471
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,640
我看到两三支球队在挣扎。
I see two or three teams struggling.

472
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:34,280
我们来自银石的同事，WI。
Our lovely colleagues from Silverstone, the WI.

473
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,840
我认为他们失去了对野心的控制。
I think they lost control of their ambition.

474
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,240
我有信心。我想他们明天会把它砸了。
I've got faith. I think they're going to smash it tomorrow.

475
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:44,360
我们不要低估这是一个不容易的挑战。
Let's not underestimate that this is a challenge which is not easy.

476
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,720
哦，不，伯努瓦。
Oh, no, Benoit.

477
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:48,760
没人想过他们就这么走进去了
No-one was thinking they're going to just be able to have a walk in

478
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,080
明天去公园。
the park tomorrow.

479
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,200
在这五支队伍中有一支必须离开之前，还有一个挑战
One challenge remains before one of these five teams will have to leave

480
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
的竞争。早上好，厨师们。
the competition. Good morning, chefs.

481
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,640
是时候进行你的第二场比赛了。
It's time for your second showpiece challenge of the competition.

482
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:19,120
今天，我们想让你准备一个场合的展示。
Today, we'd like you to prepare an occasion showpiece.

483
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,920
一个人多久会犯一次这样的错误?
How often would one make one of these?

484
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,080
只是偶尔。我明白了。
Just occasionally. I see.

485
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,200
它的灵感来自法国经典的宗教建筑，
It is inspired by the French classic the religieuse,

486
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:32,640
它包括两个泡芙包，里面装满了法式奶油和
which consists of two choux buns filled with creme patissiere and

487
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,480
上面撒上糖釉。
topped with a sugar glaze.

488
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,880
但我们希望你能更新这部经典，把它变成
But we would like you to update this classic and transform it into a

489
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,440
现代的展示品。
modern showpiece.

490
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:47,000
展示品必须展示至少两种美味和特色
The showpiece must showcase at least two delicious flavours and feature

491
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,880
特殊的技术。
exceptional technique.

492
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,480
好了，厨师们。他们必须喂饱24个人
There you have it, chefs. They must feed 24 people,

493
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,800
或者一个非常饥饿的人。
or one very hungry person.

494
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,320
现在，你们今天有四个小时来完成你们的现代宗教，
Now, you have four hours today to complete your modern religieuses,

495
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,840
你的时间从现在开始。
and your time starts now.

496
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,120
准备出发!
Ready to go!

497
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,000
Religieuse是法语中修女的意思，
Religieuse is the French word for nun,

498
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,320
据说这种profprofole类型的甜点就像忠实的信徒
and this profiterole-type dessert is said to resemble the faithful

499
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,920
姐妹们还有两个装饰精美的泡芙包。
sisters with two beautifully decorated choux buns.

500
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:20,080
所以我们在测试他们的能力，让他们把经典变成一个令人惊叹的因素。
So we're testing their abilities to take that classic into a wow factor.

501
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,160
身高、技能。
Height, skills.

502
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,080
它也需要烤得漂亮。
It needs to be baked beautifully as well.

503
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,040
我必须有一个光滑的质地，当我举起来的时候，要有一个好的V形。
I have to have a nice smooth texture to give me a good V when I lift up.

504
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,800
就快到了。我所有的学生都知道什么是flappy V。
It's almost there. All my students know about a flappy V.

505
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,360
呵呵
CHUCKLING

506
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,400
当我咬一口泡芙的时候，它应该很漂亮，
When I bite into the choux, it should be a beautiful,

507
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,040
酥脆的外表和轻盈、通风、柔软的内部，
crispy exterior and a light, airy, pillowy interior,

508
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,520
香味扑鼻而来。
exploding with beautiful flavour.

509
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:52,480
我们现在处于比赛的这个阶段，你负担不起
We are now at this stage of the competition when you cannot afford

510
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:57,120
浪费每一分钟。所以他们必须从一开始就全力以赴
to waste any minute. So they have to crack on from the first minute go

511
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:01,320
确保他们利用每一个可以利用的时间
and make sure they use every available time they've got to

512
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,160
制作一些特别的东西。
produce something special.

513
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
大多数团队都在准备经典的泡芙包
While most teams are preparing classic choux buns...

514
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,200
显然，泡芙面点应该有手绘的管道。
Obviously, choux pastry should have freehand piping.

515
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,200
. .希望能改善昨天混乱的表现，
..hoping to improve on yesterday's chaotic performance,

516
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,760
格雷厄姆发明了一种方法可以保证基地的稳定
Graham has developed a method that could deliver stability for the base

517
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,640
他的宗教信仰。我用了约克郡布丁罐头，因为
of his religieuses. I've used Yorkshire pudding tins because

518
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,240
我只想要一个平坦均匀的龙骨，真的，这样它就不会摇晃，
I just want a flat, even keel, really, so it doesn't, urp,

519
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,800
你明白我的意思吗?它不会拉锯。
you know what I mean? It doesn't seesaw.

520
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,280
他希望完美的泡芙会充满土耳其风味
His hopefully perfect choux will be filled with Turkish

521
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,920
奶油蛋糕和巧克力慕斯，
delight flavoured creme patissiere and chocolate mousse,

522
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,400
他们会坐在一个完全由巧克力制成的展览品下面
and they'll sit beneath a showpiece made entirely of chocolate that's

523
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,720
受到他们最喜欢的运动的启发。
been inspired by their favourite sport.

524
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,360
这是一组轮胎。
It's going to be a group of tyres.

525
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,360
你是说轮胎吗?
Did you say tyres?

526
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:43,040
轮胎。然后我们有一个排气从顶部出来。哇。
Tyres. And then we have an exhaust that comes out the top. Wow.

527
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,320
再加上一点哇，就给你们听。
And a little wow on the top of that, just for you guys.

528
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:48,000
哦。好的，很好，那么……你想哇，
Oh. OK, great, so... You wanted wow,

529
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,080
所以我们要试着给你wow。好的。
so we're going to try and give you wow. OK.

530
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,560
感激,感激。
Appreciated, appreciated.

531
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,240
我看到你用蛋糕罐做泡芙糕点。是的。
I saw you using a cake tin for your choux pastry. Yes.

532
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,320
这让我想起了约克郡布丁。
Well, this reminds me of Yorkshire puddings.

533
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:01,680
是的。我喜欢约克郡布丁。
Yes. I love Yorkshire puddings.

534
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,440
在演示中可能会有一个现代的转折。
There may be a modern twist in the presentation.

535
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,280
斯拉夫和玛丽亚也在用巧克力制作他们的展示品，
Slav and Maria are also creating their showpiece from chocolate,

536
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,720
但他们的作品可能更符合宗教主题。
but theirs is perhaps more in keeping with the religieuse theme.

537
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,960
玛丽亚现在正在做一本圣经书。
Maria at the moment is making a Bible book.

538
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,200
噢,是吗?圣经书?
Oh, yeah? A Bible book?

539
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,600
是的。巧克力圣经?
Yes. A chocolate Bible book?

540
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,400
是的。你觉得这是第一本巧克力圣经吗?
Yes. Do you think this is the first chocolate Bible book ever?

541
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,440
他们的巧克力圣经将被经典的宗教信仰包围，
Their chocolate Bible will be surrounded by classic religieuses,

542
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,040
夹心巧克力奶油和榛子果仁，
filled with chocolate creme patissiere and hazelnut praline,

543
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,560
在它们之上耸立着一个巧克力装饰的教堂尖顶
and towering above them all will be a chocolate church spire decorated

544
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,200
配上蜡烛、白巧克力玫瑰和回火巧克力叶。
with candles, white chocolate roses and tempered chocolate leaves.

545
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,960
你能吃叶子吗?
Can you eat the leaf?

546
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,320
不是树叶。但大概一天五次，对吧?
Not the leaf. But it's like five a day, innit?

547
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,560
笑声
LAUGHTER

548
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,120
这可能不是你今天最好的沙拉选择。
It might not be your best salad choice for today.

549
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:50,920
可能是吧。
Could be.

550
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,920
Leanne和Romain也会用巧克力做建筑。
Leanne and Romain will also be building with chocolate.

551
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:58,560
我们要做一个巧克力黑森林主题的展示品。
We're making a chocolate Black Forest-themed showpiece.

552
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,280
但是，在用海绵瑞士卷做的卷饼失败后……
But, after a failed roulade made with Swiss roll sponge...

553
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,080
我们对巧克力工作更有信心。
We're more confident with chocolate work.

554
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,880
. .一场没有jaconde的歌剧
..and an opera without a jaconde,

555
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:07,960
他们现在正在计划一个没有泡芙的宗教仪式。
they're now planning a religieuse without a choux.

556
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,920
我看到你铸造了很多球体。
I saw that you mould a lot of spheres.

557
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
那是干什么用的?使它现代化。
What is that for? To modernise it.

558
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,160
我们要做巧克力底。
We're having a chocolate base.

559
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,000
你以前在法国见过宗教吗?
You've seen religieuses before, in France?

560
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,760
我知道。一个大泡芙，一个小泡芙。
I know. It's a big choux and a small choux.

561
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,120
所以底料是泡芙还是不是泡芙?
So the base is a choux or it's not a choux?

562
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,680
不，底座是半个黑巧克力球。
No, the base is half a sphere of dark chocolate.

563
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,080
哦。因为你想要现代的，所以我不想…
Oh. Because you wanted it modern, so I didn't want to be...

564
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,600
好的。泡芙够了吗?
OK. Is that going to be enough choux?

565
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880
我想是的。
I think so.

566
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,760
他们的半巧克力球基地将容纳黑巧克力外交官
Their half chocolate sphere bases will hold dark chocolate diplomat

567
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,240
奶油中加入酸樱桃。

568
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:40,480
他们的泡芙顶部会填上樱桃外交官奶油。
Their choux topping will be filled with a Kirsch diplomat cream.

569
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,160
这些现代宗教将居住在以黑森林为代表的地方
And these modern religieuses will inhabit a Black Forest represented

570
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,160
在一棵华丽的巧克力树旁。
by an ornate chocolate tree.

571
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,720
我总是很关心你
I'm always concerned with you,

572
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:50,360
你给自己施加了多少压力……
how much you are putting yourself under pressure...

573
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,760
我们很好。你真的有时间完成吗?
We're fine. Will you have the time to actually finish?

574
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,720
让我们开始吧。我们要去泡芙。
Let's choux off. We're going to choux off.

575
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,560
祝你好运。看到的。
Good luck. See.

576
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,880
再见。
Bye.

577
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,160
当三支队伍向巧克力之神祈祷时……
While three teams pray to the gods of chocolate...

578
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:07,200
毅力，耐心，都是我没有的品质。
Perseverance, patience, all the traits I haven't got.

579
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,720
. .为了展示他们的作品，
..for their showpieces,

580
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:13,400
WI烹饪学校和萨沃伊人将他们的信仰放在了神圣的地方
the WI Cookery School and the Savoy are putting their faith in the holy

581
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,080
三位一体的烤杏仁，糖和更多的糖。
trinity of toasted almonds, sugar and even more sugar.

582
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,720
我们的展品是用牛轧糖做的，这是一种焦糖。
Our showpiece is made out of nougatine, which is a caramel.

583
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,440
传统上，你会把它放在牛轧巧克力片上。
Traditionally, you would serve it on a nougatine piece.

584
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:27,240
萨沃伊华丽的三层牛轧巧克力展示架将会
The Savoy's ornate, triple-tiered nougatine display stand will be

585
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,520
上面点缀着优雅的白巧克力。
topped with elegant strands of white chocolate.

586
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,560
他们的宗教信仰会被焦糖奶油和柚子豆腐填满，
Their religieuses will be filled with caramel cremeux and yuzu curd,

587
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,960
用榛子泥和透明糖来装饰
and will be decorated with hazelnut puree hair and transparent sugar

588
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,400
工作的帽子。牛轧糖不是一种很
work hats. The nougatine is not something that gets made very

589
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:47,840
现在有很多，所以我们想试一试，再逼自己一把。
much nowadays, so we want to give it a go and push ourselves a bit more.

590
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:51,880
凯利和凯蒂将传统的牛轧糖推向了新的高度。
Kelly and Katie are pushing the traditional nougatine even further.

591
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,400
所以我做了很多婚礼蛋糕和庆祝蛋糕，
So I do a lot of wedding cakes and celebration cakes,

592
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,800
但婚礼蛋糕绝对是我最喜欢做的事情。
but wedding cakes are definitely my favourite thing to do.

593
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,240
我很喜欢传统的堆叠的样子，所以我们要把它堆叠起来。
I do like that traditional stacked look, so we're going to stack it up.

594
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:02,800
我想我们会有四层。
I think we're going to have four tiers.

595
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,920
为了留在竞争中，他们将看到传统的牛轧糖
Their bid to stay in the competition will see a traditional nougatine

596
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,960
塔上堆满了樱桃、巧克力和樱桃饼，
tower piled with cherry, chocolate and Kirsch-filled religieuses,

597
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,680
但在不太传统的煎饼或甜甜圈上，
but topped with a less than traditional beignet, or doughnut,

598
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,040
由乳清干酪和龙蒿制成。
made with ricotta and tarragon.

599
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,880
昨天，你在舞会上的表现很糟糕
Yesterday, you had a pretty disastrous attempt at the roulade

600
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,840
因为你用的是奇怪的味道。
because you were using kind of odd flavours.

601
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,600
嗯嗯。今天你带来了龙蒿。
Mm-hm. And today you bring tarragon.

602
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,880
是的。有点像大料的味道，对吧?
Yes. It's kind of like an aniseed taste, isn't it?

603
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,880
它是。是的。一切都是关于平衡。
It is. Yes. It's all about balance.

604
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,280
你们要保持平衡
You guys nail the balance,

605
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,640
你有一些潜在的非凡之处。
you've got something which potentially is extraordinary.

606
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,720
大厨们，你们已经完成一半了。
Chefs, you are halfway through.

607
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,480
小心点。还有两个小时。
Watch your backs. Two hours left.

608
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,280
这是热焦糖，170度以上。
This is hot caramel, so 170, above 170 degrees.

609
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,520
超级热。牛轧糖的温度是170度，
Super hot. Nougatine cooks at 170 degrees and,

610
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,680
除非是刚出炉的…
unless it's worked straight from the oven...

611
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,160
嗷，嗷，嗷。
Ow, ow, ow.

612
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,560
. .它不可能被切割或塑形。
..it's impossible to cut or shape.

613
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,080
我戴着手套。
I'm wearing the gloves.

614
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,000
你耍流氓了，是吗?我不听话了。你要小心。
You've gone rogue, haven't you? I've gone rogue. You be careful.

615
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,160
不，不，不。我的头发断裂了。
No, no, no, no. I've got breakage.

616
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
牛轧糖，它只是不太适合打球。
Nougatine, it's just not quite playing ball.

617
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,720
哦，那就像……噢!
Oh, that's like... Ow!

618
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,880
哦,哔哔声。
Oh, BLEEP.

619
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,160
凯蒂亲手摸过融化的焦糖。
Katie's touched molten caramel with her bare hand.

620
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,160
真是个白痴。对不起,凯利。
What an idiot. Sorry, Kelly.

621
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,640
没关系，别担心。
It's all right, don't worry.

622
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,720
像往常一样，我们在练习时做得很完美，但在那天…
As per usual, perfect when we did it in practice, but on the day...

623
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,880
燃烧自己永远不会有帮助。
Burning yourself never helps.

624
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,800
凯利现在要靠自己打造他们的样板。
Kelly now faces building their showpiece on her own.

625
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,680
哔哔声。疼吗?有点刺痛，是吗?
BLEEP. Is that hurting? Stinging a little bit, is it?

626
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,840
我不会再做焦糖了。
I am not doing any more caramel.

627
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,040
我就把它留在这里。是的。
So, I'll leave that there for you. Yeah.

628
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,040
她烧伤的手无法继续制作牛轧糖，
Unable to continue nougatine construction with her burnt hand,

629
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,040
凯蒂现在需要把她所有的注意力集中在宗教上。
Katie now needs to focus all of her attention on the religieuse.

630
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,760
正确的。管。
Right. Tube.

631
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,640
填满吗?是的,请。
Fill? Yes, please.

632
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,160
大厨们，你们还有一个小时!你还有一个小时!
Chefs, you've got an hour left! You got one hour left!

633
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,600
我伤害了。
I hurt.

634
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,440
评委要求的是形状完美，酥脆，
The judges have demanded perfectly formed, crisp,

635
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,440
好馅，泡芙包。
well filled, choux buns.

636
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,600
确保它们都被填满了，所有的。
Make sure they're filled, all of them.

637
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,560
是的。不要错过任何一个。
Yes. Don't miss any.

638
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,720
这是一个团队无法完成的任务。
Something that one team aren't quite ready to deliver.

639
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,680
嗯…有些有点平。
Um... Some of them are a bit flat.

640
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:27,680
说真的，它看起来确实像约克郡布丁!
Seriously, it does look like a Yorkshire pudding!

641
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,840
这可能是他们想要应用的设计的一部分，但这是真的。
It may be part of the design they want to apply, but it's true.

642
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,400
看起来有点奇怪。
It looks a little bit strange.

643
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,080
我想我来管它，伙计。
I think I'll pipe it, mate.

644
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,560
格雷厄姆决定把泡芙作为他的宗教基地
Graham's decided to start the choux for the base of his religieuse

645
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,320
再来一遍。
all over again.

646
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,360
他们有麻烦了。还有土耳其软糖，是玫瑰味的。
They are in trouble. And then they have Turkish delight, which is rose.

647
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,160
我希望他们不会给我一块肥皂。
I hope they're not going to give me a bar of soap.

648
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,920
只需要20分钟就能做好。
It'll only take 20 minutes to cook.

649
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,920
他们不出来了，我不想打他们太多
They're not coming out, and I don't want to bang them too much

650
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,320
因为我不想打散它们。
cos I don't want to shatter them.

651
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,200
咖啡馆皇家。那天他只吃一个泡芙包。
Cafe Royale. He will have only one choux bun on that religieuse.

652
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,600
底座是一个巧克力外壳。
The base will be a chocolate shell.

653
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,360
我希望它不会太重。
I hope it's not going to be too heavy.

654
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,040
我们要把它冷冻起来。
We're going to blast freeze that one.

655
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,600
尝不出焦糖的味道。
Can't taste the caramel.

656
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:13,440
萨沃伊。做……你可能认为他们遥遥领先，
The Savoy. Do... You could think they are comfortably ahead,

657
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,400
在昨天的挑战之后。
after yesterday's challenge.

658
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,240
但他们在冒险，他们在用牛轧糖。
But they're taking risks, they're working with nougatine.

659
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,680
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

660
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:22,760
R巧克力。他们已经在修建宗教建筑了。
R Chocolate. They are building the religieuse already.

661
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,000
他们非常有条理。
They are super organised.

662
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,400
它们看起来很漂亮。
They look beautiful.

663
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,880
这是我们的包。
So this is our beignet.

664
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,880
这是白干酪、香草、龙蒿、
So, this is a mixture of cottage cheese, vanilla, tarragon,

665
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,040
还有泡芙糕点。

666
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,480
WI。龙蒿吗?
The WI. Tarragon?

667
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,080
意大利乳清干酪吗?和巧克力?

00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,640
或者炸鱼薯条?哦啦，哦啦，哦啦。
And maybe fish and chip? Oh la, oh la, oh la.

669
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,040
还有45分钟就能确保在比赛中获得一席之地了。
45 minutes left to secure a place in the competition.

670
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,160
她想要一模一样的，不是吗?
She wants them identical, doesn't she?

671
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,200
不坏。
Not bad.

672
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
我太高兴了。
I'm so happy.

673
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,880
随着时间的流逝，
And with time running out,

674
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:55,720
还有24个精致的宗教用途需要填充和装饰……
there's still 24 delicate religieuse to fill and to decorate...

675
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,960
不…
No...

676
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:05,720
. .还有令人惊叹的中心装饰。
..and stunning centrepieces to construct.

677
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:09,120
看那个。好伙计，很好。
Look at that. Good mate, very good.

678
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
他笑着说
HE CHUCKLES

679
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,800
我只是要确保所有东西都放平，这样，
I'm just making sure everything's level, so that,

680
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,160
当我们用它建造时，它不会倒塌。
when we build with it, it's not going to topple over.

681
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,360
巧克力建筑……
Building with chocolate...

682
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
. .或者牛轧糖，已经足够具有挑战性了。
..or nougatine, is challenging enough.

683
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,880
但是艾迪和马希德……
But Eddie and Mahshid...

684
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,040
. .两者都用。
..are using both.

685
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,960
显然，我们必须确保一切都在那里
Obviously, we've got to make sure that everything is there and that

686
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,000
你可以走了。
you're ready to go.

687
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
喷雾。
Spray.

688
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,440
我要把花拿出来。
I'm getting the flowers out.

689
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,200
对吧?是的。我们就快到了。
Right? Yes. And we're almost there.

690
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,640
它看起来像一件艺术品。
It looks like a piece of art.

691
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,920
不是吗?是的。
Does it? Yeah.

692
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,760
我跟你说，毕加索会嫉妒的。

并列第二的是琳恩和罗曼，

842
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,880
还有艾迪和马希德。

00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,840
那就只剩下银石的格雷厄姆和迪恩了，

844
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,680
还有夏威夷州烹饪学校的凯蒂和凯利。
and Katie and Kelly from the WI Cookery School.

845
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:18,280
经过深思熟虑，伯努瓦和珍爱已经决定

846
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,080
今晚离开我们的队伍是…

847
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,880
. .格雷厄姆和迪恩。

848
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:34,600
祝贺你们其他人。我们下周见。
Congratulations to the rest of you. We'll see you next week.

849
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,800
做得很好。做得很好。
Well done. Well done.

850
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,400
是的，我很难过要离开。
Yeah, I'm sad to be leaving.

851
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,160
我们为此付出了很多努力。
A lot of work, a lot of effort's gone into it.

852
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,240
但我认为这是女生们应得的。是的。
But I think the girls overall deserved it. Yeah.

853
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,600
再见。
See you later.

854
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:51,480
我们简直不敢相信。
We can't believe it.

855
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:53,520
我不认为这一定是件坏事
I don't think it's always necessarily a bad thing

856
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:55,920
也会一点点堕落，从优雅中堕落
to fall, as well, a little bit - fall from grace -

857
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,680
振作起来，让自己变得更好。
and pick yourself up and make yourself better.

858
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,560
干得好，斯拉夫人。给我一个拥抱。
Well done, Slav. Give me a hug.

859
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,120
我为自己感到骄傲，
I am very proud of myself,

860
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:06,120
但没有玛丽亚，我不可能有今天的成就。
but without Maria, I couldn't be where I am today.

861
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,920
这是我的荣幸。谢谢你，玛丽亚。
It's really a pleasure. Thank you, Maria.

862
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,000
汤姆:下一集，各队将面临秘方挑战。
TOM: Next time, the teams face a secret recipe challenge.

863
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:16,920
我们都没试过。
None of us have actually tried one before.

864
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,520
并且必须打造一个四季的样板…
And must fashion a four-season showpiece...

865
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,360
我不希望我最大的敌人也这样。
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

866
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,200
. .除了巧克力什么都没有。
..with nothing but chocolate.

867
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,320
只是内心充满了愤怒。
Just have such a rage inside.

868
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:28,440
谁将进入最后六强?哎呦。
Who will spring into the final six? Whoops.

869
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,840
还有她的法式蛋糕梦……温柔。
And whose patisserie dreams... Gentle.

870
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,160
. .会落到地球上吗?破解

871
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,360
哦,不!

Yes, very good.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,600
汤姆，你不会煮蛋糕。
Tom, you can't boil cakes.

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,880
你是这么说的，但也许这就是你没赢《烘焙大赛》的原因。
Well, so you say, but maybe that's why you didn't win Bake Off.

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,840
只是说。加油，利亚姆!我们下楼到厨房去吧。
Just saying. Come on, Liam! Let's go down to the kitchen.

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,840
看，糕点师一直在煎。
See with a pastry chef's been frying up.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,240
我不喜欢你，你知道的。
I don't like you, you know.

12
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,320
没人喜欢我，利亚姆，这是我的风格。
Nobody likes me, Liam, That's my thing.

13
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,600
上次，关于泡芙有很多麻烦。
Last time, there was much ado about choux.

14
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,240
R巧克力奴隶和玛丽亚的天堂展示品……

15
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,080
整天给我带这个，很可爱。

. .为他赢得了第一名。非常感谢。

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,400

WI Cookery School's Katie and Kelly faced nougaty hell...

18
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,440
这个结构缺失了很多。
This structure is missing a lot.

19
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,920
但那是银石的男孩，格雷厄姆和迪恩……
But it was the Silverstone boys, Graham and Dean...

20
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,720
会有一组轮胎。
There's going to be a group of tyres.

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,840
. .谁最后一次溜了。
..who slipped one last time.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,680
如果我往墙上扔，我肯定它们会弹回来。
If I throw on the wall, I'm sure they will bounce back.

23
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,760
. .然后就被淘汰了。
..and crashed out of the competition.

24
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,880
是的，我们很难过要离开。我们为此付出了很多努力。
Yeah, we're sad to be leaving. A lot of work, a lot of effort's gone into it.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,600
现在第二轮预赛结束了。
Now the second set of heats come to an end...

26
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,800
凯莉，你能处理这个吗?我来搞定。
Kelly, can you handle this? I've got this.

27
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,040
. .摄制组的食谱完全是个谜
..as the team's taken a recipe that's a total mystery...

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,880
我做错了什么?哦……
What am I doing wrong? Oh...

29
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,440
并尝试捕捉四季的魔力在一个宏伟的巧克力展示。
And try to capture the magic of the four seasons in one majestic chocolate showpiece.

30
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,440
一只小鸟在树枝上?为什么不呢?
A bird on a twig in a tree? Why not?

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,960
最后六个席位的归属岌岌可危
With the last places in the final six at stake...

32
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,680
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

33
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,240
哪三支球队会向前冲?
Which three teams will spring forward...

34
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,440
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

35
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,520
谁会倒下……全体:哦，不!哦!
And who will fall... ALL: Oh, no! Oh!

36
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,000
退出竞争?
Out of the competition?

37
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,280
我现在只想哭。
I just want to cry now.

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,240
今天是巧克力周。
It's chocolate week.

39
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,760
在这四支队伍中，
And of these four teams,

40
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,200
只有三支队伍可以进入决赛。
just three can progress to the final stages of the competition.

41
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,400
为了确保只有最好的人才能通过，
To make sure only the best go through,

42
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,480
评委们提出了一个秘密挑战。
the judges have raised the bar with a secret challenge.

43
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,080
早上好，厨师们!
Good morning, chefs!

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,360
考虑到即将发生的事，你们看起来吓坏了。
Given what's about to happen, you all look suitably terrified.

45
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:28,520
因为今天，你们将面临一个秘方挑战。
Because today, you will face a secret recipe challenge.

46
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
评委们将会给你一个惊喜，一个经典甜点的名字，
The judges are about to surprise you with the name of a classic dessert,

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,840
然后他们会期望你在没有任何练习或准备的情况下做出决定。
which they will then expect you to make with no practice or preparation whatsoever.

48
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,280
就像一个惊喜派对，但却是有史以来最可怕的惊喜派对!
It's like a surprise party, but the most horrible surprise party ever!

49
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,240
珍惜，请透露今天的秘方。
Cherish, please reveal today's secret recipe.

50
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,640
我们选择了一种经典的奥地利蛋糕。
We have chosen a classic Austrian cake.

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,400
随意言论。
Sachertorte.

52
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:56,400
我们会看到湿润的巧克力海绵和杏酱，
We will expect to see a moist chocolate sponge with apricot jam,

53
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,440
还有光滑的巧克力酱。
and a smooth ganache glaze.

54
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,320
我们希望你能把你的萨赫蛋糕放在巧克力摊上，
We would like you to serve your Sachertorte on a chocolate stand,

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,800
顶部是手工制作的双色巧克力花。
and topped with a bicolour, handcrafted chocolate flower.

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,240
厨师们，你们有3.5小时的时间来完成今天的秘方挑战。
Chefs, you have 3.5 hours to complete today's secret recipe challenge.

57
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,560
你的时间从现在开始。
And your time starts now.

58
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,920
好的。啊呀。
OK. Blimey.

59
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,720
哇。
Wow.

60
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:26,200
我从来没尝过沙赫蛋糕。
I haven't tasted Sachertorte before, ever.

61
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,240
所以我有点困惑。
So I'm a little bit confused.

62
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,640
今天，有一点转折。
Today, there is a little bit of a twist.

63
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:35,040
他们无法为我们的秘方挑战做准备。
They could not prepare for our secret recipe challenge.

64
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,120
我们开始写吧。
Let's get scribing.

65
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:41,120
他们必须运用自己的知识和本能来完成这项工作。
They have to bring their knowledge and instinct to make this work.

66
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,000
珍惜:在构建结构时，
CHERISH: When building the structure,

67
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,160
我们想看看厨师的创造力。
we would like to see the creativity of the chef.

68
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,440
然而，它需要足够的强度来容纳蛋糕。
However, it needs to be strong enough to hold the cake.

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,240
我不想看到崩溃。
I do not want to see a collapse.

70
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,200
这是干什么用的?我们可以用它做证人席。
What's this for? We can use it for the stand.

71
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,080
每个团队都有不同的模具，颜料，
Each team has been given various moulds, paints,

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,320
还有帮助他们搭建巧克力摊位的用具。
and utensils to help them create their chocolate stands.

73
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,920
这和……有什么关系?来个萨赫蛋糕?
How is this related...to a Sachertorte?

74
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,120
我是说，我们自己还没有解决这个问题。
I mean, we haven't worked that one out yet ourselves.

75
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,440
来吧。喷，喷，喷，喷，喷。
Come on. Spray, spray, spray, spray, spray.

76
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:16,840
这是艾迪和马什德的节目!嗨！各位，这是你们的海绵吗?
It's the Eddie and Mashid show! Hi! Guys, is this your sponge?

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,720
我担心你可能需要再来一次。
I'm worried you might need to do it again.

78
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,480
我认为这将是非常艰难的……
I think it's going to be very tough...

79
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,960
谁在做结构?我正在修结构。
Who's doing the structure? I'm working on the structure now.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,960
这是我们要做的支架的支架腿。
This is the legs for the stand that we're making.

81
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
腿吗?是的。的两条腿!
The legs? Yes. The legs!

82
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,480
就像一个灯台，你知道吗?
Almost like a lamp table, do you know...

83
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,040
三条腿还在吗?
With the three legs going?

84
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,840
哦,耶!然后我们把蛋糕放在上面。
Oh, yeah! And then we'll put the cake on top of that.

85
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,640
埃迪和马什德用一种直截了当的方法来对冲风险。
Eddie and Mashid are hedging their bets with a straightforward approach.

86
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,560
打算把他们的三脚站放低，给它上色
Planning to cast their three-legged stand low and colour it

87
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,400
加深红的可可脂。
with a dark red cocoa butter.

88
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,680
这足以让我们惊叹吗?
CHERISH: Is that enough to wow us?

89
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,360
埃迪:我们的目标就是熬过去。
EDDIE: Our aim is just to get through.

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
第一名还是第二名并不重要。
Doesn't matter about being first or second.

91
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,960
这是一个好办法吗?我想是的。做你认为最好的事。
Is this a good move? I think so. Do what you think is best.

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,040
做你认为对其他三支球队有影响的事情。是的。
Do what you think would make the difference with the other three teams. Yes.

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,680
把自己逼得更紧一点……
Pushing themselves a little further...

94
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,040
我需要画一些东西。
I need to draw something.

95
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,080
. .上周的获胜者斯拉夫和玛丽亚，
..last week's winners, Slav and Maria,

96
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,360
我想出了一个更有野心的设计。
have come up with a more ambitious design.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,320
我们在巧克力行业，所以我们很有信心。
We are in the chocolate industry, so we are confident.

98
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,640
所以我要用三个不同的圆柱体做一个支架。
So I'm going to make a stand with three different cylinders.

99
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,200
一个在这里。
So one will be here.

100
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,720
一个在这里。然后，蛋糕在这里。
One here. And then, the cake here.

101
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,040
建造一个高耸的三层建筑足以支撑
Building a towering trio of tiers strong enough to support

102
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,800
一个沙赫蛋糕就可以了
a Sachertorte will take

103
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,800
斯拉夫的专业技能
all of Slav's well-honed expertise.

104
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,920
当我年轻的时候，我曾经是一个木匠。
When I was younger, I used to be a carpenter.

105
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,680
这有点像搭建桌子或厨房。
It's a bit of building a table or kitchen.

106
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,160
所以对我来说，当我完成最终作品时，我真的很开心。
So for me, when I come to the final product, it makes me really happy.

107
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,400
好了，开始吧。
Right, here we go.

108
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,640
开始吧。
Here we go.

109
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,480
各队开始铸造他们的核心。
The teams get to work casting their centrepieces.

110
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,880
如果它们不能迅速起作用……哎呦。对不起。
If they don't work quickly... Whoops. Sorry.

111
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,560
. .他们的架子放不下蛋糕。
..their stands won't set strong enough to hold their cakes.

112
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,960
你能把戒指递给我吗，凯利?
Can you pass me that ring, Kelly?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
我可能会放点东西让它保持稳定。
I might put something there to kind of keep it stable.

114
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,480
尽管上周勉强过关，
Despite just scraping through last week,

115
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,280
WI烹饪学校的目标仍然很高。
the WI Cookery School are still aiming high.

116
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:01,760
凯丽和凯蒂精心打造的摩天石柱就这样诞生了
Kelly and Katie's delicately cast sky-scraping pillar should result

117
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,640
在一个对抗重力的站位上。
in a gravity-defying stand.

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,000
我的杆子太大了。我很害怕。
My pole's too big. I'm scared.

119
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:11,160
哦,不。祝你好运，伙计，你能行的。让我们开始吧。
Oh, no. Good luck, mate, you've got this. Let's go for it.

120
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,600
为了确保自己进入六强，
Determined to secure their place in the final six,

121
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,680
皇家酒店咖啡厅也在冒险。
Hotel Cafe Royal are also taking a risk.

122
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,200
我想画个圈……
I was thinking of just doing a circle...

123
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,400
但我想那就太简单了。
But then I guess it'll be too simple.

124
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,480
以一种本能的方式……
With an instinctive approach...

125
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,200
你的展台有画吗?
Do you have any drawing for your stand?

126
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,800
是的，在那儿。哦，在那儿?
Yes, it's there. Oh, it's there?

127
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,560
噢!琳恩不知道吗?
Ooh! Leanne doesn't know it?

128
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,360
我把它画出来，它会像这样，像这样，像这样。
I draw it, so it's going to be like this and like that, and like this...

129
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,080
然后站起来，可能在这里开花……差不多就是这样。好的。
And then stand, and probably flower here... Something like that. OK.

130
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,200
我想我在医院里见过一个。
Ooh, I think I've seen one of those in hospital.

131
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,480
他还活着吗?
LAUGHTER Was he alive?

132
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,320
如果凭感觉飞行还不够大胆，
If flying by the seat of his pants wasn't daring enough,

133
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,640
罗曼还计划在他的摊位中央挖一个大洞。
Romain also plans to carve a gaping hole in the centre of his stand.

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,440
我想到了一个主意，但我知道这要花些时间。
I've come up with an idea, but I know it's going to take me time.

135
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,400
我真的不想惹麻烦，所以…
I really don't want to be in trouble, so...

136
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,840
我遇到了困难。
I'm running into difficulty.

137
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,640
哦……
Oh...

138
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
这是可怕的。
That's horrible.

139
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,240
好吧。哔哔声。
All right. BLEEP.

140
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:19,440
哦……厨师!你还有两个小时，两个小时!
Oh... Chefs! You have two hours left, two hours left!

141
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,640
哦，别这样。
Oh, don't do that.

142
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,880
你可以做下一个。很好。
You can do the next one. Fine.

143
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,920
如果想知道他们的巧克力元素是否会及时凝固
If wondering whether their chocolate elements will set in time

144
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,800
压力还不够大……
wasn't stressful enough...

145
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,600
好了，好了，好了，好了。
Right, done, done, done, done, done.

146
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,960
让我们开始吧。
Let's go for it.

147
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,320
还有一种经典的奥地利蛋糕。
There's also a classic Austrian cake to perfect.

148
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,880
沙赫蛋糕就是海绵蛋糕!
The Sachertorte is all about the sponge!

149
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,040
使用错误的比例，它会变得非常干燥。
Use the wrong ratio, it becomes very dry.

150
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,480
过度烘烤，它会变得很干。
Over bake it, it becomes very dry.

151
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,640
这是关于理解你想用海绵达到什么目的。
It's about understanding what you're trying to achieve with this sponge.

152
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,840
然后移动到果酱。
Then move to the jam.

153
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,120
浓郁新鲜的杏味需要呈现出来。
The strong, fresh flavour of apricot needs to be present.

154
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,520
还有美味的黑巧克力甘纳许，
And there is the glorious dark chocolate ganache,

155
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
这样就结束了。
which will finish it off.

156
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,480
厨师掌握基本食谱的知识是非常重要的。
It's very important that the chef has the knowledge to execute the basic recipe.

157
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,840
我希望他们能做对。
I expect them to get it right.

158
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,800
不能犯任何错误。
No mistake should be made.

159
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,080
好了，我要开始用海绵了。
Right, I'm going to start working out the sponge.

160
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,880
好的。
OK.

161
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:20,400
评委们已经给了每个队他们需要的所有材料。
The judges have given each team all the ingredients they need...

162
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,840
把它们混合在一起，加入到甘纳许中。
We mix these together, and add that to our ganache.

163
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:24,920
不。
No.

164
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,040
. .但不是方法。
..but not the method.

165
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,000
这就像是一个技术问题，不是吗?
This is pretty much like a technical, isn't it?

166
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,840
差不多。今天有点像猜谜游戏。
Pretty much. It's a bit of a guessing game today.

167
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,000
我从来没试过。
See, I've never tried one.

168
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,600
比如，你知道会有什么样的口感吗，或者……
Like, do you know what to expect in terms of the texture, or...

169
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,840
不知道，我也不知道是怎么回事。
Not really, I don't know really know neither how it is.

170
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,160
我们都没试过。
None of us have actually tried one before.

171
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:43,520
R巧克力!你觉得秘方挑战怎么样?
R Chocolate! How do you feel about the secret recipe challenge?

172
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,080
感觉很好。你熟悉这个吗?
Feeling very good. Are you familiar with this?

173
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,320
是的，我去过维也纳的萨赫酒店……
Yeah, I've been to the Sacher Hotel in Vienna...

174
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,320
啊,哇!蛋糕的发源地，
Ah, wow! Where the cake originated,

175
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,280
所以我期待着做一些类似的东西。
so I'm looking forward to making something similar.

176
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,440
好吧，我们走着瞧。
OK, we shall see.

177
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,280
利亚姆:为了做出评委们想要的完美轻盈的海绵，
LIAM: In order to create the perfectly light sponge the judges are looking for,

178
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:01,600
厨师们必须精确地工作。
the chefs must work precisely.

179
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,200
我想先放个蛋黄，然后是面粉，最后再把它拌进蛋白霜里。
I was thinking a egg yolk, then the flour, then fold it into the meringue at the end.

180
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:09,320
太好了。自从我上次成功以来，我已经有了一个孩子。我生锈的。
Great. I've had a child since I last made it. I'm rusty.

181
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,480
如果顺序不对，它们的混合物就会变得太密，
Get the order wrong, and their mixture will become too dense,

182
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,280
海绵可能会塌陷。
and the sponge could collapse.

183
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
有一天，我在看食谱，
The other day, I was just looking through recipes,

184
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
我看到了沙赫托蛋糕，我就想，不，他们不会给我们这个的。
and I saw the Sachertorte, and I was like, no, they're not going to give us that.

185
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:22,680
我只是浏览了一下。
And I just flicked through it.

186
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,040
我希望我所做的是正确的。
I hope it's correct, what I'm doing.

187
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,040
我觉得我需要做一个双重食谱，
I feel like I need to do a double recipe,

188
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,920
因为这个量很小。
because the quantity's quite small.

189
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,000
所有的事情?不，不，我现在要加蛋白霜。
Everything done? No, no, I need to add the meringue now.

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,880
是的。是的。褶皱。是的。
Yes. Yes. Fold it. Yes.

191
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,560
这是海绵，可以吗?
Here's the sponge, is it OK?

192
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,480
我想是的。你是这么想的。
I think so. You think so.

193
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,320
烤一下就知道了。
Just bake it and see.

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,680
我想我要做一个双重食谱，我要试试。
I think I'm going to make a double recipe, I'm going to go for it.

195
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,120
看起来很乱。没关系。
It looks such a mess. It's OK.

196
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,280
好了，伙计，你觉得这混合物怎么样?是的，去吧。
All right, mate, what do you think of that mixture? Yeah, go for it.

197
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,120
我只希望海绵能达到评委们的期望。
I just hope that the sponge will be what the judges are expecting.

198
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,760
非常好，又轻又湿的海绵。
Really nice, light and moist sponge.

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,400
要做出完美的湿沙蛋糕…
To achieve a perfectly moist Sachertorte...

200
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,160
好了，我要进去了。
Right, I'm going in.

201
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,680
各队必须严格控制烘焙时间。
The teams must be exact with their baking time.

202
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,280
我们从15开始吧?然后再检查一下。
Let's start with 15? And then we'll check.

203
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,960
再过一分钟，他们的海绵就干了。
A minute over could leave their sponges dry.

204
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,200
没有犯错的余地。
There's no room for error.

205
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,480
你要做多久的蛋糕?
How long are you cooking the cakes for?

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,400
看。
Look.

207
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,600
本来是30分钟的，但是…哦，不，不，不，不。
It was supposed to be 30 minutes, but... Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

208
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:34,400
她忘了按计时器上的开始键。
She forgot to press start on the timer.

209
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,480
过半了，大厨们，过半了!
Halfway through, Chefs, halfway through!

210
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,440
我在做杏果酱。
I am doing the apricot jam.

211
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,520
我以前在匈牙利经常做果酱。
I used to make a lot of jam before in Hungary.

212
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,480
我们家乡的习俗是，我们有一整个冬天的储备。
Our custom back home was that we have reserves for the whole winter.

213
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,960
有一点压力。我不想失去WI的声誉。
There's a little bit of pressure. I don't want to lose the reputation of the WI.

214
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,640
不会做果酱。
Not being able to make jam.

215
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,800
是的,不是吗?要再来点柠檬汁吗?就碰一下。
Yes, no? Needs a little bit more lemon juice? Just a touch.

216
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,440
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

217
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,440
我想我在里面放了太多果酱。也许再加一些果泥进去。
I think I put too much jam on in. Maybe add some more puree then to it.

218
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,800
果酱很漂亮。哔哔
The jam is beautiful. BEEPING

219
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,560
那是你的计时器。是的!关键时刻到了。
That is your timer. Yes! The moment of truth.

220
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,920
我要打开它。
I'm going to open it.

221
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,520
来吧，我们开始吧。它的风险。
Go on, let's do it. Risk it.

222
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,840
是，不是，也许吧?是的，搞定了。是吗?
Yes, no, maybe? Yeah, it's done. Yeah?

223
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,400
斯拉夫人，这是干净的。
Slav, this is clean.

224
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,320
就这些吗?完美的。
That's it? Perfect.

225
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,520
伴侣……是吗?. .这是完成了。
Mate... Yeah? ..it's done.

226
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,880
嗯?海绵，我觉得太硬了。
Huh? The sponge, I think it's too hard.

227
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,440
我该怎么办，我该怎么办，我该怎么办?
What shall I do, what shall I do, what shall I do?

228
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,000
做一个新的。做一个新的。
Do a new one. Do a new one.

229
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,720
我只是不记得顺序了。
I just don't remember the order.

230
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,880
我做得不对，我还不知道是什么。
Something I'm not doing correctly, I don't know quite what it is yet.

231
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,040
煎饼吗?我们又来了。
Pancake? We're making it again.

232
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,880
你在做海绵，是吗?是的。
You're making your sponge, yeah? Yes.

233
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:01,280
大厨们，你们还有一个小时!那是一个小时!
Chefs, you have one hour left! That's one hour!

234
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
我做错了什么?
What am I doing wrong?

235
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,160
哦，别这样!
Oh, come on!

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
标准组件…
Standard components...

237
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,000
巧克力已经做好了。
The chocolate's set.

238
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,280
. .准备行动。
..ready for action.

239
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,840
是啊，还不错。
Yeah, not bad.

240
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,920
说实话，你知道这让我想起了什么吗?
Honestly, do you know what it reminds me of?

241
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,600
我明白你的意思。他笑了，走开。
I know what you mean. HE LAUGHS Go away.

242
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:22,200
现在他们的设计必须接受考验。
Now their designs must be put to the test.

243
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,760
现在我要开始组装支架了。
I'm now going to start assembling the stand.

244
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,880
好了，现在有点吓人了。
All right, scary bit now.

245
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,520
为了避免不可想象的事情……
To avoid the unthinkable...

246
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,880
只是为了确保蛋糕在上面，
Just to make sure the cake and stay on it,

247
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,120
并不是所有的东西都会崩溃。
and not everything will collapse.

248
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,440
. .每一个关节……
..every single joint...

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,160
哦!. .一定非常安全。
Oh! ..must be perfectly secure.

250
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,600
不。我要把它摘下来。
No. I'm taking it off.

251
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,000
海绵怎么样了?太浓了，太可怕了。
How's the sponge? Too dense, it's terrible.

252
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,080
我有些地方做得不对。
There's something I'm not doing right.

253
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,560
我的脑子一片空白，我该怎么办?
My mind is blank, what should I do?

254
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,640
这绝对是甘纳许和蛋白霜。
It's a ganache and meringue, definitely.

255
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,680
你有那么多钱吗?
Have you got that much?

256
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,760
是在正中间吗?我不知道，你告诉我。
Is it directly in the middle? I don't know, you tell me.

257
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,400
它不直……
It's not straight...

258
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,920
角。
The angle.

259
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,200
是的,不是吗?是的。我想是的。是的。
Yeah, no? Yeah. I think so. Yeah.

260
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,320
所以蛋糕也要直接放在上面吗?是的。
So, the cake's going directly on top, as well? Yeah.

261
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,760
你认为它会下降吗?不要……不!
Do you think it's going to drop? Don't... No!

262
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,720
不，它不会下降。因为你是建筑女神。
No, it's not going to drop. Because you're a structural goddess.

263
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,000
我做错了什么?快点，快点，集中精神。
What am I doing wrong? Come on, come on, concentrate.

264
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,440
冷静点，马希德，没事的。哦，我想起来了!
Calm down, Mashid, it's OK. Oh, I remember now!

265
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
怎么啦？把巧克力拌进去，然后…哦!
What? You fold in the chocolate, and then the... Oh!

266
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,800
从头再来。
Start all over again.

267
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,800
等等，你在做海绵?第三次了。怎么啦？怎么会？
Wait, you're making the sponge? For the third time. What? How come?

268
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,440
所以我第一次做的时候，它变得太稠密了。
So the first time I made it, it became too dense.

269
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,040
然后我又开始了，然后我记起了方法。
Then I started again, and then I remember the method.

270
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,120
这是第三次了，我希望你是幸运的。
So this is the third time, lucky, I hope.

271
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,160
大厨们，你们还有半个小时!
Chefs, you have half an hour left!

272
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,360
我们还有半个小时。来吧，马希德，我们走。
We have half an hour left. Come on, Mashid, let's go.

273
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,200
马希德的海绵才刚刚放进烤箱…
With Mashid's sponge only just in the oven...

274
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,600
我向上帝祈祷这能奏效。
I pray to God this will work.

275
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,840
. .其他队伍已经准备好开始分层了。
..the other teams are ready to begin layering.

276
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:07,480
最后，最重要的是巧克力甘纳许釉。
And for the final flourish, the all-important chocolate ganache glaze.

277
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:11,960
要有丝滑的口感非常重要。
It's very important to have a silky and smooth texture to this.

278
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,960
坚持是关键。巧克力和奶油的比例不对，
Consistency is key. Get the wrong ratio of chocolate and cream,

279
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,040
而且釉料太厚，倒不出来，容易裂开。
and the glaze will be too thick to pour and could split.

280
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:23,400
你相信我能搞定这个吗?伙计，我把生命托付给你。
Do you trust me to glaze this? Mate, I trust you with my life.

281
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,920
我认为……喜欢它，喜欢它，喜欢它。
I think... Like it, like it, like that.

282
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,560
这和我们通常烘焙的釉面很不一样。
This is a very different glaze to what we normally bake.

283
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,720
显然我不知道我们做得对不对。
And obviously I don't know if we made it right.

284
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,680
这个非常非常厚。我们不能有一个良好的流程。
This is very, very thick. We're not able to have a nice flow.

285
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,600
不要脱得太多，因为那样他们会看到层次感。
Don't take off too much, because then they will see the layers.

286
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,880
好了，准备好了吗?
All right, you ready?

287
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,720
它在中间。慢慢来。
It's in the middle. Take your time.

288
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,960
它不在中间。
It's not in the middle.

289
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,880
我再也不碰它了。不。没有?不，它要裂开了。好的。
I'm not touching it any longer. No. No? No, it's going to crack. OK.

290
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,320
准备好了吗?是的。
Ready? Yep.

291
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,080
好吗，好吗，好吗?
Are we good, are we good, are we good?

292
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,360
不。你真的是直接进入了哔哔声。
Nope. You've literally just gone straight into the BLEEP.

293
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,720
它很好。我们还有多长时间?
It's fine. How long have we got?

294
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,480
大厨们，你们还有15分钟!
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left!

295
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:13,560
加油，加油，加油。这需要尽快公布。
Come on, come on, come on. That needs to come out sooner.

296
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,080
你在干什么?我在做花的中心。
What are you doing? I'm doing the centre for the flower.

297
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,280
各队还需要制作精致的巧克力花……
The teams still have their delicate chocolate flower to cast...

298
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,720
巧克力在凝固，凝固，凝固。
Chocolate is setting, setting, setting.

299
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
. .完全用手。
..entirely by hand.

300
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,560
我的手是世界上最辣的，所以只要我一碰巧克力，
I have the world's hottest hands, so as soon as I touch chocolate,

301
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,960
它就这样……他们没那么糟糕!那里像不冷不热。
it just goes... They're not that bad! There like lukewarm.

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,080
你觉得呢?好的，谢谢你。
Do you think? OK, well, thank you.

303
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,760
这些叶子好薄啊，马什德。我希望这是正确的。
Oh, these leaves are so thin, Mashid. I hope this holds.

304
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,920
你没事吧?只是出了点小问题。
You all right? Just having a few little, snappy issues.

305
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,000
哦!我们只放一朵花在上面。
Oh! We're only going to have one flower on it.

306
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,920
因为我一转，花瓣就碎了。
Because the little petals are breaking as I was going around.

307
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,000
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

308
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,920
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

309
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,080
怎么样?好。只是需要快速冷却。
How is it? Good. It just needs to cool down fast.

310
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,840
在爆炸中直接摇摆。
Rock it straight in the blast.

311
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:10,240
哔哔声!把它放下，放下，放下。
BLEEP! Just put it down, put it down, put it down.

312
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,280
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

313
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:20,480
请留在这里!待在这里，别动。
Please stay here! Stay here, don't move.

314
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:23,960
大厨们，你们还有一分钟，就一分钟!
Chefs, you have one minute left, that's one minute!

315
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,600
哔哔声。我需要工作。
BLEEP. I need to work.

316
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:31,160
让我们先做完，然后，如果我们有时间……
Let's finish first, and then, if we have time to do that...

317
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,200
不，不，不。准备好了吗?是的。
No, no, no, no. Ready? Yeah.

318
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,600
树叶,叶子。
Leaves, leaves.

319
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,200
我们需要给它上釉。压下去，压下去，压下去。
We need to glaze it. Push it down, push it down, push it down.

320
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,200
厨师……让我们移动它。你的时间到了!
Chefs... Let's move it. ..your time is up!

321
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,640
你的时间到此为止。
That is the end of your time.

322
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,800
我们可以做得更多。是啊，只是…海绵。
We could've done more. Yeah, it's just...the sponge.

323
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
它很好。如果交易中断，
It's fine. If it breaks in transaction,

324
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,480
它在事务中中断。
it breaks in transaction.

325
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,200
四个沙赫蛋糕和四个手工摊位
Four sachertortes and four handcrafted stands

326
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:26,280
现在面临着珍爱和伯努瓦的审判。
now face the judgment of Cherish and Benoit.

327
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,760
请皇家咖啡厅的Leanne和Romain过来好吗
Would Leanne and Romain from Hotel Cafe Royal please come forward

328
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,320
把你的沙赫蛋糕带到裁判桌上?
and bring your sachertortes to the judging table?

329
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,280
我喜欢整个结构。很不错。
I like the whole structure. It's quite nice.

330
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,920
我想你已经考虑过了。
I think you've thought about it.

331
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,880
小花，你正朝着我们想去的方向走，
The little flower, you were going in the direction we wanted to go,

332
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,200
但我想要更多，伙计们
but I wanted more, guys.

333
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,680
你说的上釉蛋糕是什么意思?
What do you understand when you say a glazed cake?

334
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,960
我会说它是被倒在蛋糕上的地方。
I would say it's where it's been poured on top of the cake.

335
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,320
我有一个涂有涂层的蛋糕，所以我不太确定这是否符合要求。
I have a coated cake, so I'm not too sure whether this met the brief.

336
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,680
我们要尝尝吗?
Should we taste?

337
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,360
这不是我记忆中的那个萨切尔了。
Well, this is not the sacher I remember.

338
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,880
海绵本身很干，果酱对我来说太酸了。
The sponge itself is quite dry, and the jam is too acidic for me.

339
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,560
你在杏酱里放什么东西了吗?
Did you put anything in your apricot jam?

340
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,920
柠檬皮。好吧，这就是我得到的。
Lemon zest. OK, well, that's what I got.

341
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,240
揉面时的柑橘味，
That citrusy flavour when you mix up the dough,

342
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,760
你都快脸红了。
you're almost going orangey.

343
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
你在创造别的东西。
You're creating something else.

344
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,600
我觉得我们不能把这个叫做沙赫蛋糕。不。
I don't think we can call this one quite a sachertorte. No.

345
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,600
但还是非常感谢你。谢谢你！
But thank you very much for that. Thank you.

346
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,080
老实说，情况可能会更糟。
Honestly, it could have been worse.

347
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,280
哦，天啊，天啊，天啊。
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

348
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,680
三个半小时，你就给我这个?
With three and a half hours, this is what you give me?

349
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,280
我对此很不高兴。不，我们也不是。
I'm not happy about it. No, neither are we.

350
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,080
首先，我们要求上釉，你给我上釉。
First of all, we asked for a glaze, you give me coat.

351
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,200
你觉得这够漂亮吗?
Do think this is beautiful enough?

352
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
说得够多了，我想是时候尝尝了。
Enough said, I think it's time to taste.

353
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,480
我认为有效的原因是海绵没有那么干
I think what works is the fact that the sponge is not as dry

354
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,800
这是可能的。
as it could be.

355
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,760
再说一次，我不认为这是沙赫蛋糕。
Again, I would not call this a sachertorte.

356
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,840
海绵里应该装满了巧克力……
The sponge is supposed to be full of chocolate...

357
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,080
我不明白。
I don't get it in there.

358
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,400
还有，我觉得你的巧克力酱裂开了。
And also, I think your ganache is split.

359
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,840
好的。好吧，明天总会有的。
OK. OK, there is always tomorrow.

360
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,720
是的。谢谢你！谢谢你！
Yes. Thank you. Thank you.

361
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,800
太有趣了!
That was fun!

362
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,600
R巧克力店的斯拉夫和玛丽亚，
Slav and Maria from R Chocolate,

363
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:36,360
请把你的沙赫蛋糕拿到裁判台来好吗?
could you please bring your sachertorte to the judging table?

364
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
小心，小心，小心。
Careful, careful, careful.

365
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:49,320
大厨，我喜欢你用的颜色，
Well, Chef, I love the way you used the colour,

366
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,480
红色和黄色，但作为一个整体，
the red and the yellow, but as a whole,

367
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,440
最后的收尾很笨拙。
the finishing is heavy-handed.

368
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,360
我以前看过你的一些巧克力作品，
I have seen some of your chocolate work before,

369
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,520
它更精致一些。
it was a little bit more refined.

370
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,160
但它的内部可能依然美丽。
But it may still be beautiful inside.

371
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
我有一些湿气，
I've got some kind of moisture,

372
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,920
我更喜欢蛋糕的巧克力味
and I prefer the sacher to taste a little bit more chocolate

373
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,880
而不是杏子，这是事实。
than apricots personally, which is the case.

374
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,000
至于我，我喜欢你的巧克力酱，
Well, as for me, I love your ganache,

375
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,600
它非常光滑和漂亮。
it's very smooth and nice.

376
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,520
好吧，总而言之，我们快到了。
OK, well, all in all, we're getting there.

377
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,440
它尝起来比看起来好。
It's tasting better than it looks.

378
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:18,920
谢谢你！谢谢大家。
Thank you. Thank you, guys.

379
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,760
来自WI烹饪学校的凯蒂和凯莉，
Katie and Kelly from The WI Cookery School,

380
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,440
请把你的沙赫蛋糕拿到裁判台来好吗?
could you please bring your Sachertorte to the judging table?

381
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
她喃喃自语的说了
SHE MUMBLES

382
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,000
哦!哦,不!
Oh! Oh, no!

383
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,000
你是认真的吗?
Are you serious?

384
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,760
解构wienerschnitzel”。
Deconstructed sachertorte.

385
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,640
这就是精神。
That's the spirit.

386
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,200
我很惊讶它是怎么站起来的
I was surprised how it got to stand

387
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,360
这么久了，说实话，但是，嘿!
for that long, to be honest with you, but, hey!

388
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,320
如果你想出这样的设计，
If you come up with a design like this one,

389
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,800
你对结构的理解还有待改进。
your understanding of structure is to be worked on.

390
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,680
对我来说海绵烤得很好。
The sponge to me is baked correctly.

391
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,040
你给蛋糕上了釉，效果就不一样了。
You glazed the cake, it makes a difference.

392
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,560
这果酱是我吃过的最好的，
The jam is the best I've tasted,

393
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:25,200
但是，看看这里的肿块和凸起。
however, look at the lumps and bumps over here.

394
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,320
如果你能好好执行
If you could have executed nicely,

395
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,240
这可能是一件很不错的作品。
this could be a very nice piece of work.

396
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
好的，非常感谢。
Well, thank you very much.

397
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,120
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

398
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,760
我们做了一个可口的沙赫蛋糕。
We made a sachertorte that was palatable.

399
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,080
如果我们出去，我们就出去，
If we go out, we go out,

400
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,040
但至少我们会大干一场。
but at least we'll go out with a bang.

401
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,480
绝对的。字面上。是的。
Absolutely. Literally. Yeah.

402
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,920
我们明天得努力工作，天啊。
We need to work hard tomorrow, my God.

403
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
我们今晚得好好谈谈，
We have to really sit down tonight,

404
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,640
谈谈我们的策略和计划。
talk about our strategy, our plan.

405
00:21:55,680 --> 00:22:00,160
把我们的精力和一切都集中在明天的展览上，
Focus our energy, everything we have on the showpiece tomorrow,

406
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,600
希望这能帮我们渡过难关。
and then hopefully that will get us through.

407
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,440
汤姆:在明天的表演挑战之前，
TOM: Ahead of tomorrow's showpiece challenge,

408
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,800
各队有黄金时间准备元素
the teams have been given a golden hour to prepare elements

409
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,240
需要成型或放置过夜。
that need moulding or sitting overnight.

410
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,920
看着裁判，我觉得有点野蛮，
Looking at the judging, I thought it was a bit savage,

411
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,160
但这可能是公平的。
but it was probably fair.

412
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,840
我觉得这是一个灾难性的早晨。
I think it was a disastrous morning.

413
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,680
不是对候选人不敬
No disrespect of the candidates,

414
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,800
这是他们没有预料到的。
it was something they were not expecting to get.

415
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,400
那么，你觉得谁领先?
So, who do you think was in the lead?

416
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,040
可能是R巧克力，因为他们做了一个沙赫蛋糕
Potentially R Chocolate, because they've done a sachertorte

417
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,760
哪个吃起来更舒服。
which is more pleasant to eat.

418
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,280
谁有麻烦了?
And who is in trouble?

419
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,680
艾迪和马希德。
Eddie and Mahshid.

420
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,760
他们显然没有策略，
They clearly went without a strategy,

421
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,160
这就是他们的失败。
and that was their downfall.

422
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,960
你需要退后一步，你需要分析。
You need to stand back and you need to analyse.

423
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,800
那么，让我们来谈谈WI。在它坠落之前，是的，
So, let's talk about The WI. Before it fell, yeah,

424
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,880
我以为巧克力之神和他们在一起。
I thought the chocolate gods were with them.

425
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,440
老实说，他们一直否认这一点。
Let's be honest about it, they lived in denial that this would stand.

426
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,960
不是是否会发生，而是什么时候会发生。
It's not if, but when, this is happening.

427
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,560
我今天看不到他们眼中想要赢的火花。
I cannot see the spark in their eyes today that they want to win.

428
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,160
我希望他们明天能回来战斗。
I hope that they come back fighting tomorrow.

429
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,640
他们能做到吗?
Can they deliver?

430
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,120
希望球队明天能有更好的表现。
Let's just hope the teams have a better day tomorrow.

431
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,560
我相信他们能做到，
I'm sure that they can do it,

432
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,560
他们只需要把功率调大一点。
they just need to turn up the power a little bit.

433
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,120
早....
Morning.

434
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:22,160
汤姆:最后六强只剩下三个梦寐以求的名额了。
TOM: Just three coveted places in the final six remain.

435
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,160
利亚姆:这是两队最后的机会
LIAM: And this showpiece challenge is the last chance the teams

436
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,880
将不得不声明他们的主张。
will have to stake their claim.

437
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,520
评委们，你们对这个巧克力展示品有什么想法?
So, judges, what have you in mind for this chocolate showpiece?

438
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,240
它能兼作算盘吗?
Should it double as an abacus?

439
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,640
有一个有意识的灵魂?
Have a conscious soul?

440
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,200
吃之前能洗碗吗?
Be able to do the washing up before you eat it?

441
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
我们希望你能做一场精彩的表演，
We expect you to make a spectacular showpiece,

442
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:49,000
身高至少70厘米，灵感来自四季。
standing at least 70cm high and inspired by four seasons.

443
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,280
你的展品必须有特色
Your showpiece must feature

444
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,160
两种不同的模制巧克力，每种24颗，
two different types of moulded and filled chocolates, 24 of each,

445
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,800
你的展品还必须包括一个活动部件。
and your showpiece must also include a moving part.

446
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,720
厨师们，你们昨晚只有一个小时准备，你们有
Chefs, you had one hour last night to prepare, and you have

447
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:08,880
距离完成今天的挑战还有四小时。
four hours remaining to complete today's showpiece challenge.

448
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,760
你的时间从现在开始。
And your time starts now.

449
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,960
好了，准备好了吗?
Right, are you ready for this?

450
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,280
要想进入六强，
To earn a place in the final six,

451
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,240
各队必须用巧克力来证明他们的实力
the teams must prove their prowess with chocolate

452
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,800
通过让一个展示品栩栩如生地展现出当时的辉煌
by bringing to life a showpiece that captures the splendour

453
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,440
以及我们不断变化的自然世界的复杂性。
and complexity of our ever-changing natural world.

454
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,440
主题是四季，
So, the theme is four seasons,

455
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:38,320
他们想怎么解释都可以，
and they can interpret it whatever way they want,

456
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,440
但这是一个展示性的挑战，我们想要被惊艳到。
but it's a showpiece challenge, we want to be wowed.

457
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,000
还会有更多的。
There's going to be some more.

458
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:45,480
他们展示了不同的技术技能，
They showcase different technical skill,

459
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,160
比如造型、手工制作、雕刻。
like moulding, handcrafting, sculpturing.

460
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,880
我们还增加了一个活动部件。
And we have added a moving part.

461
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:55,480
它可以像一个小抽屉一样简单，也可以更有技术含量，
It could be as simple as a little drawer or more technical,

462
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,480
你在某处有个小马达。
and you've got a little motor somewhere.

463
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,960
为了配合他们的季节性表演，
To accompany their seasonal showpieces,

464
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,520
参赛队伍还必须生产48颗丰盛的糖果。
the teams must also produce 48 sumptuous bonbons.

465
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,520
蛋壳必须做得很薄，
The shell has to be thinly made,

466
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,440
当我掰开巧克力的时候，它就会啪的一声。
and when I break the chocolate, it should snap.

467
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,160
馅料要光滑，要有味道
The filling needs to be smooth and the flavour provided show to us

468
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,400
你了解自己的口味。
that you understand your taste.

469
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,680
我们想看看他们有多强才能成为最好的三支球队
We want to see how good they are in order to be the best three teams

470
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,560
进入下一轮。
to go to the next round.

471
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,800
巧克力一直是我喜欢的东西。
It's always something I've enjoyed, chocolate.

472
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,720
我喜欢有创意，你知道，
I like to be creative and, you know,

473
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,760
这基本上就像雕刻一件艺术品。
this is like carving a piece of art, basically.

474
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,080
而球队可以自由地代表多个赛季
While the teams are free to represent as many seasons

475
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,680
随他们的便，琳恩和罗曼
as they like, Leanne and Romain

476
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,120
把所有的精力都集中在一件事上。
are concentrating all their efforts on just one.

477
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,720
所以你今天打算谨慎行事吗?
So you are going to play safe today?

478
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,960
这不是在保守行事。
It's not playing it safe.

479
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,600
我们正在尝试做更多的技巧。
We're trying to do more finesse.

480
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,080
我们要去春天。
We're going for spring.

481
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,360
我们会有一些不错的，比如，
We're going to have some nice, like,

482
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,160
那里有向日葵，还有大黄蜂。
sunflowers on there, and bumblebees.

483
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,120
我们将有一个会移动的蜂巢。
We're going to have a beehive that will move.

484
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,840
利亚姆:通过制作一套充满覆盆子和柚子的糖果
LIAM: By crafting one set of bonbons filled with zesty raspberry and yuzu

485
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,960
另一种则含有鲜橙和肉桂，
and another containing zingy orange and cinnamon,

486
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,640
他们还希望用自己的口味来捕捉春天
they also hope to capture spring with their flavours

487
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,120
还有他们的设计。
as well as their design.

488
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,760
色彩鲜艳,春天吗?
Colourful, spring?

489
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,960
绿色和黄色。
Green and yellow.

490
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,360
因为一开始我们想的是秋天，
Because at the beginning we were thinking about autumn,

491
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,600
只剩下棕色的叶子之类的东西，
just going to be brown leaves and stuff like that,

492
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,520
我想这并不是很愉快。
which is not very enjoyable, I guess.

493
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,320
艾迪和马希德不这么认为。
A point of view not shared by Eddie and Mahshid.

494
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,480
我们选择了一个秋天的主题。
We chose an autumn theme.

495
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,600
我们想专注于一个赛季，并为你们做得很好。
We wanted to focus on one season and do it nicely for you guys.

496
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,320
我去收集真树叶。
I went and collected real leaves, yeah.

497
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,120
哇!哇!
Wow! Wow!

498
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,400
啊，好的，很好。所以他们会下真正的雨
Ah, OK, nice. So they're going to have the real rain

499
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,640
还有结构。
and the structure on.

500
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,840
汤姆:希望把昨天抛在脑后，
TOM: Hoping to put yesterday behind them,

501
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,840

00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,880
给我们介绍一下你的活动部件。所以，在树干里面
Take us through your moving part. So, inside the tree trunk

507
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,280
我们要做一些抽屉，
we're going to make some drawers,

508
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,960
里面也会装满我们的糖果。好的。
and they'll be filled with our bonbons inside there, as well. OK.

509
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,640
你酷吗?
You cool?

510
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,360
必须是。

我们很乐意成为这次巧克力挑战的国王和王后。

相信他们的经验会给他们带来优势，
Convinced their experience will give them the edge,

513
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:11,960
巧克力专家斯拉芙和玛利亚不仅要出演一季，
chocolate specialists Slav and Maria are taking on not just one season,

514
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
但是四个都是。
but all four.

515
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,000
我们要做一个有四根树枝的树。
We're going to make a tree which will have four branches.

516
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:19,000
每个分支代表一个季节。有很多事情要做，
Each branch will represent one season. It's quite a lot to do,

517
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,080
所以我认为我们需要努力工作。
so we need to work hard, I think.

OK, what about your moving part?

522
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,880
我们将有一个秋千。
We're going to have a swing.

523

一个什么?摇摆。秋千，秋千。

是的。秋千上的东西?

我要试着做一只鸟。

527
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,640
为什么不呢?
Why not?

528
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
只是内心充满了愤怒。
Just have such a rage inside.

529
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:54,760
试图从昨天的迫降中恢复过来，
Trying to recover from their crash landing yesterday,

530
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,080
WI烹饪学校的凯利和凯蒂也是
The WI Cookery School's Kelly and Katie are also

531
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,440
尝试所有的四季。
attempting all four seasons.

532
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,080
如果这还不够，
And if that wasn't enough,

533
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,440
它们将整合多个活动部件。
they will be incorporating multiple moving parts.

534
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,920
我们有两种机制，
We've got two mechanisms that we're going to be doing,

535
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,360
在冬天，我们有一条传送带，
so in the winter part we've got a conveyor belt,

536
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,080
所以我们要在上面放一些巧克力，
so we'll pop some of our chocolates on it,

537
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,920
它们会旋转。
and they're going to be rotating through.

538
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,080
传送带?是的。
A conveyor belt? Yeah.

539
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,880
有趣,有趣。现在我们来谈谈。是啊!
Interesting, interesting. Now we are talking. Yeah!

540
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,280
它是如何供电的?
How is it going to be powered?

541
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,360
所以这是一个马达，机动机械。
So it's a motor, motorised mechanism.

542
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:25,280
我不得不拆了一辆儿童遥控车。
I had to cannibalise a sort of children's remote-control car.

543
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,920
这是邪恶的。
That is wicked.

544
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,200
他们还计划用他们的糖果开辟一条道路
They also plan to blaze a trail with their bonbons -

545
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,640
黑巧克力味噌焦糖山核桃佛罗伦萨
dark chocolate miso caramel pecan Florentines

546
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:37,320
还有杏蜜百里香甘纳许牛奶巧克力
and apricot and honey thyme ganache milk chocolates

547
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,040
在他们宏伟建筑的底部呼啸而过。
whizzing around the base of their grand structure.

548
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,040
我们的展品是一棵树。
Our showpiece is going to be a tree.

549
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,600
你要怎么让这棵树看起来像真的树?
How you going to make the tree look like a real tree?

550
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,200
凯蒂将负责所有从顶部伸出来的树枝，
Katie is going to be working on all the branches coming out of the top,

551
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,800
她要手工制作。
which she's going to be hand moulding.

552
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,480
然后我们沿着它走下去
And we're going to then go down it

553
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:55,440
用笔触营造出粗糙树皮的效果。
with brushstrokes to give that affect of rough bark.

554
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,960
我们知道还有另外两棵树。
We know that there's two other trees being made.

555
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,720
所以这将是一场战斗。是的。
So it's going to be a fight. Yeah.

556
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,040
厨师们，你们已经有一个小时了，所以还剩下三个小时。
Chefs, you've had an hour, so that's three hours left.

557
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,080
它很快就消失了。
It's gone very, very quickly.

558
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,040
现在我要开始做糖果了。
So now I am going to start the bonbons.

559
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,440
精致的优雅是高端糖果的标志。
Finely tuned elegance is the hallmark of high-end bonbons.

560
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,360
这个是开心果。
This one's going to be pistachio.

561
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:25,160
我会在里面铺上巧克力，放上馅料，然后盖上盖子。
I will line it with chocolate, put the filling, and then cap them.

562
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:29,480
首先，他们必须抛出他们的箱子，箱子应该薄如游丝。
First, they must cast their cases, which should be gossamer thin.

563
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,760
这是一个非常关键的部分，为了得到美味的糖果。
This is a very crucial part, to get the nice bonbon.

564
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,080
已经落山了，这里太冷了。
It's already setting, it's so cold in here.

565
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,760
不过不会太厚，对吧?不。没有?
Not too thick, though, are they? No. No?

566
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,680
但如果见效不够快，
But if they don't work fast enough,

567
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,600
迅速冷却的巧克力在模具里会凝固得太厚。
the rapidly cooling chocolate will set too thick in the mould.

568
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,920
我对这些壳不满意。
I'm not happy with these shells.

569
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,640
我觉得这些都没用。
I don't think we can use any of these.

570
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,200
这不是我们想要的。
This is not what we want.

571
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,920
我们只需要重做一遍，但这让我退缩了。
We just have to redo it again, but it's set me back.

572
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,920
因为你要打磨模具，
Because then you have to polish the mould,

573
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,840
一切都得重新开始。
everything has to start all over again.

574
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,880
这是黑巧克力的外壳。
This is our shell for the dark chocolate.

575
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,040
我对此很满意，
I'm happy with it,

576
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,560
现在我要往里面填上焦糖。
so now I'm going to start filling them up with the caramel.

577
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,640
除了精致的贝壳，
As well as delicately-cast shells,

578
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,280
他们必须巧妙地制作馅料。
they must create fillings with finesse.

579
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:15,160
肉馅饺子出来了。
Cantuccini is coming out.

580
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,240
平衡天堂般的质地和令人垂涎的味道。
Balancing heavenly textures and mouthwatering flavours.

581
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,360
我觉得所有的味道都很不错。
I think all the flavours are quite nice.

582
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,520
覆盆子和柚子清新如春，
Raspberry and yuzu is fresh, like spring,

583
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:26,080
我们还有橘子和肉桂，味道更热一些。
and we have orange and cinnamon, it's a bit more warm.

584
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,560
让我们来看看评委们是怎么说的。
Let's see what the judges say.

585
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:31,400
再加点百里香，还是闻不出来。
Got some more thyme in there, I still can't get the smell.

586
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,680
真的吗?我们用一些非常香的百里香来练习，
Really? We had some very fragrant thyme that we practised with,

587
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,960
这不是很香。不。
and this is not so fragrant. No.

588
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,640
我在做覆盆子巧克力酱，
I'm piping raspberry ganache,

589
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,040
把它放在焦糖百香果上面。
which is going to sit on top of passion fruit of caramel.

590
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,440
先是甜的，然后是酸的。
It's sweet and then sour.

591
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:47,040
开心果是世界上最好的开心果，当然产自伊朗。
Pistachios are finest pistachios in the world, from Iran, of course.

592
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,520
当他们咬进去的时候，那不是巧克力酱，
When they bite into it, it's just not ganache,

593
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,360
它们也会有一些嘎吱声。
they're going to have some crunch as well.

594
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,520
马希德，你还没在里面放巧克力呢。
Mahshid, you haven't even lined it with chocolate yet.

595
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,480
至少放点巧克力进去吧。是的。
At least put chocolate in it. Yeah.

596
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,400
所以，我只是盖上松露。
So, I'm just capping the truffles.

597
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:04,560
然后我们就可以吃柠檬了
So then we can just have, like, lemons

598
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,440
下面是柑橘类水果。
and, like, citrus fruits at the bottom.

599
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,600
糖果密封……
Bonbons sealed...

600
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,920
他们看起来不错。
They are looking good.

601
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,760
. .和设置…在冰箱里。
..and setting... In the fridge.

602
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:18,520
是时候在黄金时刻发现昨天的辛勤工作了
It's time to discover if yesterday's hard work in the golden hour

603
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,920
有了回报。
has paid off.

604
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,000
这是怎么回事?哦，看起来真漂亮。
How's that? Oh, that looks beautiful.

605
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,160
哪儿也不动。
Not moving anywhere.

606
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
恰到好处，恰到好处。
Properly set, properly.

607
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,520
可能是脆弱的。
Can be fragile.

608
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,840
隔夜冷却收缩的巧克力……
Chocolate that's cooled and contracted overnight...

609
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,280
哎呀!
Whoops!

610
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,840
. .是非常微妙的。
..is extremely delicate.

611
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
它不会破裂。幸运的是我昨天做了一个备用的，
It cannot crack. Luckily I did a spare one yesterday,

612
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,880
我觉得这是件好事。
I think it was a good thing.

613
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,240
我试着把积木移开，
I'm trying to remove the blocks,

614
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,800
不要认为他们会以某种方式出来。
don't think they're going to come out somehow.

615
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,680
巧克力需要热一下。
The chocolate needs to warm up a bit.

616
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,320
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

617
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,880
是的。哔哔声。
Yeah. BLEEP.

618
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,240
他们的活动部件牢牢地卡住了……
With their moving part firmly stuck...

619
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,920
这是目前可能发生的最糟糕的事情。
It's just the worst thing that could happen right now.

620
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,320
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

621
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,640
. .艾迪和马希德又落后了。
..Eddie and Mahshid have fallen behind again.

622
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,320
这是一场噩梦。
This is a nightmare.

623
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,320
大厨们，你们还有两个小时!两个小时!
Chefs, you have two hours left! Two hours!

624
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,880
发出哔哔声
BLEEPING

625
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,840
我们要尽快开始组装零件。
As soon as possible, we're going to start to assemble the piece.

626
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,880
这件事越早越好。
The earlier the better on this one.

627
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:25,000
虽然大多数球队都开始带来他们的四季秀
While most teams are starting to bring their Four Seasons showpieces

628
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,920
在一起…
together...

629
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,720
看起来怎么样?美丽的,伴侣。
How's that looking? Beautiful, mate.

630
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,960
. .埃迪和马希德失去了宝贵的时间
..Eddie and Mahshid have lost valuable time

631
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,520
挣扎在破碎的树干上
struggling with their cracked tree trunk.

632
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,800
我不希望我最大的敌人也这样。
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.

633
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:43,080
我们在萨沃伊的朋友，他们倾尽全力
Our friends at the Savoy - they're throwing everything

634
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,600
他们已经完成了他们的示范挑战，
they've got at their showpiece challenge and,

635
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:48,320
嗯，他们最好是!
er, they better be!

636
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:52,000
埃迪挣扎着把抽屉拿出来，他们可能会发现
Eddie struggled to extract those drawers and they may be finding

637
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,840
他们自己其实有麻烦。
themselves actually in trouble.

638
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,040
我们可以纠正这一点。
We can rectify this.

639
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,440
我真的没有选择。我们必须能够做到这一点。
Don't really have a choice. We've got to be able to do it.

640
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,720
我们来自WI的女士们…
Our ladies from the WI...

641
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,840
它们在一棵树上有四季。我是说，这很有趣。
They've four seasons in one tree. I mean, it's interesting.

642
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,280
我喜欢传送带的想法，
I like the conveyor belt idea,

643
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,680
但他们真的能实现吗?
but could they actually bring it to fruition?

644
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,400
是的。我们不知道。
Yeah. We don't know.

645
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,320
琳恩和罗曼。
Leanne and Romain.

646
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,840
他们在春天工作，他们会带着小蜜蜂和蜂箱来。
They're working with spring and they are going to bring the little bees with the beehives.

647
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,200
哦，我喜欢!Bzzz !
Oh, I like that! Bzzz!

648
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,840
我们保存了它。而且，一旦这一切都安排好了，
We saved it. And besides, once this is all set around here,

649
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,880
然后它会在外面形成结构，然后就没有了
then it'll give it that structure on the outside and there won't be any

650
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,680
更多的错误。
more faults.

651
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,280
我们只能全速工作了。
We'll just have to work at full speed.

652
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:34,480
大厨们，你们还有一个小时。一个小时。
Chefs, you have one hour left. One hour.

653
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,560
它是碱。它必须支撑其他所有人的重量，
It's the base. It'll have to support the weight of all the rest,

654
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,600
所以它必须足够坚固。
so it needs to be strong enough.

655
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,960
我在上面打了些小结，让树皮看起来更粗糙。
I've carved little knots out, just to give that effect of rough bark.

656
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,360
现在不像电线杆了。
Less like a telegraph pole now.

657
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,360
凯莉，你能处理这个吗?我来搞定。
Kelly, can you handle this? I've got this.

658
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,080
我觉得你处理不了……
I don't think you can handle this...

659
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,880
不，我觉得你能处理好!
No, I do think you can handle this!

660
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,760
为他们的四季展示品注入活力……
Breathing life into their Four Seasons showpieces...

661
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
我们使用管道滞后来创建分支。
We're using pipe lagging to create branches.

662
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,200
它撑不住的。这个撑不住。
It won't hold. This one won't hold.

663
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,800
那很好……将取决于他们精确繁殖的能力吗
That's fine. ..will rest on their ability to accurately reproduce

664
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,200
自然界的颜色和纹理。
the colours and textures found in nature.

665
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,560
花是我最担心的事。
The flower's the thing that's worrying me the most.

666
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,040
我们想证明我们可以做到，而且它们看起来很漂亮。
We want to show that we can do them and they do look nice.

667
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,080
这些花看起来很漂亮，各位!
These flowers look beautiful, everyone!

668
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,800
他们也很危险地靠近边缘——我只是想说。
They're also precariously near the edge - I'm just going to say that.

669
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:22,520
花在边上。它在边缘。
The flowers are on the edge. It's on the edge.

670
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,240
我觉得罗曼也是这样。
I feel like that's the way Romain is as well.

671
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,880
一旦它凝固，你可以很容易地取出真正的叶子。
Once it sets, you can easily remove the actual leaf.

672
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,840
剩下的是叶子的背面，它会给巧克力带来很好的效果。
You're left with the back side of the leaf and it gives a nice effect on the chocolate.

673
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,240
该死的你!
Damn you!

674
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,360
这些花不开花。哔哔声!
These blossoms aren't working. BLEEP this!

675
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,960
我可能会暂时忘记这些。
I might just forget about these for a minute.

676
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,240
大厨们，你们还有30分钟。
Chefs, you have 30 minutes left.

677
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,600
唷!
Phew!

678
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:50,920
现在我在制作冬天。我觉得我有点紧张，
Now I'm making winter. I think I'm a bit stressed,

679
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,160
因为我们有很多元素要完成。
because we have so many elements to complete.

680
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,520
哦,哔哔声!
Oh, BLEEP!

681
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,360
来吧!
Come on!

682
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,600
你会掉下去吗?嗯?
Are you going to fall? Huh?

683
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:06,080
不，我在跟这个说话。
No, I was talking to this.

684
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:07,280
艾迪，你的围裙真棒!
Eddie, great apron!

685
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:09,320
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

686
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,720
我想我们需要给它涂上一层。否则，它看起来会很奇怪。那么，一切都是绿色的吗?
I think we're going to need to coat it. Otherwise, it's going to look odd. Everything green, then?

687
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:21,200
好吧，但是请保留……最后是黑色的?最后是黑色。
OK, but just keep the... The end black? The end black.

688
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,360
大厨们，你们还有十分钟。
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

689
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,040
那是十分钟。
That's ten minutes.

690
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,520
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

691
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,600
不!温柔。这就是为什么我们要温柔。
No! Gentle. This is why we have to be gentle.

692
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,600
哔哔声的缘故!我正在荡秋千，
BLEEP sake! I'm doing the swing now,

693
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,960
也就是我们的移动物体。
which is going to be our moving object.

694
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,720
我没有时间去执行我原来的计划。
I don't have the time to execute what I originally planned.

695
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,880
啊!
Ah!

696
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,280
蜂巢一直在响。
The beehive keeps cracking.

697
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,200
它没有像我们希望的那样平滑地融合在一起。
It's not coming together as smooth as we wanted it to.

698
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,080
我们会有办法的。
We'll manage something.

699
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,640
我很担心这个秋千。小心，它在撕裂。
I'm worried about this swing. Careful, it's ripping there.

700
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
哎呀!
Whoops!

701
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,000
报警哔哔声
ALARM BEEPS

702
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,400
等待,等待。先把刀刃戴上。
Wait, wait. Put the edge on first.

703
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,720
温柔。
Gentle.

704
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,720
没关系。
That's OK.

705
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,280
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

706
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,680
那是五分钟。
That's five minutes.

707
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,040
瞧!
Voila!

708
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,160
我对这些照片出来的方式不满意，
I'm not happy with the way that these ones have come out,

709
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,080
但我们没有足够的时间重做。
but we don't have enough time to redo.

710
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
看看这些坏男孩!
Look at them bad boys!

711
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,640
把它剪掉。
Just cut it.

712
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,960
春天的草。
Spring grass.

713
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,040
我要把巧克力上面的坚果拧开。
I'm just going to nut the top of the chocolates.

714
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,080
我想我现在没有足够的时间做这件事，但我会努力的。
I don't think I have enough time to do this now, but I will try.

715
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:54,880
就是这样。好了，我的传送带坏了。
That's it. Right, my conveyor belt, it's not working.

716
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,360
哦,哔哔声!是土壤的问题，是齿轮的问题。
Oh, BLEEP! It's the soil, yeah, it's in the cogs.

717
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,120
只要快点把抽屉收拾好就行了。
Just got to do these drawers quick and that's it.

718
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,120
错误的大小。
Wrong size.

719
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,400
哔哔声!你能用巧克力再做一条吗，
BLEEP! Can you make another strip with the chocolate,

720
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,040
接下来我们可以剪另一个抽屉吗?
so we can cut the other drawer next?

721
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,960
哔哔声!两条巧克力。
BLEEP! Two strips of chocolate.

722
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,240
大厨们，你们有一分钟的时间完成你们的表演。
Chefs, you have one minute to complete your Showpieces.

723
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,520
给我喷雾。
Give me the spray.

724
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,400
有东西咔哒一声响了。
Something just went click.

725
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:22,840
哦，好了。它看起来像哔哔声，但它是某种东西。
Oh, there we go. It's going to look like BLEEP, but it's something.

726
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,160
至少看看能不能在里面放一个抽屉。
At least see if we can get one drawer in there.

727
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,200
只要合适就行。不适合那里。
As long as it fits. Not fitting in there.

728
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,960
哔哔声!要我帮你吗?
BLEEP! Do you want me to give you a hand?

729
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,320
事实上，不，我很好。你是好吗?是的，我知道了。
Actually, no, I'm good. You're good? Yeah, I've got this.

730
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
时间到了，大厨们!
Time's up, chefs!

731
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:40,280
Showpiece的挑战到此结束。
That is the end of the Showpiece challenge.

732
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,520
做得好!嘿，过来，我们做得很好。
Well done! Hey, come here, we've done all right.

733
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,240
你成功了吗?
Did you manage?

734
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,560
它很好。很好。做得很好。
It's nice. It's good. Well done.

735
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,320
哔哔声!看看其他人的。
BLEEP! Look at everybody else's.

736
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,160
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

737
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:55,120
如此美丽。我真的很喜欢这个绿色的。
So beautiful. I really like this green one.

738
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,160
是的。他们的树太美了!我喜欢他们的树。
Yeah. Their tree is BLEEP beautiful! I like their tree.

739
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,760
它甚至比我们在实践中做的还要好。
It's even better than what we did in practice.

740
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,520
我想说，我们的看起来太酷了!
Can I just say, ours looks so damn cool!

741
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,560
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

742
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,040
四个非凡的四季展示在短短五个小时内完成。
Four extraordinary Four Seasons Showpieces made in just five hours.

743
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,960
但是谁做了足够的努力来赢得他们在6强中的位置呢?
But who has done enough to earn their place in the final six?

744
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,560
建筑本身看起来非常优雅。
The structure itself looks really elegant.

745
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,920
你的花很漂亮
Your flower is very pretty

746
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,160
你的蜜蜂给你的展览带来了一点活力。
and your bee bring a little bit life into your Showpiece.

747
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,360
这对我来说很神奇。我觉得你已经搞定了。
It's very magical for me. I think you've nailed this one.

748
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,920
你交付的东西在视觉上很吸引人
You've delivered something which is visually attractive

749
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,480
和平衡。
and well-balanced.

750
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,920
但是，就在中间，你有橡皮筋，
But, right in the middle, you've got the elastic band,

751
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,560
这对你的演讲有点不利。
which is defeating a little bit your presentation.

752
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,560
不过，还不错。
But, not bad.

753
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,200
巧克力呢?
What about the chocolates?

754
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,760
我真的很喜欢你对细节的关注
I really like the attention to detail

755
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,920
它完成得非常整齐。
and it's very neatly finished.

756
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:04,320
我们有白巧克力、覆盆子和柚子。
We have a white chocolate, raspberry and yuzu.

757
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,960
我喜欢你做的巧克力的口感。
I like the texture of your chocolate.

758
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,680
我觉得柚子比覆盆子更有味道。
I feel the yuzu more than the raspberry.

759
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,080
这里需要覆盆子吗?不太确定。
Is the raspberry needed here? Not too sure.

760
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,920
当我品尝这个的时候，没有什么能让我兴奋的，
When I taste this, there's nothing to excite me,

761
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,520
这只是一种质地。
it's just one texture.

762
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,640
再提醒我一遍，里面是什么?
Remind me again, what's in there?

763
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:21,120
橘子和肉桂。你的甘那许完全是颗粒状的。
Orange and cinnamon. Your ganache is completely grainy.

764
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,760
我甚至都不想尝是否有橙子，这让我很反感。
I don't even want to taste whether there's orange, it just put me off.

765
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,560
所以我希望你在饮食元素上多下点功夫。
So I'd like you to put more effort into the eating element.

766
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,120
谢谢你！谢谢你！
Thank you. Thank you.

767
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,840
是我的错，琳恩，对不起!
It's my fault, Leanne, I'm sorry!

768
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,720
又是巧克力酱。
It was the ganache again.

769
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,320
我感觉到了秋天，一些漂亮的小树叶。
I feel the autumn, some nice little leaves.

770
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:50,440
你给我们展示一些技术。
You show us some technical skill.

771
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,520
然而，我认为它不优雅，不适合我。
However, I think it's not elegant, it's not well done for me.

772
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:56,880
我们要的是一个活动部件。
We were asking for a moving part.

773
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,640
把它拿出来，里面还有一些糖果。
This comes out and you've got a couple more bonbons inside there.

774
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,040
啊，真感人。是的。
Ah, that's moving. Yeah.

775
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,560
那个洞里是不是还有一个移动的部件?
Was there meant to be another moving part in that hole as well?

776
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,240
是的，但我最后一刻弄坏了一个。
Yes, but I broke one last minute.

777
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,400
所以这是一个。这是一个小鸟巢。
So instead this is a... It's a little bird's nest.

778
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,280
这是一个小鸟巢，啊!我们来尝尝吧?
It's a little bird's nest, ah! Shall we taste?

779
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,840
红色的是柚子果酱
So the red one is grapefruit marmalade

780
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,920
还有葡萄柚和杜松子酱。
and grapefruit and gin ganache.

781
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,480
从视觉上看，我觉得很不错，
Visually, I think that it's quite nice,

782
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:21,080
但是，我觉得巧克力太浓了。
however, I think the chocolate is too thick.

783
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,440
杜松子酒在巧克力酱里?
The gin is in the ganache?

784
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,960
是的。我只得到柚子。
Yes. I get only the grapefruit.

785
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,520
好的，那另一个呢?
OK, what about the other one?

786
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,600
绿色的是开心果甘纳许，里面有结晶的开心果。
The green one is pistachio ganache with crystallised pistachios inside.

787
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,240
这是一种很好的巧克力。
It's a nice chocolate.

788
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:34,600
开心果的味道还在。
The pistachio flavour is present.

789
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,480
我也很喜欢你的坚果结晶，
I really like you crystallised your nuts as well,

790
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,400
这是一个不同的维度。
and this give a different dimension.

791
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,800
所以在两个夹心之间，有很好的电位。
So between the two bonbons, good potential.

792
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,200
嗯,是的。
Mmm, yes.

793
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,520
干得好，伙计们。
Well done, guys.

794
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,120
很好。嗯。
It's good. Mmm.

795
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,800
我现在只想哭。
I just wanna cry now.

796
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,080
从视觉上看，我觉得它很停滞。
Visually, it looks very stagnant to me.

797
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,360
没有运动，没有曲线，没有生命。
There's no movement, there's no curve, there's no life in there.

798
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,480
我还希望你在收尾的时候更有技巧呢。
I was hoping that you'd have more finesse in the finishing touch.

799
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,960
活动部分在哪里?
Where is the moving part?

800
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,680
运动的部分在这里。
The moving part is here.

801
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,680
笑声
LAUGHTER

802
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,040
你必须做得更好!
You have to do better than that!

803
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:23,240
Showpieces只是缺少一点专业技能。
The Showpieces is just lacking a bit of the professional skills.

804
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,760
我们想多看一点。
We want to see a bit more.

805
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,360
小心你的手指。
Careful, your finger.

806
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,760
我们这里有一个白巧克力外壳，
So we have a white chocolate shell here,

807
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,600
还有磨碎的咖啡和爱尔兰奶油甘纳许，还有意式脆饼。
with grinded coffee and Irish cream ganache, and there is biscotti.

808
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,600
最美妙的是你加入了一些磨碎的咖啡
The most beautiful thing is that you incorporate some of grounded coffee

809
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,960
放进你的白巧克力里。
into your white chocolate.

810
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:43,280
非常漂亮，味道非常棒，
It's absolutely beautiful, the flavour profile is stunning,

811
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,840
但如果你拿出一个有这么厚外壳的糖果，
but if you present a bonbon which has a shell that thick,

812
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,720
乐趣消失了，是吗?
the pleasure is going, yeah?

813
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,320
这个怎么样?百香果焦糖，
What about this one? Passion fruit caramel,

814
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,000
黑巧克力和覆盆子甘纳许。
dark chocolate and raspberry ganache.

815
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,840
味道很浓，很干净。
Flavours really strong, really clean.

816
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:58,960
我会选择把覆盆子和百香果放在一起吗?
Would I have chosen to put raspberry and passion fruit together?

817
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,880
不。我本可以好好享受的
No. I could have enjoyed it beautifully

818
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,080
只要你的激情焦糖。
just on your passion caramel.

819
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,280
是啊，就像你把两个不同的糖果放在一起。是的。
Yeah, it's like you've got two different bonbons in one. Yeah.

820
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,000
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

821
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,600
四季在哪里?我在上面只能看到两个季节。
Where is the four seasons? I only can see two seasons up there.

822
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:33,360
上面只有两个，我们没有时间做另一边。
There's only two up there, we didn't get time to do the other side.

823
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,080
所以它还没完成?
So it's unfinished?

824
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,760
我觉得对我来说有点裸露。
I think it's a little bit bare for me.

825
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:40,920
里面没有生命。
There is no life in it.

826
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,960
它基本上是一根杆子，上面覆盖着巧克力，
It's a pole, basically, covered with chocolate,

827
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,080
我们不要拐弯抹角了。
let's not beat around the bush.

828
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,560
请带我们去看你们的活动部件好吗?
Could you please take us to your moving parts?

829
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,000
这里有传送带，
So we've got the conveyor belt here,

830
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,000
然后我们在弹簧部分也有转盘。
and then we've also got the turntable in the spring section.

831
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,080
我真的很喜欢这个小家伙。
I really enjoy that little fellow here.

832
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,120
向上、向下。你这样看——砰!
Up, down. You see like that - bop!

833
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,600
哦，他走了。就像……
Oh, he's gone. It's almost like...

834
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,600
防喷器!这是一种努力，你们已经想过了。
Bop! There is an effort, you guys have thought about it.

835
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:06,200
那么我们可爱的巧克力都有哪些口味呢?
So what kind of flavours do we have in our lovely chocolates?

836
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:07,520
我们准备了杏果胶，
We've got an apricot gel,

837
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,000
蜂窝状的蜂巢和蜂蜜加百里香的甘纳许。
a clustered honeycomb and a honey and thyme-infused ganache.

838
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,560
好的，从视觉上看，巧克力不是很好调和的，
OK, visually, that chocolate is not well-tempered,

839
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,560
我可以看到这里有很多点。
I can see lots of dots over here.

840
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,560
我喜欢它的质地。
One thing I like here is the texture.

841
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:21,600
我非常非常喜欢这个蜂巢酥。
That honeycomb crumble I really, really love.

842
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,640
这里有可能做出美味的巧克力
There's potential to do a nice chocolate here

843
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,760
但现在还没有。下一个?
but it's not there yet. Next one?

844
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:29,360
味噌焦糖，我们还做了佛罗伦萨山核桃。
Miso caramel, and we've also made a pecan Florentine in there.

845
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,960
小心你的手指!选角比补牙更重要。
Careful your fingers! Your casting is more than your filling.

846
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,080
我很难尝出味噌的味道。
I'm struggling to taste the miso.

847
00:43:36,120 --> 00:43:38,480
一切对我来说都不平衡。
Everything just doesn't balance up for me.

848
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,920
你今天已经尽力了
You've done what you could today,

849
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,480
让我们看看这是否足够让你进入下一轮。
let's see if it's enough to take you through the next round.

850
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,720
也许我们应该只拍一季。
Perhaps we should have just done one season.

851
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:58,320
根据他们在两项挑战中的表现，
Based on their performance across both challenges,

852
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,400
评委们将对参赛队伍进行排名，
the judges will now rank the teams,

853
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:04,880
只有前三名才能进入六强。
and only the top three will take their place in the final six.

854
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:08,280
颜色很漂亮，不是吗?是的，你能感受到这首曲子的能量。
Nice colour, isn't it? Yeah, you can feel the energy in the piece.

855
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,560
我们对他们的评论非常满意。
We're actually really happy with their comments.

856
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:12,120
他们很喜欢我们的巧克力，
They really liked our chocolates,

857
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,920
尽管糖果不是最好的。
even though the bonbon was not the best.

858
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,840
这里……我们希望能走得更远，
And here... We would like to go as far as we can,

859
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:19,080
但我觉得我们的表演……
but I don't feel like our performance...

860
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,880
是的。. .就是这么高的标准。
Yeah. ..was that high standard.

861
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,400
我们对我们创造的最终结果不是特别满意，
We weren't particularly happy with the end result of what we created,

862
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,920
巧克力，我想大家都知道，
and chocolate, I think everybody knows now,

863
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:29,600
不是我的强项!
is not my strongest point!

864
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:33,720
凌乱…你绝对不想参加一场失败的比赛。
It's untidy... You never want to enter a competition to fail.

865
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:36,800
我们努力工作，度过了许多不眠之夜。
We worked so hard, we have had so many sleepless nights.

866
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,160
我们很乐意经历并展示我们是什么做的
We would love to go through and show what we're made of

867
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,440
展示更多我们能做的事情。
and show a bit more of what we can do.

868
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:48,600
Benoit和珍惜已经做出了决定。
Benoit and Cherish have made their decision.

869
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:51,880
第一名的队伍展示了非凡的技术
The team in first place showed exceptional technique

870
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:54,560

第二名是R巧克力公司的斯拉夫和玛丽亚。

恭喜你，我们也会再见到你。

876
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,200
那就剩下WI烹饪学校的凯莉和凯蒂了

877
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,040
还有萨沃伊的艾迪和马希德。
and Eddie and Mashid from the Savoy.

878
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,680
经过深思熟虑，
After much deliberation,

879
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:22,000
伯努瓦和珍爱同意了
Benoit and Cherish agreed

880
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:25,000
今晚要退出比赛的队伍是…

881
00:45:29,720 --> 00:45:31,120
. .凯莉和凯蒂。
..Kelly and Katie.

882
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,240
我想我们已经为自己感到骄傲了。
I think we've done ourselves proud.

883
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:37,960
我为我们所做的一切感到无比自豪。
I'm incredibly proud of what we've done.

884
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,880
对不起!哦，不，不用，没事的。
Sorry! Oh, no, don't be, it's fine.

885
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,000
这是一个非常积极的过程，不是吗?
It's just been such a positive process, hasn't it?

886
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,040
它有。我们曾经是朋友，现在是最好的朋友。
It has. We were mates, we're now best mates.

887
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,360
是啊，我们现在是闺蜜了。所以你还想要什么?
Yeah, we are besties now. So what more can you want?

888
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,600
说法语
SPEAKS FRENCH

889
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,000

我们很高兴。

在这场比赛中前进是一种奇妙的感觉。

我们会遇到新的朋友，新的竞争对手。

今晚先庆祝一下，然后继续工作。

下次，空气中弥漫着爱。
Next time, love is in the air.

898
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,120
你想把早餐放在床上，是吗?
You want the breakfast in the bed, yeah?

899
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,520
你是说就我们俩吗?
You mean just the two of us?

900
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,360
但有人会羡慕维也纳音乐界的维纳斯吗?
But will anyone wow the Venus of Viennoiserie?

901
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,800
天哪，你能听到吗?
CRACKING Oh, my goodness, can you hear that?

902
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:20,320
在全糖秀品中闪耀?

905
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,680
它在倾斜，不是吗?

906
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,920

将彼此第一次见面，组成最后的六强

这周是浪漫周。
and this week is romance week.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,600
喘气:哦，我的天哪!利亚姆，你觉得他们会坠入爱河吗!
GASPS: Oh, my goodness! Liam, do you think they're gonna fall in love?!

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:15,600
不。这就是挑战的主题。
No. That's just the theme of the challenges.

7
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,760
哦，我打赌他们会的。
Oh, I bet they will, though.

8
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
它们有如此多的共同点——然而它们又是死对头。
They've got so much in common - and yet they're deadly rivals.

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,440
就像罗密欧与朱丽叶
It's gonna be like Romeo and Juliet -

10
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,840
厨房地板对面的禁忌之爱!
forbidden love across the kitchen floor!

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,200
忽略他。因此，我死于一块蛋糕。
Ignore him. Thus, with a cake I die.

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,160
欢迎回到《职业烘焙大赛》。
And welcome back to Bake Off: The Professionals.

14
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,600

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,920
我在做什么?
What am I doing?

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,280
. .而萨沃伊的艾迪和马希德有严重的时间问题…
..whilst the Savoy's Eddie and Mahshid had serious timing issues...

21
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,960
三个半小时，我很不高兴。
With three and a half hour, I'm not happy about it.

22

. .但是，是夏威夷州烹饪学校的凯蒂和凯利推翻了……
..but it was the WI cookery school's Katie and Kelly who toppled...

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,000
啊!
Argh!

24
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,080
从竞争中脱颖而出。
..from the competition.

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,080
现在，空气中弥漫着爱的气息……
Now, love is in the air...

26
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,240
因为发出哔哔声。
Cos BLEEP.

27
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,480
绝对的哔哔声。
Absolute BLEEP.

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,160
. .但评委们是否会为早餐糕点而倾倒?
..but will the judges fall for breakfast pastries...

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,240
. .沉醉于浪漫的糖果秀?
..and swoon over romantic sugar showpieces?

30
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,440
哦，啦，啦，啦，啦!
Oh, la, la, la, la!

31
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,000
只有五个四分之一决赛名额可供争夺……
With only five quarterfinal places up for grabs...

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,240
这是唯一的机会。
It's one chance only.

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,560
. .谁会承诺…
..who will be on a promise...

34
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,440
你想在床上吃早餐，是吗?
You wanted breakfast in the bed, yeah?

35
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,240
. .谁的心会破碎?
..and whose hearts will be broken?

36
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,840
别操之过急啊。
Don't bloody rush it for the sake of it.

37
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:26,720
一定是爱，爱，爱。＃
# It must be love, love, love. #

欢迎回来，大厨们，
Welcome back, chefs,

45
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,760
恭喜你们进入了六强。
and congratulations on making it to the final six.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:06,440
因为这周的主题是浪漫，
Now, because this week's theme is romance,

47
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,760
评委们决定测试一下你的法式蛋糕
the judges have decided to test you on the patisserie

48
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,840
他们最热衷的。
they are most passionate about.

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,920
Benoit和珍惜想让你做两种维也纳杂音
Benoit and Cherish would like you to make two types of Viennoiserie -

50
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,480
或者像大多数人所说的早餐糕点。
or breakfast pastries, as most people call them.

51
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,320
我要你做24个完美的羊角面包。
I want you to make 24 perfectly executed croissants.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,960
它必须是黄油状的，片状的，而且一模一样。
It has to be buttery, flaky and identical.

53
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,800
我非常喜欢牛角面包。
I am very passionate about croissants.

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,560
亲爱的，我可以这么叫你吗?
Now, Benoisserie, may I call you that?

55
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,120
不。对不起，伯努瓦。
No. I'm sorry, Benoit.

56
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,440
您想让厨师准备什么?
What would you like the chefs to prepare?

57
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,800
我们从未见过的24件维也纳杂音作品。
24 Viennoiserie creations, that we've never seen before.

58
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,720
一部分是维也纳的喧闹，另一部分是完全不同的东西。
Part Viennoiserie, part something else altogether.

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,440
我为维也纳的喧闹而疯狂，我希望你也能疯狂一点。
I'm crazy for Viennoiseries and I'd like you to get a little crazy, too.

60
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,920
厨师们，你们昨晚只有30分钟准备，
Chefs, you had 30 minutes last night to prepare,

61
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:55,360
你们有三个半小时来完成今天的挑战。
and you have three and a half hours to complete today's challenge.

62
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,160
祝你好运，从现在开始。
Good luck, and your time starts now.

63
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,080
你在用哪个炉子?
Which stove are you using?

64
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,200
第一个炉子是丹麦的。
Stove one is the Danish.

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,680
另一个是羊角面包。
The other one is the croissants.

66
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,560
就是这里。我们选出了最后的六支队伍。
This is it. We've got the final six teams.

67
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,480
有了维也纳杂音乐团的创作，
With the Viennoiserie creation,

68
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,600
我们想让他们用经典的维也纳杂音
we want them to use a classic Viennoiserie -

69
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,800
把它和任何你想要的东西混在一起，重新创造一个新的。
mix it up with anything you want, and recreate a new one.

70
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,560
所以，我可以给你，比如，doissant -
So, I could give you, for example, the doissant -

71
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,960
这是一个甜甜圈和牛角包的组合。
which is a combination of a doughnut and a croissant.

72
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
你得想个办法
You have to come up with something

73
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,360
我们希望我们能考虑到。
we wished we would have thought about.

74
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,120
除了发明了一种独创的早餐糕点，
As well as inventing an original breakfast pastry,

75
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,440
这些团队还必须应对不断的折叠和冷却
the teams will also have to juggle the constant folding and chilling

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,360
这是制作经典羊角面包的必备条件。
required to perfect the dough for a classic croissant.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,480
我在找什么
What I'm looking for

78
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:39,560
尝起来一定是黄油味的。
is that it has to be buttery when you taste.

79
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,080
它必须是片状的，
It has to be flaky,

80
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,400
层压必须突出和精确
and the lamination has to be prominent and precise -

81
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,840
当我切开羊角面包时，
and, when I cut through the croissant,

82
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,480
我喜欢看到这种美丽的蜂窝状纹理。
I like to see this beautiful honeycomb texture.

83
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:56,000
这看起来很简单，但要做到完美需要很高的技术。
It seems simple, but it is very technical to get it perfect.

84
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,560
覆膜，定型，发酵和烘烤两种糕点
Laminating, shaping, proving and baking two pastries

85
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,760
只需要三个半小时
in just three and a half hours

86
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,000
将要求团队小心地管理繁重的工作量。
will require the teams to manage their heavy workload carefully.

87
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,600
我只是在分配奶油蛋卷
I'm just portioning up the brioche

88
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,920
这样我就能尽快把它放到证明中。
so I can get this in the prover as quick as possible.

89
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,000
马希德已经开始做羊角面包了。
Mahshid's already started the croissants.

90
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,360
和我们大多数团队一样，
Like most of our teams,

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,280
艾迪和马希德来自伦敦举世闻名的萨沃伊酒店
Eddie and Mahshid from London's world-famous Savoy Hotel

92
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,120
我不习惯完美的维也纳音乐。
aren't used to perfecting Viennoiseries.

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,320
你们酒店里经常做羊角面包吗?
Do you guys make croissants a lot in the hotel?

94
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,960
不是我们，是面包师。
We don't, no, the bakers do.

95
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,560
怎么啦？怎么啦？还有别的队伍?
What? What? There's another team?

96
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,280
是的。那么，你整天都在做什么?
Yeah. So, what you do all day?

97
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,720
我们做糕点。我不知道这有什么区别。
We do the pastries. I didn't know there was a difference.

98
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,680
维也纳杂音乐团的创作，你为我们准备了什么?
So, Viennoiserie creation, what have you prepared for us?

99
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
我们要做一个briole。
We're gonna do a briole.

100
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,320
Briole。一半是奶油蛋卷，一半是泡芙。
Briole. It's half brioche and half profiterole.

101
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,640
艾迪的briole会有奶油蛋糕底，
Eddie's briole will have a brioche base,

102
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,080
泡芙酥皮，
a choux pastry top,

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
里面有榛子慕斯
filled with hazelnut mousseline

104
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,440
用碎坚果装饰
and decorated with crushed nuts

105
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,200
还有黑巧克力蛋糕。
and dark chocolate craquelin.

106
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,760
你怎么把泡芙糕点放在奶油蛋卷里?
How do you place your choux pastry in your brioche?

107
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,080
我们先证明一下奶油蛋卷，
So, we prove the brioche first,

108
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,200
然后我们要把泡芙糕点拌料倒进去，
and then we're going to pipe in our choux pastry mix,

109
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,800
然后在上面放上一层石蜡。
and then on top, it gets the craquelin.

110
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,440
谁创造了这个?
And who created this?

111
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,720
嗯，是的。你们俩都创造了?
Er, we did. You created, both of you?

112
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,960
是啊，我们只是想出了不同的办法。天啊!
Yeah, we just came up with something different. Gosh!

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,480
这可能是个不错的发明，不是吗?
Might be a good invention, isn't it?

114
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,360
这完全是我们想要的——尝试一些不同的东西
It is completely what we were asking for - try something different -

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,960
这可能是我们以前从未见过的。
something we potentially haven't seen before.

116
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
是的。
Yeah.

117
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,480
虽然想象力是维也纳噪音艺术创作的关键……
While imagination is key for the Viennoiserie creation...

118
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,400
我们需要想出一些不同的办法
We need come up with something different

119
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,920
还没有发明出来。
which hasn't been invented.

120
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,080
. .制作经典羊角面包，必须遵循严格的流程。
..for the classic croissant, a strict path has to be followed.

121
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,840
原料简单，所以过程很重要。
Simple ingredients, so process is important.

122
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,400
你的黄油怎么样?
How is your butter?

123
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
看起来有点软。
It seems a bit soft.

124
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,200
如果黄油在揉成面团时太热，
If the butter is too warm when it is folded into the dough,

125
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,560
在烘焙过程中，它会从糕点中漏出来
during baking, it will leak out of the pastry

126
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,760
导致层压坍塌。
causing layers of lamination to collapse.

127
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,840
太冷的话，它不会扩散到面团的边缘，
Too cold and it won't spread to the edges of the dough,

128
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,440
留下没有任何层压的区域。
leaving areas that won't have any lamination at all.

129
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,320
这一点都不好。
This is not good at all.

130
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,880
你量体温了吗?
Did you take the temperatures?

131
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,240
不。我说:“我们需要测量温度。”
No. I said, "We need to take the temperatures."

132
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,760
因为这里有很多面团
Cos there's all this dough here -

133
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,840
所有这些面团，
all this dough here,

134
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,440
黄油没有完全卷进去。我很抱歉。
and the butter's not been folded in properly. I'm sorry.

135
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,440
黄油和面团的温度不一样。
The temperature of my butter and the dough are not the same.

136
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,560
我忘记检查温度了。
I forgot to check the temperature.

137
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,520
我刚开始埋头苦干
I just started folding in,

138
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,360
所以，正如你所看到的，
and so, as you can see,

139
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,240
我们有很多面团，黄油粘在中间。
we have a lot of dough, and the butter's stuck in the middle.

140
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,160
它们不会起作用的。我可以告诉你。
They're not going to work. I can tell you that.

141
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,080
这些会很糟糕。
These are going to be bad.

142
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,440
他们会很哔哔的。
They're gonna be really BLEEP.

143
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,000
因为做得不对，
Because it's not been done properly,

144
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,600
我们没时间再做一个新的了。
and we don't have time to make a new one.

145
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,880
斯拉夫是豪华巧克力制作团队“我们的巧克力”的队长，
Slav, captain of the luxury chocolatier team, Our Chocolate,

146
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,320
也在挣扎。
is also struggling.

147
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,160
我有点担心这个。
I'm a bit worried about this.

148
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,960
看起来有点软。
It seems a bit soft.

149
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,560
我要放到冰箱里。
I'm gonna put in the fridge.

150
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,240
如果每次都让黄油融化，
If the butter is allowed to melt during each time-consuming turn,

151
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,480
一层层的面团会混合在一起，破坏任何分层的机会。
the layers of dough will combine, destroying any chance of lamination.

152
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,240
但是皇家咖啡酒店的首席面包师罗曼
But Romain, head baker of the Hotel Cafe Royal,

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,560
他有一种交易技巧。
has a trick of the trade up his sleeve.

154
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,480
罗曼刚刚把压好的面团放进了冰箱。
So, Romain has just put the laminated dough in the freezer.

155
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,280
我会做15分钟。
I would do 15 minutes.

156
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,800
对于他们创造的维也纳噪音，
For their Viennoiserie creation,

157
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,640
希尔顿公园巷五星级酒店的伊曼纽尔和山姆
Emmanuel and Sam of the five-star Hilton Park Lane

158
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,640
他们有自己的技巧。
have a trick of their own.

159
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,880
好吧，你在做什么，萨姆?
OK, so what are you doing, Sam?

160
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,000
crioche。crioche。
A crioche. A crioche.

161
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,360
是饼干，奶油蛋卷，捣碎在一起。噢!
Yeah - it's a cookie, brioche, smashed together. Ooh!

162
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,880
山姆会把香草奶油蛋糕和山核桃曲奇混合在一起
Sam will combine vanilla brioche with pecan cookie dough

163
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,400
把他的发明装满焦糖苹果
and fill his invention with caramelised apple

164
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,440
和一份卡尔瓦多斯奶油冻。
and a Calvados mousseline.

165
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:15,360
奶油冻，焦糖苹果，
So, Calvados mousseline, caramelised apple,

166
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,760
饼干……还有奶油蛋糕。和核桃吗?
cookie... And the brioche. And pecan?

167
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,200
和蛋糕。毫米。
And brioche. Mm.

168
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,440
他吹口哨
HE WHISTLES

169
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,040
发生了很多事，伙计们?
A lot going on, guys, huh?

170
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
你说疯了。疯狂，我想。
You said crazy. Crazy, I want.

171
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,480
伯明翰名胜世界的达里尔和巴雷特
Darryl and Barrett of Birmingham's Resorts World

172
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
我对颜色很着迷。
have gone crazy with colour.

173
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,880
我在做粉色的丹麦饼，
I'm making a pink Danish,

174
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,640
试着联系一下
trying to go a bit in touch

175
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,480
用我女性化的一面。
with my feminine side.

176
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,920
他的粉色丹麦糕点盒会被装满的
His pink Danish pastry cases will be filled

177
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,120
搭配白巧克力
with white chocolate

178
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,120
法式奶油，覆盆子凝胶，
creme patissiere, raspberry gel,

179
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,640
还有一份开心果泥。
and a pistachio nut puree.

180
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,040
这些就像volo - auvents。
These are like vol-au-vents.

181
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,200
这是正确的。那是我出生之前的事了。
That's right. Those are before my time.

182
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,720
我想它们在80年代的时候是很火的。
I suppose they were, like, really hot in, like, the '80s.

183
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:50,720
是的，我们要救活他们。
Yeah - we're gonna revive them.

184
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,840
我们只能拭目以待了。
We'll have to wait and see.

185
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,320
你知道评委是什么样的。他们可能会把它放在石板上。
You know what the judges are like. They'll probably slate it.

186
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
但是，你知道。
But, you know.

187
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,000
说到给评委留下好印象，
When it comes to impressing the judges,

188
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
一个队将有优势。
one team will have an advantage.

189
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,720
罗曼，我没猜错吧，你是烘焙部的主管?
Now, Romain, am I right in thinking, you are head of baking?

190
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,840
贝克。头贝克!
Head baker. Head baker!

191
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,040
比如谢丽尔·贝克。
Like Cheryl Baker.

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,280
皇家咖啡厅的首席面包师。
Head baker at Hotel Cafe Royal.

193
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,880
你觉得这能让你比别人领先一步吗?
So, does that give you a head start on everybody, do you think?

194
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,040
我比谁都紧张。
I'm more nervous than everyone.

195
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,920
为什么?我的命悬一线!
Why? My head is on the line!

196
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,120
罗曼发明了浪漫的丹麦糕点花
Romain has invented romantic Danish pastry flowers

197
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
螺旋状的普通和粉色糕点在哪里
where spirals of plain and pink pastry

198
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,600
填满覆盆子果酱会坐
filled with raspberry jam will sit

199
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,920
在开心果黑貂饼干基底上。
on a pistachio sable biscuit base.

200
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,080
这是我们以前从未见过的吗?
Is that something we've never seen before?

201
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,440
你可能以前见过。
You've probably seen it before.

202
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,880
这个形状，我相信你见过。
This shape, I'm sure you've seen.

203
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,280
他不能发明一个新的形状!
He can't invent a new shape!

204
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,800
只有这么多形状。
There's only so many shapes.

205
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,280
丹麦人的身材现在已经很出名了，
The shape of the Danish is always kind of well known now,

206
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,920
但这样做的时候，底部就不会有开心果了。
but then it is not done with a pistachio sable in the bottom.

207
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,760
我们拭目以待。你有足够的创造力吗?
We will see. Have you been creative enough?

208
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,640
这是我的问题，你安全了吗?
That's my question - or have you been safe?

209
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
我们拭目以待。
We will see.

210
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,040
Hideko和Teo的情况很不安全
Things are far from safe with Hideko and Teo

211
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,280
来自独立糕点定制公司Sweet Art Lab
from the independent bespoke pastry business, Sweet Art Lab.

212
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:55,040
虽然是早餐时间，但他们已经开始喝酒了。
It may be breakfast time, but they are already drinking.

213
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,760
你要来杯果汁朗姆酒吗?我喜欢椰子汁朗姆酒。
You like a pina colada? I love pina colada.

214
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,320
他们的朗姆酒糕点
Their pina colada pastries

215
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,120
会看到绿色菠萝形状的奶油蛋卷，
will see green, pineapple-shaped brioche buns,

216
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,040
里面是菠萝果泥
filled with pineapple compote

217
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,760
还有椰子和朗姆酒奶油。
and a coconut and rum cream.

218
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,200
我们要做奶油蛋卷面团。
We are going to make brioche dough.

219
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,360
把它像牛角面包一样叠起来。
Laminate it like a croissant.

220
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,320
然后做出菠萝的效果。
and then making like a pineapple effect.

221
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,160
所以，这是一个椰林酒奶油蛋卷。
So, it's a pina colada brioche.

222
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
那么，我们如何缩短它呢?也许喜欢…皮诺什?
So, how do we shorten that? Maybe to like a...Pinoche?

223
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:19,960
一般Pinoche。
General Pinoche.

224
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,280
这就是你想要的，对吧?
That's what you wanted, right?

225
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,880
美味的皮诺什早餐。
A delicious, breakfast Pinoche.

226
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
我…我喜欢它。
I...I like it.

227
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,160
你确定吗?
You sure?

228
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,480
Pinoche。我也是。
Pinoche. Me too.

229
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,840
现在，我要对面团进行第二次折叠。
Now, I am giving the second fold to my dough.

230
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,280
折叠两下，萨沃伊的牛角面包面团…
Two folds in and the Savoy's croissant dough...

231
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

232
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,040
. .似乎没有好转。
..doesn't seem to be improving.

233
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,440
艾迪想弥补我犯下的错误。
Eddie's trying to recover the mistake that I made.

234
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,920
我对它一点信心都没有。
I'm not confident at all with it.

235
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,520
因为发出哔哔声。哔哔声。
Cos BLEEP. BLEEP.

236
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,440
看在上帝的份上。
For BLEEP sake.

237
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,800
在整个比赛中，
Throughout the competition,

238
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,200
巧克力商斯拉夫和玛丽亚
chocolatiers Slav and Maria

239
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,680
他们的招牌食材——
have impressed with their signature ingredient -

240
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,800
但是，在浪漫周，
but, for romance week,

241
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,160
他们抛弃了他们的初恋。
they have turned their back on their first love.

242
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,800
你打算加入一些巧克力吗
Are you going to incorporate some kind of chocolate

243
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,200
在你的创作中?
into any of your creation?

244
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,440
不是今天。
Not today.

245
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,280
我真不敢相信你!下一个挑战。
I can't believe you! On the next challenge.

246
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,680
你总是做巧克力。
You have always made chocolate.

247
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,200
我们今天不想再吃巧克力了。
We like to have a break from chocolate this day.

248
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,080
他们的无巧克力核桃窝
Their chocolate-free walnut nest

249
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,800
看到奶油蛋卷面团了吗
will see the brioche dough

250
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
围绕
swirled around

251

柠檬核桃蛋白酥。
a lemon and walnut meringue.

252
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:21,280
听起来不错，但这很有创意吗?
Sounds nice - but is that very creative?

253
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,320
柠檬漩涡?
A lemon swirl?

254
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,120
对我来说，是的。
For me, it is.

255
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,520
现在是最后一次揉面了。
So, now it's the last fold I give to my dough.

256
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,920
在那之后，我会让它休息一会儿
After that, I will leave it to rest for a little bit

257
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:32,040
然后塑形。
and roll out in shape.

258
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,400
看起来棒极了。看上去不错。
Looking great. Looking good.

259
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,160
牛角面包，我想我可能修好了，我不知道。
So, the croissant, I think I might have fixed it, I don't know.

260
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,400
祈祷。
Fingers crossed.

261
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,200
我在做维也纳杂音的创作。
I'm making the Viennoiserie creation.

262
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,680
确保它是均匀的。
Make sure it's even.

263
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,160
评委们要求几批维也纳杂音
The judges have demanded batches of Viennoiserie

264
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,800
它们完全相同。
that are absolutely identical.

265
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,800
确保他们排好队，然后卡住。
Make sure they're lined up, and they're stuck.

266
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,240
他们必须被困住。
They have to be stuck.

267
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,400
把泡芙泡在奶油蛋卷中间，
Just piping the choux in the middle of the brioche,

268
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,880
然后我们要在上面放上标枪，
and then we're going put the craquelin on top,

269
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,040
然后我们再证明一次。
and then we're going to prove it again.

270
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,640
现在我在做羊角面包。
So, now I'm shaping the croissant.

271
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,720
在这之后，他们将准备好进入证明器。
After this, they will be ready to go in the prover.

272
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,560
实际上一切都很顺利。
It's actually going pretty well.

273
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,800
我画一个三角形，然后把它卷起来。
I do a triangle, and then just roll it.

274
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,520
就这么简单。
Easy as that.

275
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,320
罗曼的经验……
Romain's experience...

276
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,840
我对今天的成果很满意。
I'm quite happy with what we've got today.

277
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,320
. .看到他的两个维也纳噪音首先进入证明
..sees both of his Viennoiserie first into the prover -

278
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,800
而其他的队伍在挣扎。
while the rest of the teams struggle.

279
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,320
我能切吗，你还行吗?我很好。
Can I cut, or are you OK? I'm OK.

280
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,560
9的一半是4.5，不是吗?
Half of 9's 4.5, isn't it?

281
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,520
一个小小的差别最终会产生巨大的差别。
A small difference now make a massive difference at the end.

282
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,640
它们现在越厚，
The thicker they are now,

283
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,120
他们就会证明得越多
the more they are going to prove

284
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,400
之后就会变得越好。
and the more good they are going to be afterwards.

285
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,200
考虑到我给我们带来的麻烦，他们看起来还不错。
Considering the mess I put us into, they're looking OK.

286
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,000
这需要时间。
This is taking time.

287
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,640
和你在一起我很开心!
I'm so happy I'm with you!

288
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,680
我们看看，它还没有被证明。
Let's see - it's not proved yet.

289
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:01,960
大厨们，维也纳音乐界的挑战已经进行了一半。
Chefs, you are halfway through your Viennoiserie challenge.

290
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,440
我们为什么不直接说早餐点心呢?
Why aren't we just saying breakfast pastries?

291
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,600
你可以。厨师们，你们的早餐点心吃到一半了。
You can. Chefs, you are halfway through your breakfast pastries.

292
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,240
当维也纳杂音乐队的作品准备好烘烤时…
Whilst the Viennoiserie creations are ready for the oven...

293
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,440
. .牛角面包至少要发酵一个小时。
..croissants should be left to prove for at least an hour.

294
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,800
周围有很多人，对吧?
There's loads of, like, hanging around, isn't there?

295
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,600
如果它证明的太多或不够，我的意思是，你真的不能做太多。
If it overproves or underproves, I mean, you can't really do too much.

296
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,200
这是一次机会，只有一次机会。
It's one chance, one chance only.

297
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,160
兄弟，你应该给电影或别的什么画外音。
Bro, you should do some voice-over for films or something.

298
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
你眼中的坚定当你说，
The conviction in your eyes when you say,

299
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,120
“一次机会，只有一次机会。”
"One chance and one chance only."

300
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
是的。
Yeah.

301
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,920
等待。
Waiting.

302
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,640
只是等待。
Just waiting.

303
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,560
在比赛中第一次，
For the first time in the competition,

304
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,840
球队没有什么可做的。
there is nothing for the teams to do.

305
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
是的。
Yeah.

306
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,600
我讨厌这个。
I BLEEP hate this.

307
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,720
大厨们，你们还有半个小时，就半个小时。
Chefs, you have half an hour left - that's half an hour.

308
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,240
现在需要做一个权衡。
Now there is a trade-off to be made.

309
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,720
每一分钟都在证明……
Every minute in the prover...

310
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,400
还需要一点时间来证明。
Still a little bit more time to prove.

311
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,840
. .这意味着更少的时间在烤箱里…
..means less time in the oven...

312
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,040
你需要烤一下。是的。你需要烤一下。
You need to bake it. Yeah. You need to bake it.

313
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,040
是的。让我们的时间。
Yeah. let's time.

314
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,960
. .但他们憋得越久…
..but the longer they hold their nerve...

315
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,440
. .他们就越少冒着吃又重又软的牛角面包的风险。
..the less they risk heavy, doughy croissants.

316
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:29,000
我们给牛角面包五分钟，然后把它们放进去。
We'll give the croissants five minutes and then we'll pop them in.

317
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,160
目标是15到20分钟。
Aiming for 15 to 20 minutes.

318
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,480
冰镇了，准备好了。
They're chilled and ready.

319
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,360
继续。
Go on.

320
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,680
放进去。
Put it in.

321
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
现在几点了?34.
What time is it? 34.

322
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,880
我们现在把它们放进去。
Let's put them in now.

323
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,880
我们对他们无能为力。
There's nothing we can do with them.

324
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,120
就是这样。结果很好，结果很好。
That's it. They come out good, they come good.

325
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,920
结果很糟糕，结果很糟糕。
They come out bad, they come out bad.

326
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,400
他们在吐黄油。
They're spitting butter.

327
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,160
大厨们，你们还有15分钟。
Chefs, you've got 15 minutes left.

328
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,680
还有15分钟。
15 minutes left.

329
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,560
我现在对这些很满意。
These ones I'm quite happy with at the minute.

330
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,040
大胆去做吧。关闭它。
Go for it. Close it.

331
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,680
就像撕和分享奶油蛋卷和饼干一样。
It's going to be like a tear and share brioche and cookie.

332
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,960
这不是我想要的，但情况可能会更糟。
It's not exactly what I want, but it could have been worse.

333
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,120
很好。
It's good.

334
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,120
我们还剩多久?
How long do we have left?

335
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,720
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

336
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,040
我的羊角面包还没做好。
My croissants haven't really gone to plan.

337
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,160
把它们拿出来。
Take them out.

338
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,640
他们准备好了吗?他们看起来怎么样?
Are they ready? How are they looking?

339
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,760
是的，他们准备好了。
Yeah, they're ready.

340
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,480
牛角面包差不多好了。
The croissants are almost ready.

341
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,240
大厨们，你们还有一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left.

342
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,640
来吧。
Come on.

343
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,080
我想说，没关系。
It's all right, I would say.

344
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:36,000
大厨们，你们的时间到了。你的时间到了。
Chefs, your time is up. Your time is up.

345
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,320
它们不好。
They're not good.

346
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,800
我想是回家的时间了。
Home time, I think.

347
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,280
罗曼的是最好的。
Romain's is the best.

348
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,240
你快乐吗?我很高兴。
Are you happy? I'm happy.

349
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:44,600
我很高兴你开心!
I'm happy you're happy!

350
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,280
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

351
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:56,440
是时候评判两队的表现了。
It's judgment time for the teams' viennoiserie.

352
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,040
伊曼纽尔和萨姆，请上前。
Emmanuel and Sam, please come forward.

354
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,960
你可以看到它们实际上是不一致的。
You can see that they are actually quite inconsistent.

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,120
这很令人失望。
This is quite disappointing.

356
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,200
看起来不太好。它没有我们想要的蜂巢。
It doesn't look good. It doesn't have the honeycomb that we were looking for.

357
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,000
这是一项正在进行的工作，我只能说这些，
It's a work in progress, that's all I can say,

358
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,680
但这不是它应该在的地方。那你的维也纳杂音创作呢?
but it's not where it should be. What about your viennoiserie creation?

359
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,840
我喜欢饼干和奶油蛋卷的创意，但是制作方法，
I like the idea of the cookie and the brioche dough, but the execution,

360
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,840
你不能只是把东西放在一起就指望它能起作用。
you can't just throw things together and expect it to work.

361
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,280
我很喜欢这个苹果，还有卡尔瓦多斯和
I quite like the apple with the Calvados and the

362
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,840
然而，糕点奶油，
pastry cream, however,

363
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,800
这就是我能说的所有积极的一面。
that's about all that I can say in the positive side.

364
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,320
这是你最大的挑战之一。
This is one of your worst challenges.

365
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,080
你们可以做得更好。
You guys can do better.

366
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,560
对我来说，这里没有足够的工作。
For me, there is not enough work here.

367
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,320
低语:严厉!
WHISPERS: Harsh!

368
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,080
这是非常困难的。
It's very tough.

369
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,280
商店里到处都是。小的，大的。
It's all over the shop. Little ones, big ones.

370
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:14,880
有些看起来像牛角面包，有些看起来什么都没有。
Some look kind of a croissant and some looks like absolutely nothing.

371
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,640
我觉得有点没煮熟。
I think it's undercooked a little bit.

372
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,080
你觉得有一点没煮熟吗?
You think it's undercooked a LITTLE bit?

373
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,160
我不吃没有烤过的维也纳杂烩。
I am not eating viennoiserie which is not baked.

374
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
这是一个核桃窝。
So this is a walnut nest.

375
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,920
它的设计有点简单，
It's a bit of a simple design,

376
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,000
它们看起来相当密集，如果有一件事你不想要的是
and they look fairly dense and if there is one thing you don't want is

377
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:38,920
吃完早餐后感到沉重。
to feel heavy after you have had your breakfast.

378
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,160
你能提醒我们这里面是什么吗?
Can you remind us what is this inside here?

379
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,360
柠檬核桃蛋白酥。
Meringue with lemon and walnuts.

380
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,560
我们只能说维也纳噪音不是你的菜。
What we can say is that viennoiserie is not your thing.

381
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,040
我能看到一些层压，
There's some lamination that I can see,

382
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,760
但我能看到它很不规则。
but I can see it is very irregular.

383
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,680
它是烤好的，但是……
It is baked, but...

384
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:11,280
太紧。创意，展示方式，红色，
too tight. Creations, presentation-wise, red,

385
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,320
大量的红色。上色，伙计们，要适度。
a lot of red. Colouring, guys, with moderation.

386
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,240
我吃的时候很干。
It's so dry when I eat it.

387
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:21,640
我一点也不喜欢吃糕点。
I don't enjoy eating the pastry at all.

388
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,640
嗯。它很重。
Um. It is so heavy.

389
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,920
我们要的是片状，黄油状，一模一样的。
We asked for flaky, buttery, identical.

390
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,800
我必须在所有的方框里划叉。
I have to cross all the boxes.

391
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,840
也许你的创作更走运。
Maybe you got better luck with your creation.

392
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,720
我喜欢这个主意。我喜欢这种执行方式吗?
I like the idea. Do I like the execution?

393
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,400
不。
No.

394
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,640
菠萝的味道还在。
The flavour of the pineapple is present.

395
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,360
它不像看起来那么难吃。
It doesn't taste as bad as it looks.

396
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,360
这是恭维吗?是的!谢谢你！
Is that a compliment? Yes! Thank you!

397
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,880
我担心他们不会发短信不好吃。不。
I fear that they are not going to text not going to taste great. No.

398
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,440
没有?嗯…
No? Well...

399
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,240
嗯，这是什么……事情就是这样。
Well, it is what... It is what it is.

400
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,160
事情就是这样。它很重。它很紧。
It is what it is. It's very heavy. It's very tight.

401
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,960
绝对没有任何瑕疵。
There's absolutely no flakiness whatsoever.

402
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,200
我不打算尝，因为它是生的。
I'm not going to taste it because it's uncooked.

403
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,440
还有你的披肩。
And your briolles.

404
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,880
你已经接受了应有的挑战。
You've taken the challenge as it should be.

405
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,680
你把两种不同的东西合二为一了。
You have combined two different things to make one.

406
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:34,680
有趣。这就是你想要达到的目标吗?
Interesting. Is that what you were trying to achieve?

407
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,240
是的。好的。
Yes. OK.

408
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,120
这两种味道的结合，真的很不错。
The flavour combination of the two, it's actually pleasant.

409
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,240
我喜欢吃它。
I enjoy eating it.

410
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,840
就味道而言，就你放在上面的坚果而言。
In terms of the flavour, in terms of the nuts that you put on top.

411
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,600
泡芙糕点和奶油蛋卷。噢!有趣。
Choux pastry and the brioche. Ooh! Interesting.

412
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,240
我认为你做得很好。我为你感到骄傲，干得好。
I think you did very well. Very proud of you, well done.

413
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,320
是的，非常感谢。再见。
Yeah, thank you very much. See you later.

414
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,240
毫无疑问，这些是当今最好的牛角面包。
There isn't a shadow of a doubt these are the best croissants today.

415
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,200
它们很脆，烤得很好。
They are flaky, they are baked correctly.

416
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,600
它们看起来膨胀了，所以它们被证明了。
They look like they have expanded, so therefore they were proved.

417
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,080
跟我说话，罗曼。这不是我做过的最好的。
Talk to me, Romain. It's not the best I have done.

418
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,400
它可以更轻，蜂巢的质地需要扩大一点。
It can be lighter and the honeycomb texture needs to expand a bit more.

419
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:34,600
话虽如此，我认为我们已经有了一个伟大的开端。
Having said that, I think we have the beginning of what should be great.

420
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,840
让我来打开它。哦，我的天哪!你能听到吗?
Let me crack it. Oh, my goodness! Can you hear that?

421
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:44,400
他们今天卖的牛角面包是最好的。
They are at the best croissants today.

422
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,040
你的维也纳杂音作品。

423

花的图案，底部有开心果甜面酱。
A flower pattern, which has got a pistachio sweet paste at the bottom.

424
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,920
我们在里面放了覆盆子酱和开心果酱。
We've filled it with a raspberry jam and then also a pistachio paste.

425
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
你让我想起了麦当娜。
You remind me of Madonna.

426
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,680
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

427
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,160
麦当娜和你在一起会很开心的。
Madonna would be so happy with you.

428
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,960
特别为她设计的。
Especially created for her.

429
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,240
我真的很喜欢覆盆子的味道。
I really like the flavour of the raspberry.

430
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:19,280
真的。这样就行了，所以你的名声暂时是安全的。
I really do. That makes it work, so your reputation is safe for now.

431
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,680
好。听你这么说我很高兴。
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

432
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,200
第一次我们成功了，所以，
For once, we nailed the first challenge, so,

433
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,240
是的…我们提供了一些东西，这是主要的。
yeah... We served something, that's the main thing.

434
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,200
我们提供了24个牛角包。
We served 24 croissants.

435
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,320
很糟糕，但我们提供了24份。是的。是的。
There were terrible, but we served 24. Yeah. Yeah.

436
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,280
你能做什么?
What can you do?

437
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,120
有时候生活很艰难，但你必须坚持下去。
Sometimes life is hard, you have to get on with it.

毫无疑问，
There is no shadow of a doubt,

443
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:58,920
皇家酒店咖啡馆提供了一套漂亮的维也纳杂耍。
Hotel Cafe Royale delivered a beautiful set of viennoiserie.

Yeah, he was so focused. I can see the fire is in his eyes.

Hilton Park Lane, they've been really good throughout the heats,

但现在到了最后六名，到目前为止，他们还没有真正交付。
but now it's come to the final six, so far, they haven't really delivered.

447
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,520
这是他们今天打出的最差的比赛之一。
This is one of the worst performances they put on the table today.

448
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,400

明天是糖的工作，他们被称为R巧克力。
Tomorrow is sugar work and they are called R Chocolate.

让我们希望他们已经在糖的工作上工作了，因为这可能是一个杀手
Let's hope they have worked on sugar work because that could be a killer

451

457
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,200
待会儿我会告诉你的，珍爱，
I'll tell you about it after this, Cherish,

458

我觉得我们没时间在蛋糕比赛的时候解释Grindr。

杏仁糖让我们的心砰砰跳。

00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,120
你还有四个小时来完成今天的挑战，现在开始计时。

473
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:48,600
这是该比赛第一次全糖展示挑战。
This is the competition's first-ever all sugar showpiece challenge.

474
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,160
把它调到160。
Just bring it back here to 160.

475
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,560
参赛队伍必须建造一个令人惊叹的中心建筑，至少有70个
And the teams must construct a stunning centrepiece at least 70

476
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,680
厘米高。吃糖会出什么问题?
centimetres tall. What can go wrong with sugar?

477
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,440
首先，很明显，它会断裂。
Well, the first, obvious, it can break.

478
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,920
如果它不站着，它就会坍塌，但当它坍塌时，
If it's not standing up still it will collapse, but when it collapses,

479
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,400
它打破了。
it shatters.

480
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,840
我们期待看到漂亮的拉糖，吹糖，砂糖，
We expect to see beautiful pulled sugar, blown sugar, cast sugar and,

481
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,280
当然，糖果必须精致。
of course, the confectionery has to be exquisite.

482
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,040
我们的要求比以往任何时候都要高。
We are asking more than ever.

483
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,360
一定是爱，爱，爱……＃
# It must be love, love, love... #

484
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,640
太热了。经过昨天令人心碎的挑战，
That is hot. After a heartbreaking challenge yesterday,

485
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,680
伊曼纽尔和山姆现在希望用更多的东西来修复关系
Emmanuel and Sam are now hoping to patch things up with more than just

486
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,520
爱的力量。展品是浪漫的，
the power of love. The showpiece is romantic,

487
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,680
但它更有异国情调。
but it's more with an exotic touch.

488
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,200
这种花是外来的，是一种外来的天堂鸟，但这正是我们需要的，
The flower is exotic, an exotic bird of paradise, but that's what we need,

489
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,160
你知道吗?来点浪漫，来点阳光。
you know? A bit of romance, a bit of sun.

490
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:46,320
在一棵浇糖树下，用糖花和吹的
Beneath a poured sugar tree decorated in pulled sugar flowers and a blown

491
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:50,760
糖鸟，将榛子、果仁、蜜糖和杏子拉下来
sugar bird, will sit hazelnut praline pulled sugar sweets and apricot

492
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,160
调味杏仁糖玫瑰。
flavoured marzipan roses.

493
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,360
一支球队进入四分之一决赛的机会可能得到了急需的提振。
And a team's chances of reaching the quarterfinals may have been given a much-needed boost.

494
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,040
我想展示尽可能多的制糖技巧，
I want to show as many sugar skills as possible,

495
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,360
所以我要用到七八种技巧。
so I must have about seven or eight techniques all going on.

496
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,880
就在十个月前，山姆在英国糖锦标赛中获得第二名。
Just ten months ago, Sam came second in the UK sugar championships.

497
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,120
压力和肾上腺素开始发挥作用，
Pressure and adrenaline has to kick in,

498
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:15,120
尤其是当你站在一块要把你融化成碎片的糖块面前的时候。
especially when you're standing in front of a sugar lump that's melting you to pieces.

499
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,920
但山姆并不是房间里唯一的糖专家。
But Sam isn't the only sugar expert in the room.

500
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,880
来自萨沃伊的埃迪是同一比赛的少年组决赛选手。
Eddie from the Savoy was a finalist in the junior category of the same competition.

501
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,760
所以，我们已经有了一个漂亮的波浪形状，吹心就要来了
So, we've got a nice way wavy shape and are blown heart is going to come

502
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,720
从后面绕到前面然后爱无处不在。
from the back around to the front and then love is everywhere.

503
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:32,480
《爱无处不在》，这是中心作品的名字吗?
Love Is Everywhere, is that the name of the centrepiece?

504
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,520
就是现在!埃迪的糖茎模可以支撑一个巨大的吹糖
It is now! Eddie's moulded sugar stem will support a giant blown sugar

505
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,640
心脏将为咸花生果仁糖和
heart that will provide the backdrop for salted peanut praline sweets and

506
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,000
樱桃形状的杏仁糖配开心果核。
cherry-shaped marzipans with pistachio stones.

507
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:47,640
那颗樱桃，它和那件展品有什么联系吗，因为它很浪漫?
That cherry, does it have anything to link with the showpiece, because it's romance?

508
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,640
你们去浪漫野餐的时候，会互相喂樱桃吗?
You know, when you go for a romantic picnic, you feed each other cherries?

509
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,480
我们认为草莓太常见了。我们想做一些不同的事情。
We thought, you know, strawberries are too common. We wanted to do something different.

510
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:55,960
所以你有备用的，对吧?
So you have spares, right?

511
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,440
是的。我可以吗?不。
We do, yes. Can I? No.

512
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,760
当艾迪和山姆在冠军级别的时候…
While Eddie and Sam are at championship level...

513
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:08,680
这就像是一颗美丽的心，或者…
This is like some sort of beautiful heart or maybe a...

514
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,680
这不是一颗心。我只是在工作……也许是肝脏?可能是肝脏?
It's not a heart. I'm just working... Maybe a liver? It could be a liver?

515
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,600
. .这是Maria和Slav第一次只使用糖。
..this is the first time Maria and Slav have worked solely with sugar.

516
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,680
我们要在巴黎搞浪漫。我们做过红心。
We are doing romance in Paris. We've done hearts.

517
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,120
你可以在这里看到。哦!哦!
You can see it here. Oh! Oh!

518
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,240
斯拉夫人的心脏将被三色糖带包裹，而他的
Slav's hearts will be wrapped in tricolour sugar ribbons and his

519
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:29,720
向巴黎的浪漫致敬，将看到两只吹糖情侣拥抱在一起
homage to the romance of Paris will see two blown sugar lovebirds embrace

520
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,000
上面是橘子和开心果杏仁糖花
over orange and pistachio marzipan flowers

521
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,960
还有榛子果仁填充的糖果。
and sweets filled with hazelnut praline.

522
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,080
我可以问一下，你现在是单身吗?
May I ask, are you single at the moment?

523
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,640
我现在是单身。目前为止。
I am single at the moment. At the moment.

524
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,000
我可以问一下，玛丽亚，你现在是单身还是…?
May I ask, Maria, are you single at the moment or are you..?

525
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,880
我现在也是单身。哦!你觉得你们俩能聚一聚吗?
I am single at the moment, as well. Oh! Do you think you guys could get together maybe?

526
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:49,000
我们现在根本没有时间。
We don't have time at the moment at all.

527
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,840
“我爱你”用匈牙利语怎么说?
What is, "I love you," in Hungarian?

528
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:53,280
Szeretlek。Szeretlek。用马其顿语怎么说?
Szeretlek. Szeretlek. And what is it in Macedonian?

529
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,800
Te sakam。Te sakam。
Te sakam. Te sakam.

530
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,400
好吧，我以前还没听说过!
OK, I haven't heard that yet before!

531
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,520
也许有一天你还会听到。不管怎样，我不打扰你了。
Well, maybe you'll hear it again one day. Anyway, I'll leave you to it.

532
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,240
再见!再见!再见!
Bye! Bye! Bye!

533
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:06,920
画外音:斯拉芙和玛丽亚并不是唯一前往情人之城的人。
VOICEOVER: Slav and Maria aren't the only ones headed to the city of lovers.

534
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,480
所以，这是一部法式罗曼史。是的，这是一部法式罗曼史。
So, it's a French romance. Yes, it's a French romance.

535
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,240
巴黎。巴黎。
Parisian. Parisian.

536
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,920
主要部分是一颗心和一些丝带，
The main part is a heart and some ribbons,

537
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,240
红色，蓝色和白色。
the red and the blue and the white colour.

538
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:19,920
法国国旗。我明白你的意思了，西奥，
The French flag. Oh, I see what you're doing there, Theo,

539
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,480
我知道你在干什么。
I see what you're doing.

540
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,480
他们的巴黎之旅将以蓝色和白色的风完成
Their Parisian affair will be completed with blue and white blown

541
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:28,640
甜蜜的情侣，用巧克力和榛子果仁填充的糖果
sugar lovebirds, sweets filled with a chocolate and hazelnut praline

542
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,480
第二天早上，罂粟籽，
and, for the morning after, poppy seed,

543
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,240
芒果和百香果杏仁软糖，不那么浪漫
mango and passion fruit marzipans in the slightly less romantic form

544
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,200
烤面包上放鸡蛋。你知道，在度过一个美好的夜晚之后…
of egg on toast. You know, after a nice night...

545
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,480
哦，啦，啦，啦，啦!你想在床上吃早餐，是吗?
Ooh, la, la, la, la! You want breakfast in the bed, yeah?

546
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,040
你是说就我们俩吗?
You mean just the two of us?

547
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,920
早餐浪漫。你的选择是什么?啊，我们都是。
Breakfast romance. What's your choice? Ah, so all of us.

548
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,800
在皇家咖啡厅的浪漫举动似乎更精致一些。
Romantic gestures at the Hotel Cafe Royal seem to be a little more refined.

549
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,760
我们的展示品会有鲜花，爱心，香槟酒杯，
Our showpiece is going to have flowers, hearts, champagne glasses,

550
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:56,680
草莓。你知道的，和往常一样。

551
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,840
他们是唯一一支尝试两层展示的队伍
They are the only team attempting a two-tiered showpiece where an ornate

553
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,960
还有心形主题的糖雕。

554
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,360
里面会塞满榛子果仁糖和杏仁糖
It will be filled with hazelnut praline sweets and marzipan

555
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,080
用开心果和玫瑰调味的草莓。

556
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,200
我必须试着理解你为什么选择玫瑰来调味
I'm must try to understand why you have chosen rose to flavour a

557
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,880
草莓。因为我们的展品上有玫瑰。

558
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,320
他今天会给你答案!
The man has answers for you today!

559
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,120
我什么都想。
I think about everything.

560
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,840
罗曼，交给你了。
Romain, you are on it.

561
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,520
爱是你的事。
Love is your thing.

562
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,680
它是。罗曼会有浪漫吗?
It is. Could there be romance for Romain?

563
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,640
罗曼浪漫。
Romain romance.

564
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,600
歌词。哦,是的。
Lyrics. Oh, yes.

565
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,680
哦,是的。虽然罗曼已经考虑到了一切…
Oh, yes. Whilst Romain has thought of everything...

566
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,280
我们来画天鹅……
We'll do swans...

567
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,160
嗯，它们可能是鸭子。
Well, they might be ducks.

568
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:47,640
看看结果如何。
See how they turn out.

569
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:50,840
. .Darryl和Bharat的浪漫计划还没有开始
..Darryl and Bharat's romantic plans have yet to be

570
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,280
完全坚定。
fully firmed up.

571
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,680
他们会坐在爱心上面。
They're going to sit on top of the love heart.

572
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,680
就像我和我妻子一样。
Like me and my wife, actually.

573
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,360
嗯…我会为此得到加分的。
Um... I'll get Brownie points for that.

574
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:03,760
在一颗巨大的糖心和两只尚未命名的鸟的下面，
Below a giant moulded sugar heart and two as yet unnamed birds,

575
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,640
要榛子果仁糖、糖果和心形草莓糖吗
will sit hazelnut pralines sweets and heart-shaped strawberry and

576
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:12,880
橙色的杏仁蛋白软糖。我相信会有两只天鹅，也许吧。
orange marzipans. I'm confident there's going to be two swans, maybe.

577
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,560
大厨们，你们的浪漫挑战已经进行了一半。
Chefs, you are halfway through your romantic challenge.

578
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,080
我在吹糖心。
I'm blowing a sugar heart.

579
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,440
温度决定一切。为了成功地吹出并塑造融化的糖，
Temperature is everything. To successfully blow and shape molten sugar,

580
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:26,600
厨师们必须在温度上走钢丝。
the chefs must walk a temperature tightrope.

581
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,400
使用热灯，
Using heat lamps,

582
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,160
他们需要不断确保糖的温度足以操作。
they need to constantly ensure the sugar is hot enough to manipulate.

583
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,760
哎呀!它走了这么远。
Whoops! It went so far.

584
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,960
一旦他们有了满意的形状……
And the moment they have a shape they're happy with...

585
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,360
这很好。
That's good.

586
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,800
. .他们需要用风扇轻轻地冷却糖，直到它凝固。
..using a fan, they need to gently cool the sugar until it sets.

587
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,080
我已经吹好了天鹅，我想让它的脖子开始下垂，
So I have blown the swan, as I want the neck to start to set,

588
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,320
我一直在吹尸体。
I keep blowing the body.

589
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,880
加热或冷却过度，甚至稍微太快，
Heat or cool too much, or even slightly too quickly,

590
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,400
他们精心打造的形体将会破碎。
and their carefully crafted forms will shatter.

591
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,280
它可能会存活下来，但我不确定，因为我需要冷静下来。
It might survive, but I'm not sure because I need to cool down.

592
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:01,120
但是，虽然大多数团队都在吹较小的装饰物品……
But whilst most teams are blowing smaller decorative items...

593
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,240
少了一个。艾迪的整个展览都是围绕着一个巨人建造的
That's one down. ..Eddie's entire showpiece is built around a giant

594
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:08,160
心是由两个巨大的吹成的。
heart made with two huge blown halves.

595
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,280
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

596
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,240
有点冷。可能会更热。
It's a bit cold. It could be hotter.

597
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:17,080
再过10度就没事了。
Another 10 degrees and we'll be fine.

598
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:22,440
它看起来像一只鸟吗?现在我把它哔哔了一下。
Does it look like a bird? Now I've BLEEP this up.

599
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,520
我要重新开始。
I'm going to start this again.

600
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,280
只是温度太低了。这里的情况并不一致。
It's just the temperatures were off. It's not consistent in here.

601
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,000
是的，我想这样就行了。
Yeah, I think that'll do.

602
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,560
按你想要的方式完成工作总是好的。
It's always nice to finish a job the way you wanted to.

603
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,280
埃迪现在有完成不了的危险。
Eddie is now in danger of not finishing at all...

604
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:40,240
哔哔声!哔哔声!
BLEEP! BLEEP!

605
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,000
我再来一次。
I'll start again.

606
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,800
. .离开他的浪漫秀…
..leaving his romantic showpiece...

607
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,480
哔哔声!报纸着火了……没有一颗心。
BLEEP! The paper's on fire. ..without a heart.

608
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,960
还有90分钟我们就能确保进入四分之一决赛。
90 minutes left to secure a place in the quarterfinals.

609
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,600
纸被喷灯夹住了。
The paper caught on the blowtorch.

610
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,440
还有其他的展示元素有待构建……
And with other showpiece elements still to construct...

611
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,080
我相当高兴……艾迪的心脏让他慢下来了。
I'm reasonably happy. ..Eddie's heart is slowing him down.

612
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,040
它是半个心形的。
It's half a heart shape.

613
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,240
除了令人惊叹的糖展示，
As well as a stunning sugar showpiece,

614
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,920
法官要求30…
the judges have demanded 30...

615
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,880
三、四、五、六、七、八、九、十……
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten...

616
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:25,480
. .精致的杏仁糖，看起来和味道一样好。
..exquisite marzipans that look as good as they taste.

617
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:29,760
我在做西装的蝴蝶结。
I'm making the bow for the suit.

618
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,680
用喷灯，它们看起来真的像一片面包。
With the blowtorch, they really look like a slice of bread.

619
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,800
吐司鸡蛋对你来说是一顿非常浪漫的晚餐吗?
Is egg on toast a very romantic meal for you?

620
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,040
这是狂欢之夜之后，这是美味的早餐。
This is after the wild night, it's the lovely breakfast.

621
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,080
一夜狂欢之后，你居然喜欢给人做鸡蛋吐司?
Wow, after a wild night you like to make someone egg on toast?!

622
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,760
就是这样!到床上去!
That's it! And get into the bed!

623
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,560
他们的30个浪漫杏仁糖必须再加上30个拉出来的果仁糖
Their 30 romantic marzipans must be escorted by 30 more pulled praline

624
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:54,040
糖果。我们有两个糖，一个银的，一个金的。
sweets. So we've got two sugar, one silver, one gold.

625
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,040
吃点果仁糖。
Pipe some praline.

626
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,080
我们选了咸花生味的。人人都爱吃花生。
We've gone for a salted peanut flavour. Everybody loves a peanut.

627
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,040
会出什么问题呢?有时当你折叠它时，
What could go wrong? Sometimes when you fold it,

628
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,560
到处都在漏。
it's just leaking everywhere.

629
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,720
棘手的是……
The tricky part...

630
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,720
嗯……。我都不知道会发生什么。
Grr. I don't even know what's coming out.

631
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,880
我们得确保这些都密封得很好，
We've got to make sure these are sealed properly,

632
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,320
当你要滚动的时候，你必须要快。
and then when it comes to rolling, you've got to be fast.

633
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,960
如果糖太凉了……哔哔声。
If the sugar becomes too cool... BLEEP.

634
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,680
. .它太脆了，倒不出来。
..it will be too brittle to pour.

635
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,480
冷却得太快了。
That's cooled down too fast.

636
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,680
毁掉了送出薄弱点的机会，
Ruining any chance of delivering the thin,

637
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,600
评委们想要的脆壳。
crisp shell the judges will be looking for.

638
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,760
温度下降了。我们要重新开始。
The temperature's off. We're going to start again.

639
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,560
你想要那种嘎吱嘎吱的感觉。我不想要什么东西
You want that crunch and snap, though. Don't want something where

640
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,640
你吃的时候会咬断牙齿的。
you're going to break your teeth when you eat it.

641
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,920
但扯得太细了，
But pulled too thin,

642
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:35,200
果仁馅料可能不会停留在糖果的中心。
and the praline filling may not stay in the centre of the sweet.

643
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:37,560
这个问题非常非常难。
This one is very, very difficult.

644
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,920
我对此非常满意。我是说，这是我工作中最难的部分。
I'm super happy with this. I mean, there was the harder part of my job.

645
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,280
是的，我能看到一些。
Yeah, I can see some here.

646
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,760
大厨们，爱还会在空气中停留一小时。
Chefs, love is in the air for one more hour.

647
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,080
如果我们不动的话，我们就会有点哔哔声了。
We're going to be a little bit in the BLEEP if we don't move.

648
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,000
我们需要继续努力，全力以赴。
We need to crack on, big-time.

649
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:58,080
我们必须集合，所以时间肯定很紧。
We have to assemble, so definitely going to be tight on time.

650
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,480
为了建造他们的样板，
In order to build their showpiece,

651
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,040
摄制组现在必须重新引入可能致命的高温
the teams will now have to reintroduce potentially lethal heat...

652
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,120
我们完蛋了……快速冷却…
We're doomed. ..and rapid cooling...

653
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,520
. .他们精心构造的糖元素。
..to their delicately constructed sugar elements.

654
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:13,320
对，很好，很直。等等，不，不，不。哔哔声。
Yeah, that's nice and straight. Wait, no, no, no. BLEEP.

655
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,680
我们还有时间。把它粘上!
We've got time. Stick it on!

656
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,880
它很好。
It's fine.

657
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,880
漂亮的一个。
Nice one.

658
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,640
你说它是直的。
You said it was straight.

659
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,600
看起来……如果你从这里看。
It looks... If you look at it from here.

660
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,960
也许是这里的花，上面的鸟。
Maybe the flower here, the bird on the top.

661
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,080
哔哔声。也许更多一点。是的。
BLEEP. Maybe a bit more. Yeah.

662
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,320
哦，别碰，如果它裂开了…
Oh, don't touch, if it splits...

663
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,160
有点易碎，不是吗?是的，它很脆弱。
It's a bit fragile, no? Yeah, it's very fragile.

664
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,640
我把它放进微波炉。不可能。我来做。
I put it in the microwave. No way. I'll do it.

665
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,760
它一点也不直。
It's not straight at all.

666
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,360
是的，因为它现在在转弯。
Yeah, because it's now turning.

667
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,360
稍等一下。
Just hold on a minute.

668
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,760
因为我举起了它。
Cos I was lifting that.

669
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,280
挑战。这是我今天做的第四次了。
Challenge. The fourth one I've done today.

670
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,120
大厨们，你们还有十分钟。
Chefs, you've got ten minutes left now.

671
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:19,400
十分钟。小心我的头发。
Ten minutes. Watch out for my hair.

672
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,720
是的。我想把这个摆到桌子上。
Yeah. I want to get this on the table.

673
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:31,440
哦,上帝。
Oh, God.

674
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,600
把聚苯乙烯靠近点。
Bring the polystyrene closer.

675
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,200
我一点也不喜欢这个。
Don't like this at all.

676
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,080
它在倾斜，不是吗?
It is leaning, isn't it?

677
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,440
比萨斜塔是倾斜的。
Well, the Tower of Pisa leaned.

678
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,160
它还在上面。把它放在上面。
It's still up. Put it on the top.

679
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,840
它会断裂的。是的。
It's going to break. Yeah.

680
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:04,000
上面放不下。把它放在那里。
Can't fit on top. Put it there.

681
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,080
忘了中间那颗心吧。
You know, forget about the heart in the middle.

682
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,120
忘了那个吧。
Forget about that.

683
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,280
给我大量的胶水。
Just give me loads of glue.

684
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,960
不，它撑不住的。
No, it's not going to hold on.

685
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,480
把胶水给我。把它贴在上面，没事的。
Just give me the glue. Just stick it on that, it's fine.

686
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:18,880
要么做，要么什么都不做。
It's either this or nothing.

687
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
这个怎么样?
What about this one?

688
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,160
别操之过急啊。
Don't bloody rush it for the sake of it.

689
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,440
我们需要一些东西来支撑它。
We need something to lean it on.

690
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,480
你知道吗?一个罐子里。
Do you know what? A jar.

691
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,840
大厨们，你们还有一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left.

692
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,440
这是一分钟。
That's one minute.

693
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,480
我觉得看起来不错。是的，很好。
I think that looks good. Yeah, it's good.

694
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,360
这太热了。它把茎融化了。
This is too hot. It's melting the stems.

695
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,640
你把所有的糖果都带上了吗?
Have you got all the sweets on?

696
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,080
好的，让我们移动，把剩下的放在底部。
Right, let's move - hold the rest of it at the bottom of that.

697
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,560
每次我看到它，都会吓到我。
This freaks me out, every time I look at it.

698
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,920
但它没动，对吧?
It's not moving, though, is it?

699
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,080
否则它现在已经倒下了。
Otherwise it would have fallen by now.

700
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,960
哦,不!
Oh, no!

701
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,080
我的天。
My days.

702
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,680
为什么会发生在他们身上?
Why did that happen to them?

703
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,000
哦,不。
Oh no.

704
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,560
时间到了。
Time is up.

705
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,880
该坐下了。
Time for a sit.

706
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,240
五个令人惊叹的浪漫秀
Five stunning romantic showpieces

707
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,000
还有一次毁灭性的分手
and one devastating break-up

708
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,960
现在由珍爱和伯努瓦来评判。
will now be judged by Cherish and Benoit.

709
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,960
你在一个糖的展示中加入了很多技术，这真的是
You put a lot of technique into one sugar showpiece which is really

710
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,880
做得很好。这花真漂亮。
well done. The flower is really attractive.

711
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,760
它是人们关注的中心。
It is the centre of attention.

712
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,240
这条缎带很漂亮。
This ribbon is beautiful.

713
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,640
可爱的曲线。
Lovely curves.

714
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,960
干得好。你的黄玫瑰，告诉我们里面有什么?
So well done. Your yellow roses, tell us what's in it?

715
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,200
杏仁杏仁蛋白软糖。
Almond marzipan with apricot.

716
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,880
我不得不说，它们看起来很漂亮。
I have to say, they look pretty.

717
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,240
杏仁蛋白软糖非常湿润，非常好吃。
Marzipan is really moist and it's really nice.

718
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,080
如果你能在里面多放一点杏，我会更喜欢它。
If you could have put a little bit more apricot in it I would have enjoyed it more.

719
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,800
是的。拉出来的糖甜甜的，有一种美好的优雅。
Yeah. Pulled sugar sweet, there is a good elegance to it.

720
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,640
就味道而言，花粉是可爱的。
Flavour-wise, the pollen is lovely.

721
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,000
伯努瓦说明了一切。我觉得糖有点厚，
Benoit says it all. I think the sugar is a little bit thicker,

722
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,000
然而，我喜欢中间的金色。
however, I like the gold in between.

723
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
谢谢你！谢谢,厨师。
Thank you. Thanks, chefs.

724
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
没关系。
That was all right.

725
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,880
这件作品向后倾斜，但我认为它很优雅。
The piece is tilting towards the back but I think it's elegant.

726
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,040
不过你做得很好
You did very well, however,

727
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,520
现在它只是堆积起来，我看不到美丽的
at the moment it's just piling up and I cannot see the beauty of the

728
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,760
你送给我们的糖果。
confectionery that you present us.

729
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,000
这是草莓橙杏仁蛋白软糖，配上橘子酱
So this the strawberry and orange marzipan with an orange confit

730
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,040
在中间。
in the centre.

731
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:32,720
杏仁软糖不太油腻，而且我有你喜欢的橘子味。
The marzipan is not too greasy and I've got your orange flavour.

732
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:36,400
我根本尝不出草莓的味道，但我不喜欢这种果酱。
I could not taste strawberry at all, but I don't like the confit.

733
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,960
你的拉糖很甜。
Your pulled sugar sweet.

734
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,320
我确实尝出了你放在中间的果仁糖的味道。
I do taste the praline that you put in the centre.

735
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:47,640
中间有脆脆的口感。
I've got the crunchiness in the middle.

736
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,520
你走的方向是对的。
You are going in the right direction.

737
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,920
把罐子移到一边看看。
Slide the jar to the side and see.

738
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,760
他迅速地呼了一口气
HE EXHALES RAPIDLY

739
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,360
你看起来开心多了。我是。
You look already happier. I am.

740
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,960
每次我看到你的作品都有故事。我知道
There's always a story when I look at your showpiece. I know it's

741
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,840
浪漫，我知道那是情人节，我知道那是爱情。
romance, I know that it is Valentine, I know that it's love.

742
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,640
那辆双门轿车真漂亮。
That coupe is beautiful.

743
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:21,080
把它放在那上面会是一流的。
This sitting on that would have been top notch.

744
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,200
玫瑰，草莓，开心果。
It's a rose, strawberry with a pistachio top.

745
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,160
配上那些小燕尾服外套看起来很漂亮。
It looks quite nice with those little tuxedo jackets.

746
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,320
玫瑰慢慢绽放，
The rose kicks in slowly,

747
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:39,640
所以它不会像你吃一块肥皂那样强烈。
so it's not overpowering like you're eating a bar of soap.

748
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
糖甜。
Sugar sweet.

749
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,960
对我来说，果仁糖绝对是美味的。
So for me the praline is absolutely lovely.

750
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,480
烤得恰到好处，榛子香味扑鼻。
Perfectly roasted, I got the hazelnut, it's full of fragrance.

751
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,680
非常感谢。两人:谢谢。
Thank you very much. BOTH: Thank you.

752
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,320
你满意吗?是的。
Are you happy with that? Yeah.

753
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,080
你的心脏的形状，嗯，这是一个基本形状，
Your heart shape, well, it's a basic shape,

754
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,120
那么，我们是如何做到不把它弄得很整洁的呢?
so how do we manage to not get it very neat and tidy?

755
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,280
我不知道，至于吹糖，形状完全不对。
That I don't know, and as far as the blown sugar, the shape is all wrong.

756
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:20,320
对我来说，是鸟嘴。你用手指夹住鸟嘴。
For me, it's the beak. You pinch the beak between your finger flat.

757
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:25,360
这不是一只天鹅。是的，这更像是达菲鸭的嘴。
This is not a swan. This is more of a Daffy Duck kind of beak, yes.

758
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,720
底部是橙色杏仁软糖。
Orange marzipan on the bottom.

759
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,280
上面是开心果。
On the top, pistachio.

760
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,240
当我看着它的时候，我觉得它没有投入太多的工作。
When I look at it I think there's not much work put into it.

761
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,720
桔子的味道很好。
The taste of orange is quite pleasant.

762
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,200
话虽如此，它还是压倒了其他一切。
Having said that, it takes over everything else.

763
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,960
我已经有了足够的味道，我知道这是果仁糖，但我觉得还不够。
I've got enough flavour, I know it's a praline but I think not enough.

764
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:51,400
我想我是那个倒霉的人，我没有看到任何填充物。
I guess I'm the unlucky one, I don't see any sort of filling.

765
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,320
哦。我想这是我的错。
Oh. I think it's my fault.

766
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:13,680
不，别这样。把它加热得太热了，还不够冷。
No, come on. Warm it up too much, and didn't cool enough.

767
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:17,440
我很喜欢它。你骄傲地站起来说"这就是我，
I quite like it. You stand up very proudly and you say "This is me,

768
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,920
"是我干的"没多少人会这么做。
"I did it," and not many people would do that.

769
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,440
挑战的最后20分钟你一直在加所以基础在哪里
The last 20 minutes of the challenge you keep on adding so the base where

770
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,560
你的心脏还没有完全冷却，
your heart was actually standing wasn't completely cooled,

771
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,160
所以继续前进，继续前进，最终——轰。
so keep on moving, keep on moving and eventually - boom.

772
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,160
你能带我们去拿你的杏仁糖吗?
Could you please take us to your marzipan.

773
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,680
这是一种百香果。
It's a passion fruit.

774
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,120
吐司是用什么做的?
What is the toast made from?

775
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,920
杏仁加罂粟籽。
Almond with poppy seed.

776
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:41,760
你们这些家伙总是想出一些时髦的设计，这是一个饼干。
You guys always come up with funky design and this is a cracker.

777
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,160
我喜欢这个。
I love this.

778
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,320
百香果和里面的油酥饼
The passion fruit with that little confit you have got inside

779
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,880
简直令人惊叹。做得很好。
is just stunning. Well done.

780
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,520
糖甜。
Sugar sweet.

781
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,240
我很喜欢你揉糖的样子。
Really like the way you twist your pulled sugar.

782
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,560
你能找到果仁糖吗?
Can you find any praline in there?

783
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:09,440
有一种果仁糖的味道，实际上很不错。
There is a taste of the praline and it is actually quite nice.

784
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:13,000
我想我是那个倒霉的人，我在里面找不到果仁糖。
I think I've been the unlucky one, I could not find any praline in it.

785
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:16,160
我很期待吃这些，因为它们看起来很漂亮。
I was so looking forward to eating these because they look so pretty.

786
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,920
谢谢厨师们。谢谢你！
Thank you, chefs. Thank you.

787
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,240
小声说:做个三明治。做一个三明治。
WHISPERED: Make a sandwich. Make a sandwich.

788
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,080
噢，蛋黄掉进我的衬衫里了!
Oh, the yolk's gone down my shirt!

789
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,200
做得很好。做得很好。
Well done. Well done.

790
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
你做了一些技巧，
You did a couple of techniques,

791
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,000
然而，我认为它执行得很糟糕。
however, I think it's really poorly executed.

792
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:49,200
你想做的太多了。你的思维过程是，
You're trying to do too much. Your thought process is,

793
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,000
"我要做一件极其复杂的事"
"I'm going to do something extremely complicated",

794
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,360
但在这种情况下，你无法做到。
but for that instance you can't pull it off.

795
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:55,560
你的杏仁蛋白软糖。
Your marzipan.

796
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,920
酸樱桃杏仁蛋白软糖。
So, sour cherry marzipan.

797
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,280
里面有一个开心果杏仁糖。
And inside it has a pistachio marzipan.

798
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,800
它还有一个巧克力梗。
It has a little chocolate stem as well.

799
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:05,320
哦,tra-la-la。今天不是在这里炼巧克力的日子。
Oh, tra-la-la. Today was not the day to temper chocolate in here.

800
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,600
每次我们进来，都有借口。
Every time we come in, there is excuses.

801
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,640
让我们品味。
Let's taste.

802
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:17,280
我的大脑让我吃樱桃，
My brain is asking me to eat cherry,

803
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:21,160
但我的味蕾并没有问我里面有樱桃。
but my taste bud is not asking me that there is cherry in there.

804
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,560
好的。
OK.

805
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:26,000
至于果仁糖，你看到了吗?
As for the praline, do you see any?

806
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,360
不。我在挣扎。
No. I'm struggling.

807
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:30,040
我也是。我可以舔一点。
Me too. I can lick a little bit.

808
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:32,040
太遗憾了，这么辛苦
It's a shame, with struggling so much

809
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:33,600
为了找到咸花生布朗尼，
to find a salted peanut brownie,

810
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,040
因为当我拥有它的时候，它终于变得美丽了。
because when I had it, finally it was beautiful.

811
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:38,080
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

812
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,320
我很抱歉。你可以品尝到樱桃的味道。
I'm sorry. You can taste cherry in there.

813
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,280
我不管他们怎么说，你能尝到樱桃的味道。
I don't care what they say, you can taste cherry.

814
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,120
不管怎样，收拾行李，我们要回家了。
Anyway, pack your bags, we're going home.

815
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,440
根据今天的展品和昨天的微缩模型，
Based on today's showpiece, and yesterday's miniatures,

816
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,480
珍惜和伯努瓦现在要给队伍排序，
Cherish and Benoit must now rank the teams,

817
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:01,360
最后一名将被淘汰。
and those in last place will be leaving the competition.

818
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,920
我们想我们已经出局了。
We think we are out from now.

819
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,240
你在最后一刻才把所有东西凑在一起，
You stick everything together at the last minute,

820
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,400
任何事情都没有时间冷静下来。
nothing has time to cool down correctly.

821
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,880
我不期待下一个挑战，我想。
I am not looking forward to go to the next challenge, I think.

822
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,880
也许我们要退出比赛了。
Probably we are going to leave the competition.

823
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,720
我们接受命运，木已成舟，
We'll accept our fate, what's done is done,

824
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,600
但我认为我们今天没有尽力。
but I don't think we did our best today.

825
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,000
我们有更多的东西可以奉献。我知道我们有。
We have a lot more to give. I know we do.

826
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:33,280
第一名的队伍在比赛中彻底失败了
The team in first place absolutely blew the competition

827
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,520
带着他们的维也纳音乐从水里出来
out of the water with their Viennoiserie,

828
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,160
恭喜你们，琳恩和罗曼，
congratulations, Leanne and Romain,

829
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:42,800
来自皇家咖啡厅的选手，你们晋级了四分之一决赛。

来自萨沃伊的艾迪和马希德。
Eddie and Mahshid from the Savoy.

834
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,440
那就只剩下甜蜜艺术实验室的Hideko和Theo，
Which leaves Hideko and Theo from Sweet Art Lab,

835
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,680
还有R巧克力店的斯拉夫和玛丽亚。
and Slav and Maria from R Chocolate.

836
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,320
经过深思熟虑，
After much deliberation,

837
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:15,640
评委们决定今晚离开我们的队伍是…
the judges decided that the team leaving us tonight are...

838
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,800
R巧克力店的斯拉夫和玛丽亚。

839
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,760

Sorry to see you go.

840
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:29,400
祝贺你们其余的人
Congratulations to the rest of you,

841
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,520
我们期待下周与您见面。
and we look forward to seeing you next week.

842
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:37,920
你让我笑了很多。是的。
You've made me smile a lot. Yeah.

843
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,960
我为我们取得的成就感到非常自豪。
I am very proud of what we have achieved.

844
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,320
我们都没想到会走那么远。
We didn't each expect to go that much far.

845
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:47,320
离开很难过，但我觉得这很棒，
It's sad to go, but I think it has been amazing,

846
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:51,640
引用这首歌的歌词:“杀不死你的，会让你更强大。”
and to quote the song, "What doesn't kill you makes you stronger."

847
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,920
所以…当然可以。
So... Of course.

848
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:57,960
HIDEKO:我真不敢相信!
HIDEKO: I can't believe it!

849
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,240
我们又活下来了!
We survived again!

850
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:02,320
非常高兴。做得很好。
Very happy. Well done.

851
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,560
如果我们在四分之一决赛中出局，那就让我们大干一场吧，
If we go out in the quarterfinals let's go out with a bang,

852
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:12,040
不管是展品倒下了，还是我们做出了可怕的东西，
whether it's the showpiece falling down or we make something horrible,

853
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,840
让我们轰轰烈烈地结束吧。
let's just go out with a bang.

854
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:17,040
下次，四分之一决赛。
Next time - the quarterfinals.

855
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,240
就差这么近了。
Getting so close now.

856
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:19,960
层层叠叠的马卡龙蛋糕……
A towering tiered macaron cake...

857
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,560
希望它不会倒塌。
Hope it doesn't collapse.

858
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:24,080
. .和一个梦幻般的童话展示…
..and a fantastical fairy tale showpiece...

859
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,560
你相信有仙女吗，珍爱?
You believe in fairies, Cherish?

860
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,080
是的，我当然相信有仙女。
Yes, of course I believe in fairy.

861
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,000
. .意味着一个团队的梦想……发出哔哔声
..means one team's dream... BLEEP

862
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,880
. .会变成一场噩梦。破解是什么?
..will become a nightmare. What's cracking?

863
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:33,480
哦，拜托，伙计!
Oh come on, man!

在下周的半决赛中。
in next week's semifinal.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,280
不仅如此，本周我们的主题是童年，
And not only that - this week, our theme is childhood,

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,840
所以我们的厨师将带我们回到婴儿时期的简单时光。
so our chefs will be taking us back to the simpler times of our infancy.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:17,280
还记得童年吗，利亚姆?我当然知道。我现在已经是个孩子了，兄弟。
Remember childhood, Liam? Course I do. I'm pretty much a kid now, bro.

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,160
他咯咯地笑着玩捉迷藏。玩国际足联。
HE CHUCKLES Playing Hide and Seek. Playing Fifa.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,960
骑着我的小三轮车。穿着高跟鞋嗖嗖地走来走去。
Riding round on my little tricycle. Whizzing around in heely shoes.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,560
唱一圈一圈的玫瑰。看歌舞青春。
Singing Ring a Ring O' Roses. Watching High School Musical.

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,600
天啊，我太老了，利亚姆!我太老了!
Oh, God, I'm so old, Liam! I'm so old!

10
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:31,240
你看起来有点劳累过度。我不累，利亚姆!
You seem a little bit overtired. I'm not tired, Liam!

00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,880
来吧，我们开始挑战吧，这样你就可以睡个午觉了，好吗?
Come on, let's just start the challenge so you can have a nap, OK?

好的，谢谢，利亚姆。
Yeah, I'd like that, thanks, Liam.

13
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,240
最后一次……
Last time...

14
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,080
哔哔声。. .爱情的光芒在浪漫的糖果展示中暗淡下来。
BLEEP. ..The love light dimmed in a romantic sugarwork showpiece.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,200
因为我是BLEEP。我们提供BLEEP。
Because I was BLEEP. We were serving BLEEP.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,800
绝对的哔哔声。
Absolute BLEEP.

17
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,840
Leanne和Romain的设计和口味…
Leanne and Romain's design and flavours...

18
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,440
它是美丽的。一流的。
It's beautiful. Top-notch.

19
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,480
. .事实证明他们是天作之合。
..Proved to be a match made in heaven.

20
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,520
啊!
Ah!

21
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,480
当灾难袭来时……对不起!
While disaster struck... Sorry!

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:00,240
. .让英子和西奥伤心欲绝。
..Leaving Hideko and Theo broken-hearted.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,920
但是斯拉夫和玛丽亚没有感受到爱……
But it was Slav and Maria who failed to feel the love...

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,320
我不会吃的，因为那样会咬断我的牙齿。
I'm not going to eat it because that would break my teeth.

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,720
很遗憾你要走了。
Sorry to see you go.

26
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:09,480
. .成为最后一支退出比赛的队伍。
..and became the latest team to leave the competition.

27
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,040
你让我笑了很多。
You've made me smile a lot.

28
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,080
我为我们取得的成就感到非常自豪。
I'm very proud of what we have achieved.

29
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,320
这一次……哦，它裂开了。
This time... Oh, it's cracking.

30
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,720
. .四分之一决赛……就差这么近了。
..The quarterfinal... Getting so close now.

31
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,520
. .把球队带回到童年……
..takes the teams back to childhood...

32
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,280
只要它不坍塌就行。
As long as it doesn't collapse.

33
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,520
. .作为一个分层的马卡龙蛋糕，引发了愤怒……
..As a tiered macaron cake that sparks a tantrum...

34
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,080
那你来吧。耶稣基督。哔哔声。
You do it, then. Jesus Christ. BLEEP.

35
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,040
. .还有一个规模迷人的童话展示…
..and a fairy tale showpiece on an enchanting scale...

36
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,600
哔哔声。哔哔声。
BLEEP. BLEEP.

37
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,000
. .让他们去面对自己的命运。
..Leave them to face their fates.

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,400
我喜欢这个。
I love this.

39
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:36,920
哪四支队伍会从此幸福地生活在一起?
Which four teams will live happily ever after?

40
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,560
我一点也不喜欢吃。哔哔声。
I didn't enjoy eating it at all. BLEEP.

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,880
谁的冒险即将结束?
And whose adventure is about to end?

42
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,160
啊!
Argh!

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,560
四分之一决赛周。
Quarterfinal week.

44
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,560
在开始比赛的12支队伍中，只剩下了5支。
Of the 12 teams who started the competition, just five remain.

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,400
欢迎回来，大厨们。
Welcome back, chefs.

46
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,680
进入半决赛的机会已经唾手可得了。
A place in the semifinals really is within your grasp.

47
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,440
就差两个挑战了。
Just two challenges away.

48
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,360
评委们，这是多么可怕的噩梦啊
Judges, what terrifyingly nightmarish task

49
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,040
你今天为我们准备好了吗?
have you set for us today?

50
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,560
我想让你做一个马卡龙蛋糕，至少有两种馅料，
I would like you to make a macaron cake, with at least two fillings,

51
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,920
灵感来自你童年的味道。
inspired by flavours from your childhood.

52
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,200
你必须为至少24人服务，
You must serve a minimum of 24 people,

53
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,200
至少有两层。
and feature at least two tiers.

54
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,440
是啊，还记得你小时候要做双层的吗
Yeah, remember when you were a child and you had to make that two-tier

55
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,120
马卡龙展示蛋糕?我想我们在小熊队就做到了。
macaron display cake? I think we did it in Cubs.

56
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,560
还有，珍爱，你想布置什么任务?
And Cherish, what assignment would you like to set?

57
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:38,480
我想要两种不同的甜品，
I would like to have two different types of sucettes,

58
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,200
都是棒棒糖形状的小四。
all lollipop-shaped petit four.

59
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:44,600
各18个，总共36个。
18 of each, 36 in total.

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,840
厨师们，祝你们好运。你会需要它的。
Good luck, chefs. You are going to need it.

61
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,920
你有3.5小时的时间来完成今天的挑战，
You have 3.5 hours to complete today's challenge,

62
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,520
你的时间从现在开始。
and your time starts now.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,360
现在我们进入了四分之一决赛，显然，压力开始增加。
Now we're in the quarterfinals, obviously, the pressure starts to build.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,560
我和伊曼纽尔都能在压力下茁壮成长，所以我们应该没问题。
Me and Emmanuel both thrive under pressure, so we should be all right.

65
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,000
童年周不会全是娱乐和游戏。
Childhood Week won't be all fun and games.

66
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,640
今天是我们要做的事情最多的一天。
Today's the day when we have the most ever to do.

67
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,000
四分之一决赛选手不仅要合理安排时间，
Not only must the quarterfinalists manage their time properly,

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
重要的是它们能把味道表现出来
it's crucial they deliver on the flavours

69
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,760
还有他们童年的故事。
and stories of their childhood.

70
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:21,880
我们让他们做马卡龙蛋糕因为马卡龙已经
We've asked them to do a macaron cake because a macaron is already

71
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,320
做起来很棘手，但在比赛的这个阶段，
tricky enough to do, but at this stage of the competition,

72
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,240
在四分之一决赛中，我们希望他们做一个更大的版本。
in the quarterfinal, we want them to do a larger version of that.

73
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,120
出错的地方可能是用了错误的方法来制作马卡龙。
What could go wrong is use the wrong technique of piping your macaron.

74
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,960
这个小技巧就是不要用管子把贝壳管起来，
The little trick is not to pipe a shell,

75
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,800
但是要把马卡龙做成螺旋状
but to pipe the macaron in a spiral motion

76
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,240
让它更容易切和烤。
and make it easy to cut and to bake.

77
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,800
如果烤得不对，
If it's not baked correctly,

78
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,000
它会裂开，不好看，也不开胃。
it will crack and it's not going to be very pretty or appetising.

79
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,360
将磨碎的杏仁和糖粉折叠成搅打过的蛋白，
Made by folding ground almonds and icing sugar into whipped egg whites,

80
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,880
自16世纪以来，马卡龙一直是法国糕点的主食。
the macaron has been a staple of French patisserie since the 16th century...

81
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,960
我们经常吃的东西。
Something we are used to eating quite often.

82
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,520
基本上就像牛角面包。
It's like croissant, basically.

83
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,800
. .这给了我们海峡对岸的表亲一点优势。
..giving our cousins from across the Channel a slight advantage.

84
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,960
我们确实做了很多，但都是小号的。
We do make a lot of them, but they tend to be petit four size.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,600
我们很少做大的24件，所以，是的，
We rarely made a large 24 pieces, so, yes,

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,600
这将会有点挑战性。
it's going to be a bit challenging.

87
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
为了纪念伊曼纽尔在法国农村的成长经历，
Paying tribute to Emmanuel's rural French upbringing,

88
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,720
希尔顿公园巷的焦糖香蕉
Hilton Park Lane's caramelised banana

89
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
还有白巧克力甘纳许蛋糕
and white chocolate ganache cake

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,760
回忆起儿时激发他灵感的味道。
recalls flavours that inspired him as a boy.

91
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,120
我有个朋友从一个岛上来。
I had a friend who was coming from an island.

92
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:30,400
他的母亲会用很多异国水果，比如香蕉，
His mother would have used a lot of exotic fruit like banana,

93
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,480
在我老家的村子里，我们是不会用这种东西的
which, from the village where I come from, was not something we would use

94
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,960
当时有很多。
a lot of at the time.

95
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,240
控制它们混合物的稠度是至关重要的。
Managing the consistency of their mixture is crucial.

96
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,040
如果折叠得不够充分，马卡龙就会致密且不均匀。
If it's not folded enough, the macaron will be dense and uneven.

97
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,120
放太多，在烤箱里就会塌。
Too much, and it will collapse in the oven.

98
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,960
它们看起来很简单，但做起来却很困难。
They looks simple, but they are quite a hard thing to make.

99
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,880
我只是尽可能地把它敲出来，这样我就能得到一个光滑的
I'm just banging it out as much as I can so I get a nice smooth

100
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,120
一致性。你会看到它创造了一个漂亮的，
consistency. You'll see it creates that nice, like,

101
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,080
丝带的效果。它们会叠在一起，
ribbon effect. It'll sit on top of each other,

102
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,280
这就是我要找的。
that's what I'm looking for.

103
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,400
我们今天要做的是异域风味的马卡龙。
We're going for quite an exotic macaron flavour today.

104
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
里面会有一种柑橘味的凝乳。
Inside we're going to have a very, like, citrusy curd.

105
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,360
还有萨沃伊凝乳，柚子和血橙果冻
Along with the Savoy's curd, a grapefruit and blood orange jelly

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,640
会坐在一个有灵感的蛋糕里吗
will sit inside a cake that's inspired

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,440
马希德在伊朗的成长经历
by Mahshid's upbringing in Iran.

108
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,320
柑橘，坚果，我们在伊朗吃很多水果。
Citrus, nuts, we eat a lot of fruit in Iran.

109
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,800
这个挑战很棒，所以我可以把所有的东西都结合起来
This challenge is great, so I can incorporate everything

110
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,520
从我的童年到这个挑战。
from my childhood into this challenge.

111
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,120
希望评委们会喜欢。
Hopefully, the judges will like them.

112
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:20,640
虽然每个人都在寻找自己成长时期的灵感，
While everyone is looking to their formative years for inspiration,

113
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,760
“童年周”特别有利于一个团队。
Childhood Week plays into the hands of one team in particular.

114
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:36,120
英子和西奥!你好，你好，你好，你好!你好!
Hideko and Theo! Hello, hello, hello, hello! Hello!

115
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,200
你的主题常常很幼稚。
Your theme is often very childlike.

116
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,160
这周的主题是童年，
Well, this week the theme is actually childhood,

117
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,080
所以你要做些非常成人的事吗，
so are you going to do something very adult,

118
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,000
比如抵押贷款申请之类的?
maybe like a mortgage application or something?

119
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,560
这是你闪耀的机会。
This is your chance to shine.

120
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,840
甜蜜艺术实验室的机会就在蛋糕上了
Sweet Art Lab's chances will rest on a cake

121
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,480
灵感来自西奥在马赛的童年。
inspired by Theo's childhood in Marseille.

122
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,280
覆盆子马卡龙会被层层的荔枝和覆盆子分开
Raspberry macarons will be separated by layers of lychee and raspberry

123
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,680
克雷默和他精致的木槿果冻。
cremeux and his delicate hibiscus jelly.

124
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,240
你小时候吃过荔枝和芙蓉花吗?
As a child, you had lychees and hibiscus flowers?

125
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,680
对我来说，这听起来很复杂。
To me, it sounds very sophisticated.

126
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,800
我是个世故的孩子!
I was a sophisticated kid!

127
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,760
然而，想到琳恩和罗曼的蛋糕，
What springs to mind with Leanne and Romain's cake, however,

128
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,160
不那么复杂，更简单。
is less sophistication and more snackette.

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,040
我们要做我儿时最爱的花生棒。
We're doing my favourite childhood peanut bar.

130
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,440
很有坚果味，
It is very nutty,

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,680
所以如果你喜欢花生，你会喜欢它，如果你不喜欢，
so if you like peanuts you're going to like it and if you don't,

132
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,880
你可能不会。我们对这些味道很满意。
you probably won't. We are happy with the flavours.

133
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,680
如果一切按计划进行，那么是的，希望一切顺利。
If everything goes to plan, then yeah, hopefully, it'll all go well.

134
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
而其他队蛋糕的糖味应该会让评委们感到满意
While the sugar hit of the other teams' cakes should keep the judges

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,200
醒着的时候，名胜世界可以让他们入睡。
awake, Resorts World's could send them to sleep.

136
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,800
我最喜欢的童年记忆之一是麦乳饮料
One of my favourite childhood memories was the malted milk drinks

137
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,480
所以我用的是麦乳精
at bedtime, so I'm using malted milk

138
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,800
还有咸焦糖和一点巧克力。
and salted caramel and a bit of chocolate.

139
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
毫米毫米!我今天会觉得很累。
Mm-mm! I'll be feeling tired today.

140
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:49,200
马卡龙的馅料是杏仁巧克力海绵。
My filling for my macaron, it's an almond and chocolate sponge.

141
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,760
它也会对结构有帮助，所以它不会倒塌在我身上。
It will help with the structure, as well, so it won't collapse on me.

142
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,200
传统上，马卡龙被做成小的管状圆顶，
Traditionally, macarons are cooked as small, piped domes,

143
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,240
但在这么大的规模上，
but on a scale as large as this,

144
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,920
团队必须以不同的方式做事。
the teams must do things differently.

145
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,120
慢慢走，慢慢走。
Go slowly, go slowly.

146
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,880
在薄螺旋盘上加管可以使烤得均匀。
Piping a thin spiral disk allows an even bake.

147
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,520
除此之外的任何东西都可能会留下湿漉漉的底部。
Anything other than this may leave a soggy bottom.

148
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,520
烤好的时候，应该还有螺旋状。
When they're baked, they should still have the spiral.

149
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,320
伯努瓦说得很清楚，这才是他想要的。
Benoit made it clear, actually, that's what he's looking for.

150
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,720
他们想看到螺旋。
They want to see the spiral.

151
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,040
你为什么吹口哨?为了马卡龙蛋糕。
Why are you piping? For the macaron cake.

152
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,960
我知道这不是通常的做法，
I know it's not how it's normally done,

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,360
但这是我习惯的做法。
but this is how I'm used to doing it.

154
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,440
放进去五分钟。
Put it in for five minutes.

155
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,480
马卡龙放入烤箱后，精确的时间是至关重要的。
Once the macarons are in the oven, precision timing is essential.

156
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,040
有了这么精致的混合物，
With such a delicate mixture,

157
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,480
煮熟和未煮熟之间的差别可能是几秒钟。
the difference between over and undercooked can be seconds.

158
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:46,040
他们有十分钟的时间，然后我就去开门。
They're going to have ten minutes, then I'm going to open up the door.

159
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,640
然后我要移动它们，
Then I'm going to move them about,

160
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,960
然后他们还有八到十分钟的时间。
then they're going to have another eight to ten minutes.

161
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,720
把它们取出来太快，它们就会被
Take them out too soon and they'll collapse under the weight of

162
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,600
馅料。放太久会碎的。
the fillings. Leave them too long and they'll shatter.

163
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,320
我花了20分钟，
I've put 20 minutes on it,

164
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,880
很有可能每边都要多花5分钟。
and very likely something like five minutes more for each side.

165
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:05,600
厨师们，你们已经有两个小时了，还剩下一个半小时。
You've had two hours, chefs, and you've got 1.5 hours left.

166
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,800
团队不仅要制作出完美无瑕、优雅分层的马卡龙蛋糕……
Not only must the teams produce a flawless and elegant tiered macaron cake...

167
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,600
. .它必须附有十六块蛋糕。
..It must be accompanied by trente-six sucettes.

168
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,960
对你和我来说是36个棒棒糖。
That's 36 lollipops to you and me.

169
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,200
现在是四分之一决赛了。
It's the quarterfinal now.

170
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,160
我不想看无聊的棒棒糖。
I do not want to see a boring lollipop.

171
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,680
我想看到乐趣，我想看到色彩，
I want to see fun, I want to see colour,

172
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,880
我想看到美妙的味道。
I want to see fantastic flavour.

173
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,960
我想让他们把童年的一切都展现出来。
I want them to bring out whatever they had in their childhood.

174
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,200
这些团队可以自由地使用任何技术来生产他们的成功产品，
The teams are free to use any technique to produce their sucettes,

175
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,920
然而，Benoit和珍惜不仅会评判味道，
however, Benoit and Cherish will not only be judging flavour,

176
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,760
他们也会评估创新和想象力。
they'll be assessing innovation and imagination, too.

177
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,280
我正在把融资费的混合物塞进模具里。
I'm just piping the financier mix into the flexi-moulds.

178
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:47,480
它就像一个小蛋糕，一个小蛋糕放在棍子上。
It's just like a small cake, a small cake on a stick.

179
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,520
就像一个华丽的棒棒糖蛋糕。
It's like a fancy cake pop.

180
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:53,600
除了法式法式蛋糕风格的金融家棒棒糖蛋糕，
Along with their French patisserie-inspired financier cake pops,

181
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,160
艾迪和马希德会献上牛奶巧克力甜糖，里面装满
Eddie and Mahshid will present milk chocolate sucettes filled with

182
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,280
柠檬焦糖咖啡奶油。
a lemon caramel and coffee cremeux.

183
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:02,040
你的两个棒棒糖会很无聊吗?
Are your two lollipops going to be quite dull?

184
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,880
不，味道会说话的。
No, the flavours will speak for themselves.

185
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,680
味道很好。所以你没看到什么吗?
The flavours are great. So it's nothing on the visual with you?

186
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,080
你已经放弃视觉效果了?
You've given up on the visual?

187
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,160
不，看起来会很漂亮，但不会太夸张。
No, it will look nice, but it won't go over the top.

188
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
自信,Mahshid !是的。是啊!
Confident, Mahshid! Yes. Yeah!

189
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,320
艾迪和马希德专注于法国风味，
While Eddie and Mahshid focus on French flavours,

190
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
山姆在重现英国经典。
Sam's recreating a British classic.

191
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,760
这只是一件香草色的貂皮
This is just a vanilla sable

192
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,840
苹果大黄碎棒棒糖的外皮。
for the outside of our apple rhubarb crumble lollies.

193
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,520
作为英国人，大多数英国家庭都会这样做
Being English, most English families would have

194
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,760
在星期天的烧烤晚餐后吃苹果酥。
apple crumble on a Sunday after a roast dinner.

195
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,320
它确实给我带来了很多回忆。
It definitely brings back a lot of memories for me.

196
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:36,520
和Sam一样，Hideko也从家里的舒适中获得灵感。
Like Sam, Hideko's also taking inspiration from the comforts of home.

197
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,720
你小时候吃过胡萝卜蛋糕吗?当然!
You had carrot cake when you were little? Of course!

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,600
在日本吗?
In Japan?

199
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,960
牛轧糖好了。
The nougat's ready.

200
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,080
在巴拉特的糖果店，健康的选择更有限。
In Bharat's sweet shop, the healthy options are a little more limited.

201
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,760
当我还是个孩子的时候，我喜欢牛轧糖。
When I was a kid, I used to love nougat.

202
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,600
总是有一个大包装的粉白色牛轧糖。
There was always a pink and white nougat in a big packet.

203
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,960
哦，我喜欢牛轧糖。你今天要做这个吗?
Oh, I love nougat. So are you making that today?

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,600
是的。哦，哇，我们正在寻找一个款待!
Yeah. Oh, wow, we are looking up for a treat!

205
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
除了爱吃甜食，
As well as a sweet tooth,

206
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,280
巴拉特也迎合了昂贵的口味，
Bharat's also catering for expensive tastes,

207
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,560
配上黑巧克力和橘子软糖
with dark chocolate and mandarin orange gel sucettes

208
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,160
它们被金箔包裹着。
that are encased in gold leaf.

209
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,040
这是最贵的吗?
Is that going to be the most expensive?

210
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,520
可能是吧。
It probably is, yeah.

211
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:22,120
就像23克拉的金箔。噢!哇!听起来富有。
It's like 23-carat gold leaf. Ooh! Wow! Sounds rich.

212
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,080
我的牙齿能钻过去吗?
Will I be able to get my teeth through it?

213
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,440
是的，你可以有一颗金牙。
Yeah, you can have a gold tooth.

214
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,240
你要完成你的品尝…!
You are going to finish your tasting...!

215
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,360
这个挑战有这么多元素，
With so many elements to this challenge,

216
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,120
琳恩和罗曼可能找到了捷径。
Leanne and Romain may have hit upon a short cut.

217
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,400
我在给其中一个棒棒糖做小马卡龙。
I'm just piping the mini macarons for one of the lollipops.

218
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,880
未曾?我听到的是马卡龙吗?
Macaron? Did I hear "macaron"?

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,760
我以为你选的是大马卡龙。
I thought you were picking the big macaron.

220
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,920
我们也在做小的。
We're making small ones, as well.

221
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,240
这算作弊吗?我分两批做。
Is that cheating? I'm making the two separate batches.

222
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,320
琳恩的第二份马卡龙
Leanne's second serving of macarons

223
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,440
会配上几块橙子泡过的“基因之痛”吗
will be accompanied by sucettes of orange-soaked Pain de Genes

224
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,280
还有橘子馅饼，
and mandarin pate de fruit,

225
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,440
最后是黑巧克力橙甘纳许。
finished with a dark chocolate orange ganache.

226
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,400
这是一块海绵，上面有橘子果冻，
So, it's a sponge with basically orange jelly on top,

227
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,000
外层是黑巧克力，对吗，琳恩?
with a dark chocolate covering, is that right, Leanne?

228
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,600
是的。听起来很有创意。
Yeah. That sounds very, um, original.

229
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,000
听起来像雅法蛋糕!嘘!
It sounds like a Jaffa Cake! Shh!

230
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,520
大厨们，你们还有一个小时!
Chefs, you have one hour left!

231
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,760
那是一个小时!目前，一切都很顺利。
That's one hour! For now, it's going all right.

232
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
有很多事要做，所以…还有很多事要做。
A lot to do, you know, so... Still a lot to do.

233
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,560
这是现在的一大推动力。
It's the big push now.

234
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:23,280
这是棒棒糖的小马卡龙。
This is the small macaron for the lollipop.

235
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,400
是的，我对这些很满意。
Yeah, I'm really happy with these.

236
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,960
我只是在填充巧克力壳的底部
I'm just filling the base of our chocolate shells

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,240
加上柠檬焦糖，
with the lemon caramel,

238
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:32,240
最后再淋上咖啡奶油。
and then I'm going to top it off with the coffee cremeux.

239
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,840
只有喜欢咖啡的人才会喜欢这个。
You have to love coffee to love this.

240
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,360
所以它就像24bharat黄金…
So it's like a 24-Bharat gold...

241
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,920
24-Bharat !24-BHARAT黄金!
24-Bharat! 24-BHARAT gold!

242
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,400
当团队构建他们的成功时…
As the teams construct their sucettes...

243
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,440
. .现在是马卡龙的关键时刻。
..It's crunch time for their macarons.

244
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,160
我把这些拿出来。
Let me just take these out.

245
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,680
是的，是的，是的，是的。
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

246
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,080
好吗?看起来不错吧?
Good? They're looking good?

247
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,080
干够了吗?
Dry enough?

248
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,400
哔哔声。伙计，我需要个帮手。
BLEEP. Man, I'm going to need a hand.

249
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,800
拿点调色板。
Just get a little palette.

250
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:04,160
用小调色板把它刮出来。
Get a little palette to scrape this out.

251
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,120
马卡龙有点过了，
The macarons are slightly under,

252
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,440
所以我要多煮一点。
so I'm cooking them a little bit more.

253
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,160
你有时间吗?是的。
Are you good for time? Yeah.

254
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,600
只剩下做马卡龙了，就这样。
It's just the macaron left to build and that's it.

255
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,120
我们要开始组装了吗?
Are we going to start assembling?

256
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:25,320
那些烤了马卡龙的人可以继续组装他们的蛋糕。
Those with macarons baked can push on and assemble their cakes.

257
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:30,720
我只是在粘马卡龙，
I'm just sticking the macarons,

258
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,240
然后把最上面的一块放上去。
and then I'm going to lay the top bit on.

259
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,440
大厨们，你们还有15分钟!
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left!

260
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,960
还剩15分钟!
That's 15 minutes left!

261
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,520
他们需要冰箱。
They need the freezer.

262
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,440
温暖的马卡龙会融化里面的馅料
Warm macarons will melt their fillings

263
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,680
导致他们的蛋糕坍塌。
and cause their cake to collapse.

264
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,680
你能开始吹箫吗?
Can you start piping?

265
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,400
先做这个，这样我就可以用水果装饰了。
Do this one first so I can decorate it with the fruit.

266
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,840
我们现在已经很接近了。
We're getting so close now.

267
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,800
问题只是我们能否及时完成。
It's just whether we can get it done in time.

268
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,200
我希望它不会倒塌。
I hope it doesn't collapse.

269
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,920
不，我是说…漩涡。不要紧。
No, I meant...swirls. Never mind.

270
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:03,120
这对漩涡来说太大了。没关系，没关系。
It's too big for the swirls. Never mind, never mind.

271
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,600
哔哔声。的缘故!得了吧，伙计!
BLEEP. 'Sake! Oh, come on, man!

272
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,000
那你去吧!耶稣基督。
You do it, then! Jesus Christ.

273
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,680
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

274
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,480
现在看起来还不错。
It looks good at the moment.

275
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,920
我们还剩多久?
How long have we got left?

276
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,680
大厨们，你们还有五分钟，五分钟!
Chefs, you've got five minutes left, five minutes!

277
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,320
直接放进冰箱。
Straight into the fridge.

278
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,800
哔哔声。哎呀!。
BLEEP. Crikey.

279
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,480
希望法官也认为他们很完美。
Let's hope the judge thinks they're perfect, as well.

280
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,560
大厨们，你们的时间到了，时间到了!
Chefs, your time is up, your time is up!

281
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:11,120
请把你们的马卡龙放在工作台的末端
Please leave your macarons at the of end your workbenches

282
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,800
离他们远点。
and step away from them.

283
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,640
五层马卡龙蛋糕和180个蛋糕
Five tiered macaron cakes and 180 sucettes

284
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,680
只需要三个半小时。
in just three and a half hours.

285
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,480
现在两队等待伯努瓦和珍爱的评判。
Now the teams await the judgment of Benoit and cherish.

286
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,160
甜蜜艺术实验室的Hideko和Theo可以过来吗?
Can Hideko and Theo from Sweet Art Lab please come forward?

287
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
他们喘息
THEY GASP

288
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
哦，哈哈，哈哈…!
Oh, luh, luh...!

289
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,480
唷!!势如破竹般的增长
Phew! Whoof!

290
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,560
看来你今天过得很愉快啊。
Well, it looks like you've had a good day.

291
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,920
我喜欢你的马卡龙淡淡的颜色。
I like the subtle colour of your macaron.

292
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,040
那么，你能告诉我们我们得到了什么吗?
So, would you be able to tell us what we've have got?

293
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,280
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

294
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,120
好的。
OK.

295
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,720
是冻住了吗?是的，冻住了。
Is it frozen? Yeah, it's frozen.

296
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,240
所以你把它冻住了?是的。好的。
So you've built it frozen? Yes. OK.

297
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,320
就像冰淇淋马卡龙。
It's like an ice cream macaron.

298
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,920
真可惜。
What a shame.

299
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,600
味道，我很喜欢。
The taste, I really like.

300
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
但我感觉不到它的质地。毫米。
But I can't feel the texture. Mm.

301
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,560
现在，我有一块冰。
At the moment, I've got a block of ice.

302
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:40,520
如果你能让我相信这是冷冻点心，
If you could have sell me that this is a frozen entremets,

303
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,800
你做到了。
you nailed it.

304
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,480
棒棒糖……
Lollipop...

305
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,480
所以，深色的是橘色的
So, the dark one is a mandarin pain de fruit

306
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,600
配上伯爵茶和黑巧克力甘纳许。
with an Earl Grey tea and dark chocolate ganache.

307
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,560
我的第一印象是它们是巨大的。
My first impression is that they are humongous.

308
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,200
我要试试。不要看。
I'm going to try. Don't look.

309
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:01,400
它的味道和它的样子一样。它很重。
It tastes as it looks. It's very heavy.

310
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,600
胡萝卜蛋糕……
Carrot cake...

311
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,120
可爱的海绵，不太干，相当轻，
Lovely sponge, not too dry, fairly light,

312
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,640
但是糖霜有点干。
but the frosting is dry a little bit.

313
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,200
我觉得你能给我们更好的。
I think you can give us better than this.

314
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,120
从视觉上看，它很美。
Visually, it's beautiful.

315
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,480
你用巧克力装饰马卡龙真是太好了。
It's quite nice that you decorated your macaron with chocolate.

316
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,040
能给我们介绍一下你的口味吗，谢谢?
Could you take us through your flavour, please, thank you?

317
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,960
这是一种麦乳精奶油，里面有咸焦糖
It's a malted milk cremeux with salted caramel inside

318
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,280
还有巧克力杏仁海绵蛋糕。
and a chocolate almond sponge.

319
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,800
我喜欢它。
I love it.

320
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,600
我真的……它的工作原理。
I'm really... It works.

321
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,080
里面的味道，我不能一整天都吃这个。
The flavour profile in there, I can't have this all day.

322
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,400
我喜欢这个。这是我的一种渴望。毫米!
I love this. It's a craving I would get. Mm!

323
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:13,960
那棒棒糖呢?这是巧克力和橘子……
What about the lollipops? This is a chocolate and orange...

324
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,080
我吃的时候会紧张吗?
Am I actually nervous to eat it?

325
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,480
我不太确定我要不要金牙。
I'm not too sure if I want golden teeth.

326
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,320
我太年轻了，不会长金牙。
I'm too young for golden teeth.

327
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,800
嗯…太厚了。
Um... That's too thick.

328
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,120
是的。大部分都是一块黑巧克力，可能会很硬。
Yeah. Most of it is a chunk of dark chocolate, which can be very hard.

329
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,360
我喜欢吗?
Did I enjoy that?

330
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,920
毫米…不是真的。
Mm... Not really.

331
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,680
那是覆盆子开心果杏仁牛轧糖。
That's a raspberry, pistachio and almond nougat.

332
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:43,000
我认为执行力很差。
I think the execution is quite poor.

333
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,560
我们来尝尝吧?
Shall we taste?

334
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,480
我觉得有点软，适合我的口味，
I think it's a little bit soft for my liking,

335
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,920
而且到处都粘着。
and it's sticking everywhere as well.

336
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,120
我觉得我不太喜欢吃这个。
I don't think I really enjoy eating this.

337
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,640
他叹了口气:轮到我们了。
HE SIGHS It's our turn.

338
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,560
轮到我们哔哔声了。
Our turn for a BLEEP.

339
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,440
最后的润色在这里，你匆忙，
The finishing touches here, you rushed,

340
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,960
你是在努力按时完成，还是…?
you were struggling to finish on time, or...?

341
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,160
是啊，这些片段都是临时安排的。
Yeah, the segments were a very last-minute thing.

342
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,680
总的来说，看起来不太好。
Well, overall, doesn't look great.

343
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,640
提醒我们马卡龙蛋糕里有什么。
Remind us what's in the macaron cake.

344
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,840
里面有橙子海绵，柑橘凝乳，
Inside we have an orange sponge, citrus curd,

345
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,000
新鲜葡萄柚血橙果冻
a fresh grapefruit and blood orange jelly

346
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,760
外面是马斯卡彭尚蒂伊奶酪。
and then a mascarpone Chantilly on the outside.

347
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:34,520
哦!Tshh !
Oh! Tshh!

348
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,800
我不需要这个，因为它看起来更像煎饼。
I would not need this because it looks more like a pancake.

349
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:44,000
而且非常潮湿。
And it's very soggy as well.

350
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,960
我唯一喜欢吃的就是你的新鲜水果
The only thing that I enjoy eating is your fresh fruit

351
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
因为它非常提神。
because it's very refreshing.

352
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,600
除此之外，我一点也不喜欢吃。
Other than that, I didn't enjoy eating it at all.

353
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,080
好了，我们有棒棒糖了。
So, we have got our lollipops.

354
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,880
首先，他们是否过于富有想象力?
First thing, are they overly imaginative?

355
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,720
不。
No.

356
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,480
那么，我们从这个开始吧?
So, shall we start with this one?

357
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,920
这是一个伟大的金融家。
This one is a gianduja financier.

358
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,920
无聊，无聊，无聊。
Boring, boring, boring.

359
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,000
砰，砰，砰!
Boing, boing, boing!

360
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:16,880
我想要更多!它也是干的。好的。对不起。
I want more! It is dry as well. OK. Sorry.

361
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,440
你能解释一下里面是什么吗?
Could you explain what is inside, please?

362
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,440
柠檬焦糖和咖啡奶油。
Lemon caramel and coffee cremeux.

363
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,280
柠檬，我觉得和咖啡不太搭。
The lemon, I don't think it works with coffee.

364
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,360
巧克力的外壳很厚。
And the chocolate shell is very thick.

365
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,600
我第一次尝到的是苦涩。
The first taste I taste is bitterness.

366
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,280
一切都是苦，苦，苦。
It's all bitter, bitter, bitter.

367
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,360
我一点也不喜欢吃这个。
And just don't enjoy eating this at all.

368
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,440
明天你有很多事要做。
You're going to have a lot to do tomorrow.

369
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,120
这不是苦的。不…
That's is not bitter. No...

370
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,560
我觉得填充物在某种程度上被压扁了。
I think that the filling is quite squashed in a way.

371
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,320
它没有展现出馅料的美。
It doesn't show the beauty of the filling.

372
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,280
提醒我里面有什么味道。
Remind me what the flavours are in there.

373
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,240
香蕉和焦糖甘纳许。
Banana and caramel ganache.

374
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,080
〇先说坏消息
Bad news first -

375
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,360
质地，有点太软了。
the texture, a bit too soft.

376
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:26,000
好消息，味道很好，我喜欢香蕉，切起来很干净。
Good news - good flavour, loved the banana, it's clean to cut.

377
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,240
做得很好。
Well done.

378
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,760
提醒我一下，这是什么?
Remind me, what is this again?

379
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,480
萨姆:这是香草味的黑貂，上面有一层酥皮，
SAM: It's a vanilla sable with a streusel on top,

380
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,040
外面是大黄果冻，
rhubarb jelly on the outside,

381
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,880
里面是焦糖苹果。
and then inside you have caramelised apple.

382
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,040
我喜欢这个概念。我觉得大黄很酸。
I like the concept. The rhubarb, I think it's very acidic.

383
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,680
然而，我确实喜欢苹果。
However, I do like the apple.

384
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,160
所以，总的来说，还可以。
So, as a whole, it's OK.

385
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,640
我还期待更多呢。下一个。
I was hoping for more. Next one.

386
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,040
这是榛子杏仁巧克力。
It's a hazelnut and almond chocolate.

387
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,960
这真的让我觉得，你知道，“吃了我”。
It really made me feel like, you know, "eat me".

388
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,040
这是个好迹象。
That's a good sign.

389
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,360
我喜欢!
I love it!

390
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,320
:哦…!
ALL: Oh...!

391
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,200
我喜欢它。我本来可以多吃点的。
I love it. I could have eat more.

392
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,920
里面有很多质地，就连涂层都很棒。
There's so many textures in there, and even the coating is sensational.

393
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,240
爱它，爱它，爱它。
Love it, love it, love it.

394
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,840
但是因为我在照顾我的身材……我不会再吃了。
But because I'm looking after my figure...I'm not going to eat more.

395
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,360
如果你事先告诉我，我们就会去那里
If you told me before we'd go out there

396
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,840
如果你这么说，我会把你的手咬下来。
and have that judging, I'd have bit your hand off.

397
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:38,640
我们已经开始开裂了，所以做马卡龙的技巧是错误的。
We are already starting cracking, so wrong technique to do the macaron.

398
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,680
你能给我们介绍一下味道吗?
Would you be able to take us through the flavour profile, please?

399
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,400
所以，这是花生甘纳许。
So, it's a peanut ganache.

400
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,920
里面有花生慕斯和焦糖花生。
It's got a peanut mousse and then caramelised peanuts inside.

401
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,200
你认为是这样吗?它是熟的吗?这就是问题所在。
Do you think so, it's cooked? That's the problem.

402
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,160
在制作的时候，我们意识到马卡龙还没有煮熟。
When it comes to build it, we realised the macaroon wasn't cooked.

403
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,800
是的。所以我们试着把它放回烤箱，然后…
Yeah. So we tried to put it back in the oven, then...

404
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,200
我们最后不得不把它造得很热。
We ended up having to build it hot.

405
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,280
. .马卡龙太热了，馅都塌了。
..and the macaron was too warm, so all the filling just collapsing.

406
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,080
这正是我们不想要的。
This is exactly what we don't want.

407
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,280
所以你的棒棒糖有很多东西要学——希望如此!
So a lot to pick up with your lollipop - hopefully!

408
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,680
这是一种蛋糕，上面撒上了橘子和香草糖浆。
So it's a pain de Gene sponge topped with a orange and vanilla syrup.

409
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,880
然后你就有了柑橘果馅饼
Then you've got a mandarin pate de fruit

410
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,880
然后是巧克力橙甘纳许。
and then a chocolate-orange ganache.

411
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
吉恩的疼痛是干的，不舒服。
The pain de Gene is dry and it's not pleasant.

412
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
不是很好。不是很好，伙计们。
Not great. Not great, guys.

413
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,160
罗曼:这是椰子和椰子朗姆酒甘纳许，还有椰子马卡龙。
ROMAIN: So it's coconut and coconut rum ganache with a coconut macaron.

414
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,880
至少这马卡龙是熟的。
At least this macaron is cooked.

415
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,560
我一点也不喜欢吃这个。
I did not enjoy eating this at all.

416
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,880
抱歉，伙计们，没关系的。
I'm sorry, guys, but not at all.

417
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
非常感谢大家。我稍后再看。
Thank you very much, guys. I will see later.

418
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,360
这是建设性的批评。
It's constructive criticism.

419
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,600
我们知道他们希望我们做得更好。
We know that they want us to do a lot better.

420
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,640
如果我们明天不催促，我们出去，
If we don't push tomorrow and we go out,

421
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,840
我们会很失望，
we will be like, you know, so disappointed,

422
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,560
因为我们没有尽力。
because we didn't do our best.

423
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,080
所以我们需要保持…是的，我们要保持乐观。
So we need to keep... Yeah, we need to keep positive.

424
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,320
明天的比赛需要两队将两者结合起来
Tomorrow's showpiece will require the teams to combine both

425
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:25,160
糖工艺品和巧克力首次在比赛中发挥作用。
sugar craft and chocolate work for the first time in the competition.

426
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,560
所以要明智地利用黄金时间来获取大的元素
So using the golden hour wisely to get any large elements

427
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,200
夜间设置将比以往任何时候都更加重要。
set overnight will be more vital than ever.

428
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
四分之一决赛上半场结束了，
First-half of the quarterfinal done,

429
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,560
公平地说，这些团队今天并没有真正交付。
and it's pretty fair to say the teams didn't really deliver today.

430
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,120
今天对所有球队来说都是艰难的一天。
It was a difficult day for all the teams today.

431
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,840
其中三家的表现稍好一些。

Sweet Art Lab做了一些好吃的东西。

他们必须明白这是四分之一决赛

440
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:05,800
下一关他们将进入半决赛。

441
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,080
“好”已经不够好了。

442
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:09,320
主题是童话故事。

你的作品必须给我们讲个故事，吸引我们

你必须做两个完全一样的主菜蛋糕。

00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,840
你必须给蛋糕上釉，而且必须有巧克力的味道。

455
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,360
记住，我们期望的是完美无缺。

这是四分之一决赛。
Well, this is the quarterfinal.

462
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,600
我们看看他们是怎么处理巧克力的，
We see what they can do with chocolate,

463
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,120
我们看到了它们对糖的作用，
we see what they can do with sugar,

464
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,320
现在是时候把它们放在一起了。
now it's time to put it all together.

465
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,080
把糖和巧克力结合起来困难重重。

我从来没把糖和巧克力混在一起过，
I've never combined sugar and chocolate together,

469
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,120
我也没见过这种事。
it's not something I've ever really seen either.

470
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:52,000
对我来说重要的是——它必须是迷人的，神奇的
What's important for me - it has to be enchanting, magical

471
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,320
带我去童话世界。

他们想让我们创造一个童话

473
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
我们觉得没有比厨房更好的地方了。
and we thought there is no better place than the kitchen.

474
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,920
为了童话故事?你要杀了我!

475

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,360
这将是他的秘方书。

00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:27,520

But it will still taste of chocolate? To me, it's more exotic.

487
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,840
必须是巧克力。好的。
It needs to be chocolate. OK.

488

他们在昨天的比赛中表现出色，

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,840
罗曼和琳恩今天要上演一出杰作。

他们选择了一个更传统的童话故事

491

那是用有色糖做的。

作为展示品，我们正在做一个城堡作为背景。

CHERISH: So is this your fairy tale, or Romain's fairy tale?

参赛队伍不仅要制作出完美无瑕的精彩表演，
Not only must the teams produce a flawless and fantastical showpiece,

570
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,520
他们还必须确保他们的恳求是完美的构造。
they must also ensure their entremets are perfectly constructed.

571
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:29,560
主菜是多层慕斯蛋糕。
An entremet is a multilayer mousse cake.

572
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,840
每一层都要告诉我一个故事。
Every layer has to tell me a story.

573
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,240
这是白巧克力。
This is white chocolate.

574
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
我们小时候不怎么吃黑巧克力。
We didn't really eat dark chocolate as a kid.

575
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,160
这些团队制作了他们多层主菜的一些元素
The teams made some of the elements of their multi-layered entremet

576
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,200
在昨天的黄金时刻。
in yesterday's golden hour.

577
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,360
他们真的很好。我对他们很满意。
They're really nice. I'm happy with them.

578
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,080
但厨师们仍然需要调味并将它们混合起来。
But the chefs still need to flavour and combine them.

579
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:50,080
我要把蛋糕浸在橙汁里。这就是底。
I'm just going to soak this cake in orange. This will be just the base.

580
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,720
我觉得主菜看起来不错。
I think our entremet is looking good.

581
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,240
只需要把白巧克力慕斯涂在上面
Just need to do the white chocolate mousse to go over the top

582
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,720
然后放进冰箱。
and then that can go in the freezer.

583
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,400
这是巧克力慕斯。
This is the chocolate mousse.

584
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,080
我把我的建反了。
I built mine upside down.

585
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,400
你会在顶部有一个漂亮的平面
You will have a nice flat surface on the top

586
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,760
然后，当你倒上釉料的时候，它就会变得又漂亮又均匀。
and then, when you pour your glaze, it will be nice and even.

587
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:08,200
为了保持它的形状，摩丝必须完全定型。
To hold its shape, the mousse must be perfectly set.

588
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,360
一片明胶在里面。
One leaf of gelatine in there.

589
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
明胶太多，吃起来会不舒服。
Too much gelatine and it will be unpleasant to eat.

590
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,440
测试几次以确保它不会太紧实
Test it a few times to make sure it is not too firm

591
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,720
给评委的，因为我知道他们不喜欢明胶。
for the judges, cos I know they don't like gelatine.

592
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,640
对琳恩来说，这意味着再次面对她的宿敌。
For Leanne, it means facing her nemesis once again.

593
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,000
是的，这是明胶。
Yeah, this is gelatine.

594
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:25,400
我们在这个食谱里把它调淡了。
We've toned it down in this recipe.

595
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,160
是不是太浓了?
Is it not too liquid?

596
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,520
上次是不是厚了很多?
Was it a lot thicker last time?

597
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,680
有一点。我不会说它更厚。
A little bit. I wouldn't say it was much thicker.

598
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,640
加两倍的明胶。是吗?
Double the amount of gelatine. Yeah?

599
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:42,800
大厨们，你们的童话已经讲了一半了，已经讲了一半。
Chefs, you are halfway through your fairy tale, halfway through.

600
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,320
随着慕斯的设置，团队将注意力转向糖。
With entremets setting, the teams turn their attention to sugar.

601
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,440
哔哔声。这里太热了。制糖的温度适宜。
BLEEP. It's scorching round here. Temperature for sugar work is fine.

602
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,840
不过这里太热了，不适合吃巧克力。
It's very warm in here for chocolate, though.

603
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,160
有这么多糖元素要构建，
With so many sugar elements to construct,

604
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:00,080
这对团队来说是至关重要的，他们开始了炎热而艰苦的转弯过程
it's vital the teams begin the hot, arduous process of turning

605
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,960
这是他们童话装饰的日常食材。
this everyday ingredient into their fairy tale decorations.

606
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
我第一次看到糖加工的时候，
The first time I ever saw sugar work done,

607
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,320
我觉得这很神奇。
I thought it was pretty magical.

608
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,480
当你拿起糖的时候，你不会觉得它是
When you pick up sugar, you don't see it as

609
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,680
变成鲜花之类的东西。
turning into flowers and stuff.

610
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,040
我做了一些带叶子的小玫瑰
I've done some little roses with a leaf

611
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,920
我做了一个球体，里面有玫瑰。
and I did a sphere with the roses inside.

612
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,800
我要把这四个都算出来。我觉得这是个不错的主意。
I'm going to do all four of them. I think it's a nice touch.

613
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,280
吹糖是一个繁琐而耗时的过程
Blowing sugar is a fiddly and time-consuming process

614
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,120
这很容易损坏。
that's prone to breakages.

615
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,040
我对制糖工作没有多少经验。
I have not much experience with sugar work.

616
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:31,040
我知道它很脆弱!
I know it's fragile!

617
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,800
糖碎
SUGAR WORK SHATTERS

618
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,920
把它弄坏了。
Broke that one.

619
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,200
尽管如此，埃迪又一次制造出了复杂的糖
Despite this, Eddie's once again making complex sugar work

620
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,480
他的展品的焦点。
the focal point of his showpiece.

621
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,400
我们有灯，有魔毯，
We've got the lamp, we've got the magic carpet,

622
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,560
这就是精灵。
and this is the genie.

623
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:44,160
我把这个放在灯下，
And I'll put this under the lamp,

624
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,760
我要把它塑造一下，让它看起来更像精灵。
and I'll just shape it, you know, to give it more that genie look.

625
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,560
这是一个冒险的决定。
It's a risky decision.

626
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,160
如果没有精心设计的精灵，他的童话就会落空。
Without a well-crafted genie, his fairy tale will fall flat.

627
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,680
糖工作粉碎哔哔!哔哔声!
SUGAR WORK SHATTERS BLEEP! BLEEP!

628
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,040
我需要重新开始。
I need to start this again.

629
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,720
我现在要拉一条缎带，那是为翅膀准备的。
I'm going to pull a ribbon now, and that's for the wings.

630
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,560
当其他团队继续他们的糖工作时，
While the rest of the teams move on with their sugar work,

631
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,640
埃迪落后了。
Eddie has fallen behind.

632
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,480
他还没有成功地吹灭他的精灵。
He's yet to successfully blow his genie.

633
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,440
艾迪和马什德，我很喜欢这个概念
Eddie and Mashid, I really like the concept

634
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,880
他们投入了他们的精灵。
they've put into their genies.

635
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,320
灯和魔毯。
Lamp and a magic carpet.

636
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,040
我们只需要看到一个完成的，熟练的展示
We just need to see a finished, skilful Showpiece

637
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,960
让他们摆渡出去。我们有巧克力块
for them to ferry out. We've got the chocolate piece

638
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,160
现在还没有和糖混合。
which at the moment is not combined with the sugar.

639
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,760
我需要看到他们付出了努力
I need to see that they've made the effort

640
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,160
把糖和巧克力混合在一起。
of combining sugar and chocolate together.

641
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:47,560
Hideko和Theo，我很喜欢南瓜的主意
Hideko and Theo, I really like the idea of the pumpkin

642
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,680
加入到主菜中
to be incorporated into entremet.

643
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,080
话虽如此，这是一个巧克力蛋糕，
Having said that, it is a chocolate cake,

644
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,840
所以我们需要感受巧克力的味道。
so we need to feel the chocolate.

645
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,680
哔哔声!哔哔声!
BLEEP! BLEEP!

646
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,840
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

647
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,600
那是魔毯。
That's the magic carpet there.

648
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,040
我不确定下一个会不会这么薄。
I'm not sure the next one's as thin.

649
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:07,960
艾迪拼命抢救更多的制糖工作
As Eddie races to salvage yet more sugar work...

650
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,960
啊!这只是在浪费时间。
Argh! It's just wasting time.

651
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,840
. .具有完整组件的组件
..those with completed components

652
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,160
现在面对技术上最复杂的建筑…
now face the most technically complex construction...

653
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,320
这是一个错误。
That was a mistake.

654
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,680
. .这是前所未有的竞争。
..the competition has ever seen.

655
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:21,360
正确的。冻结。
Right. Freeze.

656
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,000
喘息声
GASPS

657
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,440
猪。
Pig.

658
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
天气很冷，不是吗?
It's cold, isn't it?

659
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,520
凝固巧克力的冷喷雾可以打碎糖。
The cold spray that sets chocolate can break sugar.

660
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,320
以及糖融化所需的高温
And the extreme heat that sugar requires to melt

661
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,520
和巧克力不搭。
doesn't sit well with chocolate.

662
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:38,200
你有什么问题吗?
Are you having trouble sticking it together?

663
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:39,920
这要花很长时间。
That's going to take forever.

664
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,640
哇，哇，哇。
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

665
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:44,080
对不起，对不起。
GASPS Sorry, sorry.

666
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,600
你还好吗?是的。
Are you OK? Yeah.

667
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,760
我是边做边练，你懂吗?
I'm building it as it goes, you know?

668
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,800
辉煌。
Brilliant.

669
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,280
大厨们，你们还有十分钟。
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

670
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,600
现在时间紧迫。
Pushed for time now.

671
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,840
十分钟。给童年的自己写封信，
Ten minutes. Write a letter to your childhood self,

672
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,080
告诉他们你没有搞砸这个挑战。
tell them you didn't mess up this challenge.

673
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,960
哦，发生什么事了?
Oh, what happened?

674
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,080
哔哔声。我的天啊。
BLEEP. Oh, my God.

675
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:05,480
参赛队伍不仅要完成他们的展示作品，
Not only must the teams construct their Showpieces,

676
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:08,160
他们还必须给主菜上釉
they must also get their entremets glazed

677
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,640
及时让它们凝固。
in time for them to set.

678
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,440
伙计，白的颜色不够亮。
Man, the white's not coming out enough.

679
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,480
格莱兹看起来不错。真的闪闪发光。
Glaze looks all right. Really shiny.

680
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,720
哦!
Oh!

681
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:16,720
慢慢来。我没有时间做更多的事情了。
Take your time. I won't have time to do more.

682
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,360
学了很多东西。
Leaning a lot, that.

683
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,160
哦,巴拉特。
Oh, Bharat.

684
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,360
是啊，但你一把它放上去…
Yeah, but soon as you put it on there...

685
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,520
哇，哇，哇。你必须非常小心
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You have to be really careful

686
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:31,800
否则它就会打散。不要这样做。
otherwise it'll just shatter. Don't do it.

687
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,080
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

688
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,640
先放一个在上面。
Put one of them on top there for now.

689
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,760
是的。什么在开裂?
Yeah. What is cracking?

690
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,880
破解不!
CRACKING No!

691
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,240
快，快，快。
Quick, quick, quick.

692
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,400
我们没有放足够的明胶。不会持续太久的。
We didn't put enough gelatine in. Not going to last.

693
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,760
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

694
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,960
哦，你这个笨蛋。
Oh, you piece of BLEEP.

695
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,360
咆哮
GROWLS

696
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,680
我要穿上它!
I want it on!

697
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,680
大厨们，你们还有一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left.

698
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,280
这是一分钟。
That's one minute.

699
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,920
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

700
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
哔哔声!
BLEEP!

701
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,960
大厨们，你们的时间到了!
Chefs, your time is up!

702
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,520
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

703
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,040
钟在报时。
The clock is chiming.

704
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,040
您的马车在等您。
Your carriage awaits.

705
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,040
希尔顿酒店看起来棒极了。
The Hilton's looks fantastic.

706
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,240
对此我很难过。
So gutted about this.

707
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,600
五部奇幻童话，
Five fantastical fairy tale showpieces,

708
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,840
还有他们的巧克力点心，
and their accompanying chocolate entremets,

709
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:55,320
但哪一项将为他们的球队赢得半决赛席位呢?
but which will earn their team a place in the semifinal?

710
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,120
这就是我所说的展示品。
That is what I call a showpiece.

711
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:10,320
我们看到的每一个地方都有故事。
Everywhere we look there is a story in there.

712
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,840
我真的很喜欢你秘方里的泡泡。
I really like the bubble that you incorporate to the secret recipe.

713
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,640
当你看到这小小的关注时，
When you see the little attention here,

714
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:19,680
那个锅和下面的火焰，我真的很喜欢。
that pot and the flames underneath, yeah, I really like that.

715
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:22,360
当然，你的策略是对的，也就是
Of course, you got with the right strategy, which is

716
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,200
用巧克力使其达到最大的高度，体积和强度
work with chocolate to get maximum height, volume, strong

717
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,400
结构和带来更轻，更精致的糖元素之后。
structure and bring your lighter, more delicate sugar element after.

718
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,800
你的主菜里有什么?
What's inside your entremets?

719
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:36,680
芒果香草果冻白巧克力慕斯，
White chocolate mousse with mango and vanilla jelly,

720
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:39,080
百香果果冻和香草海绵。
passion fruit jelly and vanilla sponge.

721
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,120
繁荣。
Boom.

722
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,520
真的很喜欢吃巧克力慕斯。
Really enjoy eating the chocolate mousse.

723
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,840
我喜欢你放新鲜芒果进去。总的来说，还不错。
I like it when you put the fresh mango in. Overall, it's nice.

724
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,080
这是个美味的蛋糕，有百香果和芒果。
It's a pleasant cake, you get the passion fruit, you get the mango.

725
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,960
就像我吃的是水果点心，而不是巧克力蛋糕。
It's like I've got a fruit entremets, not a chocolate cake.

726
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,680
哦，亲爱的上帝，救救我们吧。
Oh, dear God, help us.

727
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,040
我不知道他们当时是怎么做到的。
I don't how BLEEP they got that done in the time.

728
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
我真的不知道。
I really don't.

729
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,600
就这样，四分之一决赛的准备工作都完成了吗?嗯嗯。
This is it, all your work for the quarterfinal is done? Mm-hm.

730
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,320
看起来像你想要的吗?事情没有按计划进行。
Does it look like you wanted? Things didn't go to plan.

731
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,720
这是一种视觉效果，颜色的对比很好
Well, there is a visual, there is a nice contrast of colour which

732
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,120
带来了一点童话的元素。
brings a little bit of the fairytale element.

733
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:34,560
我们有一些糖，一些缎带。
We've got some sugar work, some ribbon.

734
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:37,520
显然，我们看到那里发生了一些事情。
Clearly, we see that something has happened there.

735
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,200
当然，我希望再高一点。
Of course, I would have hoped a little bit of height.

736
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,440
我认为这个概念是存在的。
I think the concept is there.

737
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,800
当我看到蘑菇的时候，感觉很粗糙，
When I look at the mushroom it's quite heavy-handed,

738
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:49,560
但是那边的蘑菇，我觉得它们看起来很可爱。
but the back mushrooms over there, I think they look really cute.

739
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,040
蛋糕是牛奶巧克力和橘色海绵蛋糕，
The cake is milk chocolate and orange sponge base,

740
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,840
浸泡在橙汁中。
soaked in orange syrup.

741
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,400
最上面的一层是草莓凝胶，
A layer on top of that is the strawberry gel,

742
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,280
还有一份白巧克力甘纳许。
and a white chocolate ganache.

743
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,560
我能感觉到白巧克力奶油冻。
I can feel the white chocolate cremeux.

744
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:10,680
我得到了橙色和草莓果冻的对比。
I get the contrast of the orange and strawberry jelly.

745
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,400
口感对我来说很棒。
The texture, for me, is great.

746
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:16,080
它摸起来很像奶油，但是釉有点粘。
It does feel very creamy but the glaze is a bit sticky.

747
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,040
明胶，你可以再加一点，
The gelatine, you could have added maybe just a touch more,

748
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,680
再加几克，这样蛋糕就撑起来了。
a few grams more, so that the cake is propped.

749
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,720
现在蛋糕正在下垂。巧克力慕斯还可以。
At the moment the cake is sagging. The chocolate mousse is OK.

750
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,160
然而，海绵并不令人愉快。
However, the sponge is not enjoyable.

751
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,640
你是否与时间作斗争?
Did you struggle with time?

752
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,400
我们差不多都搞定了，
Oh, we got everything pretty much done,

753
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,440
但是我们发生了一些事故，我们必须解决一些问题。
but we had a couple of accidents and we had to fix a couple of problems.

754
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,520
我记得你跟我提过飞毯。是的。
I remember you mentioned a flying carpet to me. Yes.

755
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,960
飞毯在哪里?
So where is the flying carpet?

756
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,280
嗯，最上面的几块巧克力掉下来碎了
Well, the top pieces of chocolate had fallen down and broke

757
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,600
那个大的，我已经做了一半。好的。
the big one that I had done in half. OK.

758
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:59,720
我会来到这张桌子上，把它当作一个展示品吗
Will I come to this table and see this as a showpiece

759
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:04,560
哪个是直的，灯里的精灵?
which is straight, the genie in the lamp story?

760
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,600
不。
No.

761
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,080
这是一盏灯，可能是一个茶壶，
This is a lamp, could be a teapot,

762
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:14,440
蓝色的部分是平的，没有字符。
and that blue thing here is flat, there is no character.

763
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,040
剩下的只是一个球，一个圈，几个漩涡。这是不够的。
The rest is just a ball, a loop, a few swirls. It is not enough.

764
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:23,320
我真心希望你的蛋糕好吃。
I really hope your cake tastes amazing.

765
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,600
底部是巧克力海绵，里面是百香果
On the bottom is a chocolate sponge and then inside is a passion fruit

766
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,120
凝乳，异国果冻和巧克力慕斯。
curd, exotic jelly and chocolate mousse.

767
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,320
巧克力慕斯口感很顺滑。
Chocolate mousse is quite smooth and nice.

768
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,720
我很喜欢百香果凝乳，非常柔滑。
Really like the passion fruit curd, it's really creamy.

769
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,400
我唯一不喜欢的是海绵。
The only thing that I don't really enjoy is the sponge.

770
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,480
我认为那里非常非常干燥。
I think it's very, very dry.

771
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,440
马希德，你的巧克力慕斯做得很好，做得很好。
Your chocolate mousse, Mahshid, is well done, well executed.

772
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,520
它是美丽的。谢谢你！
It's beautiful. Thank you.

773
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,000
百香果和它一起可以起作用。对我来说，太多了。
The passion fruit with it can work. For me, there is too much of it.

774
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:54,080
缺少的是质地。
What's missing is texture.

775
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:57,640
所有东西都是软的，所以有点无聊。是的。
Everything is soft and for that, it's a bit boring. Yeah.

776
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:13,600
你能告诉我巧克力在哪里吗
Would you be able to show me where the chocolate

777
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:17,320
这些糖实际上是一起起作用的吗?
and the sugar has actually been working together?

778
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:21,960
是的，我用巧克力画了城堡的屋顶
Yes, so I've done the roof of the castle in chocolate

779
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,760
还有巧克力城堡的入口。
and a sort of entrance for the castle in chocolate.

780
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:27,440
这是入口吗?我以为是月亮。
Is that an entrance here? I thought it's a moon.

781
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:29,160
这可能是一个烟囱。
And this could be a chimney.

782
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,240
或者是城堡，烟囱，城堡。
Or, yeah, it's a castle, chimney, castle.

783
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:36,240
但这很好。谢谢你！
But this is nice. Thank you.

784
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,200
罗曼就是罗曼，一点糖不会害死人的，
Romain being Romain, a little bit of sugar doesn't kill anyone,

785
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:42,200
我看到了你工作的技巧
and I see the finesse in your work.

786
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,360
当你说公主的时候，我看到了很多潜力。
I see a lot of potential when you said princess.

787
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:50,120
但是钻石在哪里?皇冠上的闪光在哪里?
But where's the diamond? Where's the glitter on the crown?

788
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,640
让我们看看蛋糕能不能送货。
Let's see if the cake delivers.

789
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,840
丽安:这是一块巧克力海绵，上面有一层巧克力脆皮。
LEANNE: So it's a chocolate sponge, got a chocolate crunchy layer.

790
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,680
在上面有一层焦糖。
On top of that it's got a caramel layer on.

791
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:01,320
上面是巧克力慕斯，上面是柠檬汁。
It's got a chocolate mousse and then on top of that it's got a lemon glaze.

792
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,160
我喜欢你平衡蛋糕的方式。
I like the way you balance your cake.

793
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,600
里面有很多口感。我喜欢它。真的。
There's plenty of texture in there. I like it. I really do.

794
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,400
我很喜欢底部的海绵，
I really like the sponge at the bottom,

795
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,480
焦糖和脆脆的元素，一切都在一起。
the caramel and the crunch element, everything goes together.

796
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,680
非常愉快。
It's very pleasant.

797
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,360
我要说的第一件事是，注意你的明胶。
The first thing I'm going to say is, watch your gelatine.

798
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,680
然而，它尝起来真的很好吃。两人:谢谢。
However, it tastes really nice. BOTH: Thank you.

799
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,720
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

800
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,720
它非常迷人，非常迷人，非常神奇。
It's very enchanting, it's very fascinating, it's very magical.

801
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,000
你有橙色的，蓝色的，粉色的。
You've got orange, you've got blue, you've got pink.

802
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:51,120
巧克力的成分，现在我正在努力寻找。
The chocolate element, at the moment I'm trying to look.

803
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,000
巧克力，那是巧克力吗?是的。下面呢?
Chocolate, is that chocolate? Yeah. Underneath?

804
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,240
但这对我来说不算是装饰。
But that doesn't consider as the decoration for me.

805
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,320
马车，我很喜欢它的设计。
The carriage, I really like the design.

806
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:02,200
很明显，你有问题，但这件事本来可以做得很好
You had issues, clearly, but this could have been done neatly

807
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,120
它会完美地工作。
and it would have worked perfectly.

808
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,000
尝尝你的主菜。
Taste your entremets.

809
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:08,720
下面是一层南瓜籽，
It's a pumpkin seed streusel on the bottom,

810
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,960
然后是杏仁巧克力Moelleux白巧克力
and then it's almond and chocolate Moelleux, white chocolate

811
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,080
kabsu namelaka和南瓜白巧克力kabsu慕斯。

812
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:26,000
南瓜吗?是的。尝不出南瓜的味道。
Pumpkin? Yes. Can't really taste the pumpkin.

813
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,560
黑巧克力海绵蛋糕是布朗尼型的吗?
The black chocolate sponge is a brownie type?

814
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,160
在巧克力Moelleux上。
On the chocolate Moelleux.

815
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:33,200
我喜欢它。我非常非常喜欢这种口感。
I love it. I really, really like that texture.

816
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:38,160
不干，口感丰富，还有巧克力的味道。
It's not dry, it's rich and there is the chocolate flavour.

817
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,760
你有很棒的想法，
You have brilliant ideas,

818
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,800
但有一些最后的修饰显然是你无法做到的。
but there is some finishing touches you clearly can't manage to achieve.

819
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:49,680
我希望如果你们继续前进，你们能解决这个问题。
I hope if you are moving forward, that you can address this.

820
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:00,200
根据他们在两项挑战中的表现，
Based on their performance in both challenges,

821
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,880
Benoit和珍惜现在将对球队进行排名。

822
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:06,520
最后一名的队伍将无缘半决赛。

823

824
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,400
当珍爱站出来说，哇，
When Cherish stepped up and was just like, wow,

825
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:13,080
我就想这就是我一直在等待的

我一直在等待一个惊喜的时刻!

EMMANUEL: We hope it's good enough to get to the semifinal.

828
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,520
啊，太不整洁了。
Ah, it's very untidy.

829
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,200
我对我们的现状很满意，
I'm content with where we've got,

830
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,800
但我们仍然渴望继续前进。
but we still have that hunger to keep going forward.

831
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:26,680
在这场比赛中，你永远不会安全。
You're never safe in this competition.

832
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,960
如果我们必须出去，那就是游戏，你懂吗?
If we have to go out, then that's the game, you know?

833
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:36,200
Benoit和珍惜已经做出了决定。
Benoit and Cherish have made their decision.

834

847
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:47,280
我不得不说。你们应该为自己感到骄傲。
I have to say. You should be proud of yourselves.

848
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:50,080
你应该为自己感到骄傲。最后伯努瓦向我们走来。
You should be proud of yourself. Benoit came up to us at the end.

849
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:52,680

He knows all we can do. And he's seen what we can do.

850
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,920
他们仍然知道我们能做什么。
They still know what we can do.

851
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,480
祝贺你。
Congratulations.

852
00:45:57,520 --> 00:46:00,640
伊曼纽尔:首先，我们非常高兴。
EMMANUEL: In first place, we are more than happy.

853
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:03,360
这种感觉真的很好，我迫不及待地想要进入画板
It does feel really good, can't wait, to get to the drawing board

854
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,640
看看我们要为半决赛设计什么。
and see what we are going to design for the semifinal.

855
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,280
真是难以置信。我一点也不相信。不，我以为我们要去。
It's quite unbelievable. I didn't believe that at all. No, I thought we was going.

856
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,760
我们相信你。
We believe in you.

857
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,440
半决赛!
Semifinal!

858
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:19,200
下次……天气很热，不是吗?. .这是半决赛。
Next time... It's very heated, isn't it? ..it's the semifinal.

859
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,400
时不再来。
Now or never.

860
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:22,400
一个有转折的秘方挑战…
A secret recipe challenge with a twist...

861
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,560
哦,哔哔声。
Oh, BEEP.

862
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:27,520
. .还有现场电镀的美食戏剧……
..and the gastronomic drama of live plating...

863
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:31,160
他们想要戏剧。今天是你们的舞台。
They wanted theatre. You own the stage today.

864
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,200
. .随着一支队伍进入决赛的机会落下帷幕。
..as the curtain falls on one team's chance of reaching the grand final.

1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,760
欢迎回到《职业烘焙大赛》，
Welcome back to Bake Off: The Professionals,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,040
现在只剩下四支队伍争夺三个名额了
where we're down to just four teams battling it out for the three places

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,880
在下周的决赛中。太让人兴奋了,
in next week's final. So exciting,

4
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,560
真不敢相信已经进入半决赛了，利亚姆，
I can't believe it's the semifinal already, Liam,

5
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,120
我不知道该穿什么!兄弟，没事的，你看起来很好。
I don't know what to wear! Bro, it's OK, you look good.

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
利亚姆，谢谢你，这对我意义重大。我想知道厨师们会穿什么?
Oh, Liam, thank you, that means a lot. I wonder what the chefs will wear?

7
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:17,280
汤姆，他们差不多每周都穿同样的衣服。
Er, Tom, they kind of wear the same thing every week.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,240
他们吗?是的。天啊，这太缺乏想象力了。
Do they? Yeah. Jeez, that's so unimaginative.

9
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,480
我想知道他们会创造什么?毫无疑问，有些事很疯狂。
I wonder what they'll create, though? Something insane, no doubt.

10
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,960
海绵，焦糖，巧克力漩涡。
Mm, sponge, infused caramel, chocolate swirls.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,160
鸡蛋花。利亚姆，求你了，别这么叫我，别当着这些人的面。
Frangipani. Liam, please, don't call me that, not in front of these guys.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,880
最后一次……
Last time...

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,880
. .四分之一决赛使两队回到了童年时代。
..the quarterfinal took the teams back to childhood.

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,360
哇哇哇!
Aww!

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,080
对于希尔顿公园巷的伊曼纽尔和山姆，一个迷人的创作…
For the Hilton Park Lane's Emmanuel and Sam, an enchanting creation...

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,080
这就是我所说的展示品。
That is what I call a showpiece.

17
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,680
. .意味着童话般的结局。
..meant a fairy tale ending.

18
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:52,480
第一名，伊曼纽尔和萨姆，你们晋级半决赛了。
First place, Emmanuel and Sam, you are through to the semifinal.

19
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,400
但对萨沃伊的埃迪和马希德来说，前景不容乐观。
But for the Savoy's Eddie and Mahshid, the outlook was grim.

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,120
他们的半决赛希望……
And their semifinal hopes...

21
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,800
这个，作为一个展示品，不。
This, as a showpiece, no.

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,760
. .消失在一缕烟雾中。
..vanished in a puff of smoke.

23
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,360
我祝愿所有其他球队在这方面好运。
I wish all the other teams the best of luck in this.

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,320
这一次……欢呼。. .最后四支球队……
This time... Cheers. ..the last four teams...

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,280
天气很热，不是吗?
It's very heated, isn't it?

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,440
. .为进入决赛决一死战。
..battle it out for their place in the final.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,160
机不可失，时不再来。
It's now or never.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,840
他们将面对一个秘密配方，还有一个转折……
They'll face a secret recipe, with a twist...

29
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,160
她现在压力太大了。
It's a lot of pressure on her, at the moment.

30
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
. .还有美食剧场
..and the gastronomic theatre

31
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,280
带电电镀。
of live plating.

32
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,280
跳伞，高空绳索。
Parachuting, zip wiring.

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,360
火,烟。
Fire, smoke.

34
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,000
谁值得再来一次?
Who will deserve an encore?

35
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,040
他们想要戏剧。哇!
They wanted theatre. Woo!

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,040
和谁
And who

37
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,360
会被嘘下台吗?
will be booed offstage?

38
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,680
只有四支有天赋的队伍留在比赛中，
Just four talented teams remain in the competition,

39
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,200
但决赛只能有三名选手。
but there can only be three finalists.

40
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,720
我们现在都在努力赢得比赛，每个人都和我们一样努力训练。
We're all in it to win it now, and everyone's training just as hard as us.

41
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,360
我们走了那么远并不只是为了进入半决赛。
We didn't come that far just to finish in the semifinal.

42
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,200
在内心深处，我们想进入决赛，这是肯定的。
Deep inside, we want to be in the final, that's for sure.

43
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,280
我们要战斗到底。是的。毫米。
We're going to fight to the finish. Yep. Mm.

44
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:19,120
他们的第一个试验是一个独一无二的秘方。
Their first test is a secret recipe, like no other.

45
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,600
这是什么?也许他们只是想让我们放松。
What is this? Maybe they want us just to relax.

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,000
两队关系中的任何弱点都将暴露出来。
Any weaknesses in the teams' relationships are about to be exposed.

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:38,040
欢迎来到半决赛，大厨们。
Welcome to the semifinals, chefs.

48
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,760
这是一条漫长而艰辛的道路
It's been a long and arduous road to get

49
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,600
为了这个阶段的比赛，为了我们所有人。
to this stage of the competition, for all of us.

50
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,000
我秃顶了，利亚姆开始刮胡子了，
I've gone bald, and Liam's started shaving,

51
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,440
但今天，它将变得更加艰难。
but today it's about to get even tougher.

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:54,080
没错，厨师们，因为今天你们将面对另一个秘方
That's right, chefs, because today you'll be facing another secret recipe

53
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,960
挑战。只是，对于这个，
challenge. Only, for this one,

54
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,600
评委们发明了一个新的难度等级。
the judges have invented a new level of difficulty.

55
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:02,440
我们想让你做一道法式甜点，浮叶。
We would like you to make a French dessert, ile flottante.

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,360
它必须包含某种形式的英式奶油，一种煮熟的蛋白霜，
It must include some form of creme anglaise, a cooked meringue,

57
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,320
至少吃一种水果，最后加糖。
at least one fruit element, and finish with sugar work.

58
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,880
你们中只有一个人可以做今天的秘方。
Only one of you will be allowed to make today's secret recipe.

59
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,040
怎么啦？哔哔声。
What? BLEEP.

60
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,440
恐怕另一个人只能袖手旁观了，
The other one will have to sit this one out, I'm afraid,

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,520
而且只能作为旁观者提供建议。
and only be able to advise from the sidelines.

62
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,000
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

63
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,960
现在你们有两分钟的时间来决定今天谁来做
Now you have two minutes to decide which of you will be making today's

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,160
秘方，现在就开始这两分钟。
secret recipe, and those two minutes start now.

65
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
哦,哔哔声…你想做饭吗?
Oh, BLEEP... You want to cook?

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,560
还是我做饭?
Or I cook?

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,720
我不介意。如果我指导你，你会不会感觉好点，
I don't mind. Would you feel better if I directed you,

68
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,600
还是你在指挥我?
or you directing me?

69
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:49,480
要确保进入决赛，不仅要看你有多好，
To guarantee a place in the final, it is not just about how good you are,

70
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,320
这是关于团队合作，他们必须完全信任彼此。
it is about teamwork, and they will have to trust each other completely.

71
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,320
这个挑战是非常技术性的。
This challenge is very technical.

72
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,040
他们的知识至关重要。
Their knowledge is crucial.

73
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,840
选错了人会导致他们的失败。
Choosing the wrong person will be their downfall.

74
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
大胆去做吧。
Go for it.

75
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,360
是吗?是的。
Yeah? Yeah.

76
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,080
随它去吧。
Let it be.

77
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:12,480
大厨们，你们的两分钟时间到了。
Chefs, your two minutes is up.

78
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,840
不参加的厨师会吗
Would the chef who is not taking part

79
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,680
在今天的秘方挑战中，请
in today's secret recipe challenge, please

80
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,600
在工作站尽头的凳子上坐下?
have a seat on the stool at the end of your work station?

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,760
我好怕!
I'm BLEEP scared!

82
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,040
大厨们，你们有两个半小时的时间来完成这个挑战，
Chefs, you have two and a half hours to complete this challenge,

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:36,160
你的时间从现在开始。
and your time starts now.

84
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,760
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

85
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
让我们来看看。
Let's see.

86
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:44,560
Benoit和珍惜给了团队最少的指导。
Benoit and Cherish have given the teams minimal guidelines.

87
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,200
我们必须想出我们自己的食谱?
We have to come up with our own recipes?

88
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,120
主厨，有食谱吗?
Chef, was there a recipe?

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
好吧，只是问问。好的,很酷。
OK, just asking. OK, cool.

90
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,680
这就是你得到的。浮岛，或浮岛，
That's what you get. The floating island, or the ile flottante,

91
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,560
用法语说就是蛋白霜
as we say in French, is meringue,

92
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,040
浮在英式奶油上。
which will float on a creme anglaise.

93
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,800
最重要的是，我们加入了水果元素，
Crucially, we've added a fruit element,

94
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,240
这需要结合起来。
which needs to be incorporated.

95
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,560
总会有一点焦糖在上面。
There is always a little bit of caramel spun sugar on it.

96
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,000
有了它，你可以创造体积，你可以创造形状。
With that you could create volume, you could create shape.

97
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,880
它必须是美味和精致的。
It has to be delicious and exquisite.

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,080
他们必须把所有的味道混合在一起，为我们做出一种wowser。
They have to combine all the flavours together to make it a wowser for us.

99
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,400
有了各种各样的食材
With an array of ingredients at their disposal...

100
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,840
. .他们可以是传统的……
..they can be as traditional...

101
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,920
我要做一个樱桃树莓果冻。
I'm going to do a cherry and raspberry jelly.

102
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,680
树莓泥……或者发挥他们的创造力。
Raspberry puree. ..or as creative as they like.

103
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,320
对于Sweet Art Lab的Hideko和Theo，
For Sweet Art Lab's Hideko and Theo,

104
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,000
这意味着又一次试验的机会。
this means another chance to experiment.

105
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,760
你放的是什么利口酒?
What liqueur are you putting in?

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,120
我们要在里面放一点朗姆酒。
We're going to put a little bit of rum in there.

107
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,320
这将是异国情调的水果。
It's going to be exotic fruit ile flottante.

108
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,880
冰镇果汁朗姆酒。你已经完成了你的涂鸦，
Pina Colada. And you've done your little scribbling,

109
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,560
所以你是负责把食谱写下来的人，对吗?
so you are the one in charge of writing the recipe down, are you?

110
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,960
是的。Hideko，一个人的感觉如何?
Yeah. How does it feel, Hideko, to be by yourself?

111
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,720
超级高压，不是吗?
Super high pressure, isn't it?

112
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,280
只是一点点压力!
Just a little bit of pressure!

113
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,520
只有一点点!
Just a tiny bit!

114
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,600
蛋白霜在机器里。
The meringue's in the machine.

115
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,040
这是最重要的部分。
It's the most important part.

116
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:03,160
浮岛是一种蛋白派。
A floating island is a meringue.

117
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,000
不出所料，flottante是由，
An ile flottante, is made, unsurprisingly,

118
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,400
配法式蛋白酥皮。
with French meringue.

119
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,360
但是名胜世界的Darryl和Bharat……
But Resorts World's Darryl and Bharat...

120
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,760
我们用的是意大利蛋白霜，因为它能让蛋糕更饱满。
We're using Italian meringue, because it gives it a bit more body.

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,320
. .把规则手册扔出窗外。
..are throwing the rule book out of the window.

122
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,480
意大利蛋白霜，我们加热糖
The Italian meringue, we heat the sugar

123
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,800
然后倒入搅打好的蛋白霜中。它更健壮。
and then pour it into the whipped meringue. It's more robust.

124
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,720
Darryl,巴拉特……
Darryl, Bharat...

125
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,000
你好。显然，因为你对鸡蛋过敏…
Hello. Obviously, because you have an egg allergy...

126
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,880
是的。所以我尝不出这个。
Yes. So I can't taste this.

127
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,400
这就是为什么我要信任我忠实的伙伴。
This is why I'm putting my trust in my faithful sidekick.

128
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,080
你觉得当我的跟班怎么样?
How do you feel about being a sidekick?

129
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,600
我以为你们是两个英雄。
I thought you were like two heroes.

130
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,160
因为你留着布鲁斯·韦恩式的发型，
Because you've got the, like, Bruce Wayne kind of haircut,

131
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
你绝对是超人。
and you're definitely Superman.

132
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,760
用氪石。氪石就是蛋。
With the kryptonite. The kryptonite is the egg.

133
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,680
鸡蛋，对!
The egg, yeah!

134
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,960
不像名胜世界，他们的团队里有法国人，
Unlike Resorts World, with a Frenchman on their team,

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,280
皇家咖啡厅酒店应该有优势。
Hotel Cafe Royal should have an advantage.

136
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,880
但罗曼选择了袖手旁观。
But Roman has elected to sit on the sidelines.

137
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,520
你感觉怎么样?嗯…
How are you feeling? Well...

138
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,280
. .为她感到紧张。为她吗?
..stressed for her. For her?

139
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,440
我们很惊讶你是坐在这里的人。
We are surprised you are the one sitting down here.

140
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:09,640
你已经吃遍了法国的所有美食很多年了。
You've eaten all of France has to offer for many, many years.

141
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
是的。你今天尝不出它的味道。
Yes. And you can't taste it today.

142
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,160
不。我真希望当时在那里。
No. I would have preferred to have been there.

143
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,440
但罗曼并没有让我选择!
But Roman didn't really give me a choice!

144
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,920
你们要为进入决赛而战。
You're fighting for a space in the final.

145
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,320
你有多自信?
How confident are you?

146
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
信心就像漂浮的岛屿!
The confidence is floating like the island!

147
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,120
布丁是最好的证明!
The proof is in the pudding!

148
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,560
大厨们，你们还有一小时，还有一个半小时。
Chefs, you've had one hour, you've got an hour and a half left.

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,280
我现在要吹箫了。
I'm going to pipe now.

150
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,640
选择正确的方法来制作蛋白霜是至关重要的。
Choosing the correct way to cook their meringue is essential.

151
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,240
这将决定他们的岛屿是漂浮还是沉没。
It will determine whether their islands float or sink.

152
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:46,320
蛋清非常蓬松，就像吃空气一样。
It's very fluffy, the egg white, it's like eating air.

153
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,640
Hideko和Theo选择了一条捷径…
While Hideko and Theo have opted for a short cut...

154
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,360
试着用微波炉做饭。
Trying to cook in a microwave.

155
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:57,760
越来越大!. .其他球队则坚持传统。
Getting bigger! ..the other teams are sticking with traditions.

156
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,160
我们要蒸蛋白霜，慢慢煮蛋白霜，
We are going to steam the meringue, so slowly cooking the meringue,

157
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,800
很好，加了水。
nicely, with water.

158
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,760
希望这能给它增加一些高度和结构。
Hopefully that will give it some more height and structure.

159
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,280
但希尔顿公园巷的伊曼纽尔和山姆已经决定担心
But Hilton Park Lane's Emmanuel and Sam have decided that worrying about

160
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,520
一个蛋白霜是不够的。
one meringue isn't enough.

161
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,720
你打算怎么烹饪你的浮岛?
How are you going to cook your floating island?

162
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:20,480
经典的风格，就是挖走十件。
The classic style, which is to poach ten pieces.

163
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,120
那么，煮你的蛋白霜需要多长时间?
So, how long will it take to poach your meringue?

164
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,520
这是我们必须凭感觉去做的事情。
That's something we're going to have to go by the feeling.

165
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,160
我妈妈过去常常在半小时内完成。
My mum used to do that in half an hour.

166
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,440
你妈妈很好。整个浮岛。
Your mother was very good. The whole floating island.

167
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,640
我希望你妈妈能来帮我们一把!
I would love your mother to be here and give us a hand!

168
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,640
大厨们，你们还有一个小时。
Chefs, you have one hour left.

169
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,280
厨师们，你们得站好。
Chefs, you've got to stay on your stools.

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,200
是我。
It's me.

171
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,240
压力中心。
Stress central.

172
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,280
参赛队伍必须包含至少一种水果元素。
The teams must include at least one fruit element.

173
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,600
山姆可能会在蛋白霜里做果冻。
Sam's might going to make fruit jelly to go inside the meringue.

174
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,600
百香果和芒果凝胶，蛋白霜放在凝胶上，
Passion fruit and mango gel, so the meringue sits on the gel,

175
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,240
它不会变得那么湿。
and it doesn't get that soggy.

176
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,680
流动的果冻会导致甜点潮湿。
Runny jelly will result in a damp dessert.

177
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,960
我们用覆盆子，
We're using raspberry,

178
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,920
希望我们能把它设置好。
so hopefully we can get it set.

179
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,000
这还不是他们要担心的全部。
And that's not all they have to worry about.

180
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,640
英式奶油也需要在冰箱里放上一段时间。
The creme anglaise also needs time in the chiller...

181
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,720
. .但伊曼纽尔和山姆必须等待。
..but Emmanuel and Sam have to wait.

182
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,720
我们要用之前煮过的牛奶来做英式奶糊。
We're going to use the milk that we used to poach to make the anglaise.

183
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,080
很明显我们在做这个，我们不能做英式英语，
We are obviously doing that, and we can't do the anglaise,

184
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,080
所以我们显然在减速。
so we are obviously slowing down.

185
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,680
本来就应该是这样吗?
Is that how it's supposed to be?

186
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,600
它是用微波炉煮的。
It is microwave cooked.

187
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:41,120
快，快，快!完美的蛋白霜应该是雪白的……
Move, move, move! A perfectly cooked meringue should be snowy white...

188
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,520
闻闻，闻起来很有鸡蛋味，不是吗?
Smell it, it smells very eggy, no?

189
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,280
. .稍微收缩一下……
..and shrink slightly...

190
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,520
哦，是的，那很好。
Oh, yeah, that's good.

191
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,080
. .所以它很容易从模具中滑落。
..so it slides easily from the mould.

192
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,400
它粘住了吗?
Did it stick to it?

193
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,560
哦!
Oh!

194
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
哔哔声。哦，喷雾剂，
BLEEP. Oh, the sprays,

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,960
我们不能一直用喷雾剂，对吧?
we can't do stick with the spray, no?

196
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
好的，我们再做一个蛋白霜。
OK, let's do another meringue.

197
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,000
是的。另一个酥皮。
Yep. Another meringue.

198
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:21,160
我们有多久了?大厨们，你们还有半个小时，
How long have we got that? Chefs, you have half an hour left,

199
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,280
那是半个小时。
that's half an hour.

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,920
带上所有的部件。
Bring all the components.

201
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,760
我们正在改变一切。
We are changing everything.

202
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,760
当琳恩和罗曼开始做蛋白霜的时候…
While Leanne and Roman start meringue number two...

203
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,120
. .伊曼纽尔和萨姆在追赶他们的英式奶油。
..Emmanuel and Sam play catch up with their creme anglaise.

204
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,200
他必须很快地把它冷却下来。
He's going to have to cool it down very, very quickly.

205
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,320
如果不凉……
If it doesn't cool...

206
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,280
冰箱，冰箱，冰箱，冰箱。
Freezer, freezer, freezer, freezer.

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,680
萨姆从现在起就得赶紧了。
Sam's going to have to rush from now.

208
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,880
他们的蛋白霜也会崩溃。
Their meringue will also collapse.

209
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,720
我把它分成了四个碗，我把它分成了四个碗。
I've split it into four bowls, I've split it into four bowls.

210
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,120
不够的。加油，加油，加油，加油。
Not enough. Come on, come on, come on, come on.

211
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,560
还是没设置好。那你想做什么?
It's still not set properly. Well, what do you want to do?

212
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,640
也许放进裱花袋里。
Maybe into a piping bag.

213
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,200
是的。把它舀出来。你还有，大概半小时吧?
Yeah. Scoop it out. You've still got, what is it, half an hour left?

214
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:17,640
我想20分钟吧。大厨们，你们还有15分钟，就15分钟。
20 minutes, I'd say. Chefs, you have 15 minutes left, that's 15 minutes.

215
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,480
我们走，我们走，我们走。
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

216
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,080
走，走，走，走，走。在侧面，对吗?
Go, go, go, go, go. In the side, yeah?

217
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,520
侧边哔哔。
BLEEP the side.

218
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,400
怎么样?没有完成。
How is it? Not done.

219
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:36,000
为了完成他们的漂流计划，各队必须面对最后一个障碍……
To complete their ile flottante, the teams must face one final hurdle...

220
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,080
你能说多少就说多少，巴拉特。
As much of that as you can, Bharat.

221
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,920
. .糖的工作。这是……
..sugar work. This is...

222
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,760
哔哔声。抱歉，它滑得到处都是。
BLEEP. Sorry, it slides all over the place.

223
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,040
加油，甜心!
Come on, sugar!

224
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,880
小心你的手指!
Watch your fingers!

225
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,640
她现在压力太大了。
It's a lot of pressure on her at the moment.

226
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,760
大厨们，你们有十分钟的时间完成你们的浮船。
Chefs, you have ten minutes to finish off your iles flottantes.

227
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,880
这是怎么回事?
How is this?

228
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,640
它上升了一点。是吗?
It's come up a little bit. Yeah?

229
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,120
那就不要煮过头。
Then don't overcook it.

230
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,800
哦!
Oh!

231
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:12,640
哔哔声。加油，Hideko，你能做到的!
BLEEP. Come on, Hideko, you can do it!

232
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,160
这是煮熟的。它脱落了吗?
It's cooked. Is it coming off?

233
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,000
是吗?
Is it?

234
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,560
它不会一起出来。
It's not coming out together.

235
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,360
怎么样?喜欢,坏的。
How is it? Like, bad.

236
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,520
嗯?坏的。
Huh? Bad.

237
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,560
坏的?
Bad?

238
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,400
就是这样。但是我们可以把它切开。
That is what it is. But we can cut it up.

239
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,640
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left.

240
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,160
没关系。
It's OK.

241
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,440
小心!
Watch your backs!

242
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,720
好了，停下，哇，哇，哇。不要让它流血。
Right, stop, whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't let it bleed.

243
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,640
如果他们想要更多的话，可以在旁边放一些。
Maybe put some on the side, if they want more.

244
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
我想这就够了。这是足够的。
I think this is enough. It's enough.

245
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,080
再放一个进去。快点，快点，
Put another one in there. Make it quick, make it quick,

246
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,400
你还有一分钟，伙计。你要把你的岛放在上面。
you've got one minute to go, mate. You've got your island to go on the top.

247
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,720
蛋白糖饼……把它往下推一点。
Meringues... Just push it down a little bit.

248
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:09,920
不要太多，不要太多。越高越好。
Not too much, not too much. As high as you can.

249
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,960
也许是上下颠倒。
Maybe upside down.

250
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,560
来吧……
Come on...

251
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,640
是的，是的，是的。
Yes, yes, yes.

252
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,760
7点就可以了，不是吗?7点就可以了。
Seven's fine, no? Seven is fine.

253
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,800
用力推……
Give a good push...

254
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,440
是的，看起来不错。
Yeah, looking good.

255
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,640
大厨们，你们的时间到了。
Chefs, your time is up.

256
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,560
就是这样。
That's it there.

257
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:35,720
请把您的彩带到展示台。
Please bring your iles flottantes to the display table.

258
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,760
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

259
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,200
半决赛选手们现在面临着评判
The semifinalists' iles flottantes now face the judgments

260
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,880
伯努瓦和珍爱。
of Benoit and Cherish.

261
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
这是给你的。哦。
This is for you. Oh.

262
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,320
贿赂。这就是贿赂。
Bribery. That is called bribery.

263
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,920
我没有什么可做的，所以我就带了我有的。
I had nothing to cook, so I just bring what I've got.

264
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:17,120
所以我得到了浮岛，而珍爱得到了花。是的,抱歉。
So I got the floating island and Cherish got the flower. Yeah, sorry.

265
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,680
好吧,表示。
OK, presentation.

266
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,240
到处都是大块的焦糖。
There's big blocks of caramel everywhere.

267
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,480
棉花糖试图避免这些小珍珠。
Spun sugar is trying to avoid all those little pearls.

268
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,480
它的边缘有点粗糙。
It's a little bit rough around the edges.

269
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,800
果盘是一种百香果芒果。
Compote is a passion fruit mango.

270
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,400
摸起来柔软一点。
Feels a bit softer.

271
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,640
嗯，浮岛已经沉入海底了。
Well, the floating island has sunk under the sea.

272
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:43,400
微波蛋白霜的质地非常湿润，
The microwaved meringue is very watery kind of texture,

273
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,200
虽然我觉得果冻很好吃，你不这么认为吗?
although I think the jelly is really tasty, don't you think so?

274
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,640
但是没有浮岛。
But there is no floating island.

275
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,240
还没烤好。所以零，零。
It's not baked. So zero, zip.

276
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,800
不管怎样，非常感谢。
Anyway, thank you very much.

277
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,880
再见。谢谢你！
See you later. Thank you.

278
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:56,920
谢谢你！把你的花拿回去，西奥。但没有成功。
Thank you. Take your flowers back, Theo. It didn't work.

279
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,400
嗯，我们可以看到桌子上有一个很高的浮岛。
Well, we can see a floating island on the table that is high.

280
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,280
有棉花糖。你有一些音量。
There is spun sugar. You got some volume.

281
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,600
水果做得不错。
Nice work with the fruit.

282
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,640
它是五彩缤纷的。
It's colourful.

283
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:17,200
我们有芒果菠萝果汁，覆盆子果汁。
We have mango and pineapple compote, raspberry compote.

284
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,240
选错蛋白霜了。意大利蛋白霜，让它变得很粘稠。
Wrong choice of meringue. Italian meringue, makes it very moussy.

285
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,720
没有那种胶状的烹饪方法。
You haven't got that gelatinous kind of cooking.

286
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:32,600
与蛋清相比，糖的含量太高了，
The sugar content is too much compared to the egg white,

287
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,840
所以它很甜。
so as a result it is very sweet.

288
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,520
然而，如果我把它和水果一起吃，它就会平衡。
However, if I ate it together with the compote it sort of balances it.

289
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,720
水果的味道很好。
The fruit element is nice.

290
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,040
非常感谢大家。
Thank you very much, guys.

291
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,080
干杯，谢谢。
Cheers, thank you.

292
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,560
糖出了什么问题?
What went wrong with the sugar?

293
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
太迟了。对我来说，这是未完成的事业。
Left it too late. For me, it's unfinished business.

294
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:01,080
话虽如此，我还是喜欢你做的每个碗，
Having said that, I like the fact that you've done individual bowls,

295
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,800
让我们尝一尝。
but let's taste it.

296
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,480
我们在糖里加了一点牛轧糖。
We've added a touch of nougatine to the sugar.

297
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,640
在你的浮岛中央
In the middle of your floating island

298
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,920
你应该吃点樱桃果冻。
you should have some cherry jelly.

299
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,520
我很喜欢你往蛋白派里塞的果冻，
I quite like your jelly that you pipe into the meringue,

300
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,080
因为人们没有预料到这一点，当你切过去的时候，会有一个很好的
because people don't expect that and when you cut through there's a nice

301
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,120
里面有惊喜。
surprise in there.

302
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,840
我相信你的蛋清很硬。
I believe your egg whites are firm.

303
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,240
甜度很棒。
The sweetness is great.

304
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,840
话虽如此，我个人还是更喜欢一些东西
Having said that, I would personally have preferred something

305
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,440
更奢侈一点。你知道吗，你可以去异国情调。
a little bit more extravagant. You know, you could have gone exotic.

306
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,680
你今天的创作不够原创。
It's not original enough, your creation today.

307
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

308
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,960
是啊，别再发出哔哔声了。
Yeah, not to do this BLEEP thing again.

309
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,880
罗曼，琳恩，对今早的挑战不后悔吗?
Romain, Leanne, no regrets with this morning's challenge?

310
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,440
我想我也会这么做的。
Um, I would have done it I think.

311
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,600
这和我期待的剧情差远了。
Well, it's far from the drama I was expecting.

312
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,040
不是最有想象力的，对吧?
Not the most imaginative, I would say, yeah?

313
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:08,280
我们看到小蛋白派，
We see little meringues,

314
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,840
如果它们是附加的，我不介意
which I don't mind if they are an addition

315
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,080
去一个美丽的浮岛，
to a beautiful floating island,

316
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:16,000
我很难在底部看到。
which I struggle to see at the very bottom.

317
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,600
它只是一个立方体，一个小立方体。
It's only the cube, the little cube.

318
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,560
这是唯一的一座浮岛吗?
Oh, so this is the only floating island there is?

319
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,360
是的，它不是从模子里出来的，
Yes, it was not coming out of the mould,

320
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,760
所以我们只能把剩下的东西弄得可爱一点。
so we had to get cute with what was left, basically.

321
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,760
这是朗姆酒浆果果盘。
So you've got a rum and berry compote.

322
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:31,440
看起来有点像伊顿公学的烂摊子。
It looks a little bit like an Eton mess.

323
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,760
就味道而言，我喜欢配苹果汁。
Flavour wise I like the compote to go with it.

324
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,840
基本上就是蛋白霜和浆果。
It's meringue and berries, basically.

325
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:44,520
这只是两份的份量。
This is only two portions size.

326
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,120
我们要求6到8小时。
We asked for six to eight.

327
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
你没有完成简报。
You did not meet the brief.

328
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,080
我们要求一个浮岛，你没有满足的简要。
We asked for a floating island, you did not meet the brief.

329
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,800
明天我真的很想去看看。
Tomorrow I really want to see.

330
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,880
谢谢你！谢谢你！谢谢大家。
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, guys.

331
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
事情就是这样。很好。明天就是一场噩梦。
It is what it is. Fair enough. Tomorrow, it's a nightmare.

332
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,560
不结束就不算结束。完全正确。
It's not over until it's over. Exactly.

333
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,440
好吧，让我们忘记它，让我们明天更强大地回来。
OK, let's forget it and let's come back tomorrow stronger.

334
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,000
我们不会退居二线然后说，哦，是的，
We're not going to take the back seat and say, oh, yeah,

335
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,440
我们已经搞定了。是啊，我们明天肯定有比赛。
we've nailed this one. Yeah, we've definitely got a fight tomorrow.

336
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,480
明天的现场电镀盛典需要更多的个性元素
Tomorrow's live plating extravaganza requires more individual elements

337
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,680
比之前的任何展览都好
than any showpiece that's come before it,

338
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:29,920
所以今晚的黄金时段是取得成功的重要机会。
so tonight's golden hour is a vital chance to get ahead.

339
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,840
所以今天的秘方挑战很难，
So today's secret recipe challenge was a tough one,

340
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
我想可以这么说。
I think it's fair to say.

341
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,480
希尔顿公园巷，他们做得怎么样?
Hilton Park Lane, how did they do?

342
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,520
我真的很享受父子关系。
I really enjoyed the father and son partnership.

343
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,560
他们俩合作得很好。
They both worked together so well.

344
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:44,600
正如我们所知，伊曼纽尔用蛋糕造出了山姆，然后他变成了一个
As we know Emanuel built Sam out of cake and then he came to life as a

345
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,360
魔法学徒，所以说得通。
magic apprentice, so it makes sense.

346
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Darryl和Bharat，他们是从最底层开始的
Darryl and Bharat, they've been going from the bottom

347
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,880
敬一个进入决赛的有力竞争者。
to a very strong contender to go to the final.

348
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:57,040
皇家酒店咖啡厅和甜蜜艺术实验室，
Both Hotel Cafe Royal and Sweet Art Lab,

349
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:00,160
目前它们几乎没有浮动。
they are barely floating at the moment.

350
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,040
压力很大，因为他们正在为决赛而战。
Pressure is on because they are fighting for the final.

351
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,360
早....
Morning.

352
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:23,680
早上好，厨师们。
Good morning, chefs.

353
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,800
我们希望你从昨天的不可能任务中恢复过来，
We hope you've recovered from yesterday's mission impossible,

354
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:31,840
因为今天，评委们决定重新设计表演挑战
because today, the judges have decided to reinvent the showpiece challenge -

355
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,760
剧透警告-他们并没有让它变得更容易。
and spoiler alert - they've not made it any easier.

356
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,920
我是说，我试着对他们说，学期快结束了，我们不能都看个视频吗?
I mean, I've tried to say to them, it's nearly the end of term, can't we all just watch a video?

357
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,320
但那就像铅蛋奶酥一样。
But that went down like a lead souffle.

358
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,640
那么，法官们，你们能解释一下今天的考验吗?
So, judges, would you be kind enough to explain today's ordeal?

359
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,200
我是说——表演挑战?
I mean - showpiece challenge?

360
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
厨师们，今天，我们要为你制作最壮观的蛋糕
Chefs, today, we would like you to make the most spectacular cake you

361
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,240
至少做过三层。
have ever made, at least three tier.

362
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,800
今天挑战的主题是冒险。
The theme for today's challenge is adventure.

363
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,440
所以你还必须创建一个
So you must also create a further

364
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,360
12个组件，然后在我们面前直播。
12 components which you will then plate up in front of us live.

365
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,960
你的表演必须非常精彩。
Your performance needs to be spectacular.

366
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,840
厨师们，你们有四个小时。
So chefs, you have four hours.

367
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,720
时间从现在开始。
The time starts now.

368
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:21,760
好，好，好。
OK, OK, OK.

369
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,600
这个三层蛋糕是他们做过的最大的蛋糕
The three tiered cake is the largest cake they've ever been asked to make

370
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,360
为了比赛。
for the competition.

371
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,440
它必须足够大，能喂饱40个人。
It must be big enough to feed 40 people.

372
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
如果有人对我说，
If someone normally said to me,

373
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,040
你得去做一个三层蛋糕，
you had to go and do a three-tiered cake,

374
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,440
你不可能在四小时内做好。
you wouldn't have it ready in four hours.

375
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,920
但这还不是全部。
But that's not all.

376
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,440
也会有现场电镀，
There will be live plating as well,

377
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:45,080
既令人兴奋又令人畏惧。
so exciting and daunting at the same time.

378
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:49,360
这道美味的甜点就是在这里制作出来的
Live plating is where a spectacular dessert is created

379
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,640
就在你眼前。
in front of your eyes.

380
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:56,040
这是表演时间，现场电镀，三层蛋糕，
This is showtime, live plating, three tiered cake,

381
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:59,800
他们要准备什么才能让这一切一起工作和创造
which they will have to prepare to make it all work together and create

382
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,440
一个伟大的爱冒险的观众。
a great adventurous spectator.

383
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,720
这是最颓废和最具戏剧性的美食表演艺术。
This is gastronomic performance art at its most decadent and dramatic.

384
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,960
我想要惊喜。
I want to be surprised.

385
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,040
我想看到运动。
I want to see movement.

386
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,960
我希望他们与我接触。
I want them to engage with me.

387
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,800
我想在桌子上看到爆炸和烟火。
I want to see explosion and firework on the table.

388
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,520
我所期望的不会比这少。
I expect nothing less than that.

389
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,120
哇。他们想要更健康的，就给他们更健康的。
Wow. They want it fitter, give them fitter.

390
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,160
这是一个演示，也许是Benoit。
This is a presentation, maybe Benoit.

391
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,120
早上好。
Good morning to you.

392
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,560
早....事情进展如何?
Morning. How did it go?

393
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:37,280
我们对你将要想出的东西很感兴趣。
We are so intrigued with what you're going to come up with.

394
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,200
你现在的设计是怎样的?
What's the story of your designs today?

395
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:45,320
这个故事就像生存，生存到侏罗纪世界，
The story is like surviving, surviving into a Jurassic world,

396
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,600
像恐龙。
like dinosaurs.

397
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,880
对于我们这样的幸存者来说，这是一个非常危险的挑战。
This is a very risky challenge for survivors like us.

398
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:53,080
所以你带着你的生存本能。
So you bring your survival instinct.

399
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:57,440
是的，每一个挑战，几乎死了但还活着。
Yes, every single challenge, almost dead but still alive.

400
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,840
在令人失望的第一天之后，
After a disappointing first day,

401
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,760
Sweet Art Lab的Hideko和Theo
Sweet Art Lab's Hideko and Theo

402
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,360
希望它们的侏罗纪经历能拯救它们免于灭绝。
hope their Jurassic experience will save them from extinction.

403
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,480
它的特色是貂色饼干骨头、恐龙蛋和香草，
It will feature sable biscuit bones, dinosaur eggs and vanilla,

404
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,200
抹茶巧克力雪纺海绵火山蛋糕，
matcha and chocolate chiffon sponge volcano cakes,

405
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,640
会喷出覆盆子熔岩和液氮烟。
which will spew molten raspberry lava and liquid nitrogen smoke.

406
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,760
这可能很危险。

我们不会吃掉任何液氮。

We're going to have to survive this one, to be honest with you.

你要打扮成幸存者吗?

413
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,480
你可能会感到惊讶。你可能会感到惊讶!
You might be surprised. You might be surprised!

414

在半决赛中幸存下来也是头等大事

有座摇摇晃晃的桥，有点像丛林桥。

420
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,920
我们要砸碎一些会掉下来的巨石。

在旅程结束时制造烟雾效果。

这就是你在黄金时段做的事吗?

00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,880
这就是我们今天要做的。

黄金时间也差不多。

你今天有什么计划?

每个人都在跑步，这就是策略。

在希尔顿公园巷，他们正在计划一些更多的东西

我们要去加勒比海风格的地方，

让我有心情去巴巴多斯。

之后我带你走。要让她保持甜蜜

否则我不确定我还有什么可回去的。

他们还提供了合适的椰林酒。
And they are serving up proper pina coladas.

454
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,080
会点鸡尾酒。
Got a bit of cocktail making.

455
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,840
你基本上是在策划贿赂。
You are planning a bribery, basically.

456
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,560
有人听我说过这个词吗?
Has anybody heard that word coming from me?

457
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:52,040
这是演出的一部分，是娱乐。
It's part of the show, it's entertainment.

458
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,240
我当然是在逗你。
I was teasing you, of course.

459
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:59,200
那么这就足够让你进入决赛了吗?我当然希望如此。
So is that going to be enough to take you through to the final? I certainly hope so.

460
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,640
它将。是的。信念。
It will. Yeah. Conviction.

461
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,280
是的,当然!
Yes, definitely!

462
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,360
是的,当然有。
Yes, definitely.

463
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,920
说到冒险，
When it comes to adventures,

464
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,640
度假村世界的Darryl和Bharat的乐趣理念就没那么新奇了。
Resort World's Darryl and Bharat's idea of fun is a lot less exotic.

465
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,840
主题是什么?我们称它为伟大的户外，
What's the theme? Call it the great outdoors,

466
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,920
因为我经常出去露营，冬天不带帐篷。
because I quite often go out camping, without tents in the winter.

467
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
哇。你就带着睡袋去吗?
Wow. You just go with a sleeping bag?

468
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,600
是啊，我们可以搭个庇护所或者就在星空下睡觉。
Yeah, we'll make a shelter or we'll just sleep under the stars.

469
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:29,120
我去露营。你呢?
I go camping. Do you?

470
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,160
哦,哈哈。
Oh, ha-ha.

471
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,000
他们粗糙的伪装蛋糕将用木槿花装饰

黑加仑果冻和黑巧克力慕斯。
blackcurrant jelly and dark chocolate mousse.

474
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,360
他们的罗勒凝胶和黑莓布丁应该
Their live plating elements of basil gel and blackberry brulees should

475
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,400
唤起对英国荒野的探险。
evoke an expedition to the wilds of Britain.

476
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,600
这能让你进入决赛吗?我希望如此。
Is it going to get you through to the final? I hope so.

477
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:58,240
我觉得味道和外观完全不同，
Flavours and the look are completely different, I think,

478
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:02,000
它有…烤豆，培根?这主意不错。
it has... Baked beans, bacon? That's not a bad idea.

479
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,560
香肠。是的,是的。
Sausages. Yeah, yeah.

480
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,760
在阁楼上放了太久的睡袋的味道。
The smell of a sleeping bag that's been in a loft for too long.

481
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,720
是的。我看过国家电视台。
Yeah. I've watched Countryfile.

482
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,920
蛋糕准备好了。
The cake is ready.

483
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,640
我可以建造它。但由于时间限制，
I can build it. But with the time limit on it,

484
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,080
这真的不那么令人欣慰。
it's not really that comforting.

485
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
三个蛋糕要做。
Three cakes to do.

486
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:24,480
所以很忙，很忙，很忙。
So it's busy, busy, busy.

487
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,600
一定要用力。
Definitely have to push.

488
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,040
希望不要花太长时间定型。
Hopefully it won't take too long to set.

489
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:32,440
但制作三层蛋糕只是战斗的一部分。
But making the three tiered cake is just part of the battle.

490
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
大厨们，你们已经完成一半了。
Chefs, you are halfway through.

491
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,080
还剩两个小时。
So that's two hours left.

492
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,840
这些团队还有另一项艰巨的任务。
The teams have another mammoth task.

493
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,760
创建12个带电电镀元素。
Creating the 12 live plating elements.

494
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:51,040
这是芒果泥，看起来像生鸡蛋。
This is mango puree, it looks like a raw egg.

495
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,480
他们越有野心……
The more ambitious they are...

496
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,080
我们要敲开其中一个椰子。
We'll crack one of these coconuts.

497
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,320
他们进入决赛的机会就越大。
The more chance they'll have of making it through to the final.

498
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:05,360
时间总是不够用，这就是问题所在。
Never have enough time here, that is the problem.

499
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,480
这座桥差不多完工了。
The bridge is pretty much done.

500
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,680
哦,哦。
Oh, oh.

501
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,640
但Leanne和Romain的冒险却止步不前。
But Leanne and Romain's adventure has been stopped in its tracks.

502
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

503
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,080
重建桥梁，如果我可以的话。
Rebuild the bridge, if I can.

504
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,920
来吧!
Come on!

505
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:30,920
哔哔声。
BLEEP.

506
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,720
没有桥，他们的轰动性表演
Without a bridge, their blockbusting performance

507
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,680
没有大结局。
has no grand finale.

508
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,840
这将是一座断桥。
It will be a broken bridge.

509
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,240
大厨们，你们还有一个小时。
Chefs, you have one hour left.

510
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,280
那是一个小时!
That's one hour!

511
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,160
小心点。
Be careful with that.

512
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,520
虽然大多数团队可以继续建造他们巨大的
While most of the teams can push on constructing their gigantic

513
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:08,240
分层蛋糕……我得说，感觉很紧张。
tiered cakes... I must say, it feels quite tense.

514
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:13,040
不幸的是，由于时间不够，我们承受了很大的压力。
A lot of pressure on us, unfortunately, due to a lack of time.

515
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,360
. .琳恩和罗曼正在努力挽救他们摇摇欲坠的桥，
..Leanne and Romain are battling to save their rickety bridge,

516
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,800
他们的盛典中最引人注目的明星。
the star attraction of their extravaganza.

517
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,160
哔哔的声音
BEEP

518
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,320
它在我手里融化了。所以罗曼和琳恩，
It's melting in my hand. So Romain and Leanne,

519
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,440
我注意到已经有几处裂缝了。
have noticed there was already a couple of cracks.

520
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,040
但是，嘿，他们非常专注。
But, hey, they are very focused.

521
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,200
在希尔顿公园巷，他们正在做一个巨大的巧克力摊。
And Hilton Park Lane, they are making a huge chocolate stand.

522
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,760
展台会像电镀一样被赋予生命吗?
Is the stand going to be brought to life as well as the live plating?

523
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,120
因为他把全部精力都放在证人席上了。
Because he's focusing all his energy on the stand.

524
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,920
伯努瓦，那名胜世界呢?
But Benoit, what about the Resorts World?

525
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:49,120
他们要去乡下某个地方露营。我喜欢露营!
They are going camping somewhere in the countryside. I love camping!

526
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,640
我有点担心。
I've got a little concern.

527
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:53,840
你用它做了什么让它变得特别?
What is it that you do with it to make it special?

528
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,400
他们会不会太过安全?
Will they go a little too safe?

529
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,000
还有Hideko和Theo
And we've got Hideko and Theo -

530
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,520
侏罗纪世界。
the Jurassic World.

531
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,720
在过去，这总是一个好概念。
In the past, it's always good a concept.

532
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,520
然而，糟糕的交付。
However, poor delivery.

533
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,480
我希望他们今天能来。
I hope they're going to make it today.

534
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,840
我要用力。
I need to push.

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,160
来吧!希尔顿公园巷，你好!
Come on! Hilton Park Lane, hi!

这足以让你进入决赛吗?这是你进入决赛的门票吗?
Is this going to be good enough to get you to the final? Is this your ticket to the final?

537
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,680
因为我们有期末考试。这就是我们现在得到的。
Cos we've got the final. That's what we've got now.

538
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,880
我真的希望如此。在规定的时间内，我们会尽可能多地去。
I really do hope so. We're going as much as we possibly can do in the time frame.

539
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,320
它是热带。你最喜欢的鸡尾酒是什么?
It's tropical. What's your favourite cocktail?

540
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,480
色情明星马提尼。色情明星马提尼?
Porn Star Martini. A Porn Star Martini?

541
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:30,920
山姆，我完全没想到你会这么说!
Sam, that's not what I expected you to say at all!

542
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,640
大厨们，你们还有半小时。
Chefs, you have half an hour left.

543
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,800

今天天气很紧张。
It's got very tense today.

546
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,800
不过这是决赛的一个名额。我们希望看到你做得好。
It's a place in the finals, though. We want to see you do well.

547
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,680
所以我现在就得做。对不起，如果你不介意的话。
So I need to do it now. Sorry, if you don't mind.

548
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,200
我必须这么做。哦!我必须这么做。
I have to. Oh! I have to.

549
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,240
我很抱歉。我必须这么做。
I'm sorry. I have to.

550
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,240
蛋糕，放进去。
The cakes, get in there.

551
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,920
即使他们的蛋糕活过来了……
Even if their cakes are coming to life...

552
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,680
.除非他们把所有的电镀道具都准备好了，准备好了，
.unless they have all their live plating props stood by, ready for action,

553
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,000
他们的表演仍有可能失败。
their performance could still be a flop.

554
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,480
在压力下。这些还没弄好。
Under pressure. Still got these to ball up.

555
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:15,520
有冰淇淋，热巧克力慕斯，黑加仑豆腐。
There's ice cream, warm chocolate mousse, blackcurrant curd.

556
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,040
用于带电电镀。
For the live plating.

557
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,640
芒果格兰尼塔丸子。
Mango granita balls.

558
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,440
芙蓉酥皮。我们想让它们看起来有点像石头，
Hibiscus meringue. We wanted them to look a bit like rocks,

559
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,640
所以他们……
so they're...

560
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,680
他们了。有很多事要做。
They're cracked. A lot to do.

561
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,400
机不可失，时不再来。
It's now or never.

562
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,360
大厨们，你们还有十分钟。
Chefs, you have ten minutes left.

563
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,040
哔哔的声音
BEEP

564
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,240
这些花瓣用来装饰我们的蛋糕。
These petals to decorate our cake.

565
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,320
哔哔的声音
BEEP

566
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:47,880
从那里面拿不出一个。他们都被卡住了。
Can't get one out of that. They're all stuck.

567
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:54,120
快!加油，加油，加油，加油!
Quick! Come on, come on, come on, come on!

568
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:56,920
以马内利!

569
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,520
以马内利!我需要一些帮助。
Emmanuel! I need some help.

570
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,880
底座不是平的。
The base wasn't flat.

571
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,800
它在疯狂地摇晃。
It's wobbling like crazy.

572
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,840
我要你拿着那个。
I need you to hold that.

573
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,760
我选了一个合适的角度。
Went for a proper angle on that one.

574
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,440
我只需要它能粘住……停!
I just need it to stick... Stop!

575
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,400
停止移动顶部!这不是粘……
Stop moving the top! It's not stick...

576
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,320
注意你在蛋糕上的位置，因为我不想让你毁了整个…
Watch where you put it on the cake cos I don't want you to ruin the whole...

577
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,800
大厨们，你们还有一分钟。
Chefs, you have one minute left.

578
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
哔哔的声音
BEEP

579
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,920
有时间，伙计!
Got a minute, mate!

580
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,160
当然是在压力之下。
Under pressure, of course.

581
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,160
哔哔的声音
BEEP

582
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
真是一场噩梦!
What a nightmare!

583
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,760
推动!以马内利!
Push! Emmanuel!

584
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:18,480
大厨们，你们的时间到了!你的时间到了!
Chefs, your time is up! Your time is up!

585
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,280
天Moley !
Holy Moley!

586
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,040
我迫不及待地想看到它的实际应用。
I can't wait to see it in action.

587
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:51,400
四个令人惊叹的三层蛋糕和几十个活电镀元素，
Four stunning three-tiered cakes and dozens of live plating elements,

588
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,560
全部在五小时内完成。

589
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,480
现在决赛的席位岌岌可危，
And now with a place in the final at stake,

590
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,280
舞台已经搭建好了。
the stage is set.

591
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,200
好了，伙计们，让我们开始吧。好戏上演。
Well, guys, let's get this show on the road. Showtime.

592
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,960
这是我们的椰子。我们代表小岛。
This is our coconut. We're kind of representing little islands.

593
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,680
一些酸橙和鱼子酱。
Some lime and caviar.

594
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080

598
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,400
我用冰镇果汁朗姆酒来助兴。
I help all of this with some pina colada...drinks.

599
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,440
哇!
Woo!

600
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,320
哦，天哪，天哪。
Oh, my, my, my.

601
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,680
我爱它，爱它，爱它。
I love it, love it, love it.

602
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,840
向你鞠躬。
And my bows to you.

603
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,800
谢谢你！哇。你让我觉得我现在真的在晒太阳，
Thank you. Wow. You make me feel like I am actually suntanning now,

604
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,640
喝着我的果汁朗姆酒。
having my pina colada.

605
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:46,080
你为我们送上了一道美丽的，充满异国情调的甜点。
You've delivered a beautiful, exotic display of dessert.

606
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,000
欢呼。
Cheers.

607
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,200
你能给我们一块蛋糕吗?
If you could serve us perhaps a slice of your cake?

608
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:54,200
这是菠萝馅饼。
Got pineapple confit.

609
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,320
有椰子慕斯。
Got a coconut mousse.

610
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,280
我不太确定。
I'm not too sure.

611
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:12,280
让我有点失望的是你的蛋糕，
What is perhaps a bit disappointing for me is in your cake,

612
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,200
我希望那是真正的椰林果汁朗姆酒
which I was hoping to be truly pina colada,

613
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,800
椰子比其他任何东西都多。
was more coconut than anything else.

614
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:22,080
但是，您引入的所有元素实际上都绑定在一起。
However, all the elements that you bring in really bind together.

615
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:26,080
我看不出盘子上的错误。
I can't spot a mistake on the plate.

616
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:27,880
谢谢你！桑特。
Thank you. Sante.

617
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,000
欢呼。
Cheers.

618
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,720
我们要带大家经历一场地图上的冒险
Well, we're gonna take us through an adventure to the map

619
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:40,480
去真正找到宝藏。把它拿走。

没关系。
That's OK.

624
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,120
哦吼!
Woohoo!

625
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,760
我认为这很有趣。我们玩得很开心，不是吗?
I think it's good fun. We had fun, didn't we?

626
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,560
是的。好的。
Yes. OK.

627
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:39,080
我可以继续，就像…
I can continue, just like...

628
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,000
这部分很有趣。
That part is fun.

629
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:45,280
但我敢说，这有点笨拙，
But it's a little bit, should I dare say, clumsy,

630
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:49,200
比如，当我们看到你在焦糖焦糖焦糖布丁时。
i.e. when we saw you caramelising your creme brulee.

631
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:54,640
烧得太猛了，桌子都要熔化了。
So much firing that you could potentially melt the table down.

632
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,960
这种蛋糕很过时。
The cake is quite old-fashioned.

633
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,600
我希望你能带来一些很禅意的东西，
I was hoping that you'd bring in something that is quite Zen,

634
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,360
一些很前卫的东西，因为我知道你们俩能做什么。
something that is quite avant-garde, because I know what you two can do.

635
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,280
请给我们来一片。
Please, serve us a slice.

636
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,880
我怎么看蛋糕就是我现在怎么吃。
How I look at the cake is how I'm eating now.

637
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,040
没有烟花。
There's no firework.

638
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,840
只有来自百香果的活力。
There is only the zing that is from the passion fruit.

639
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,640
没有小爆炸。
There's no chitty bang.

640
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
我能说"大爆炸"吗?奇蒂砰砰。
Can I say chitty bang? Chitty bang bang.

641
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,400
没有“小砰砰”。
There's no chitty bang bang.

642
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:35,120
但泡沫，凝胶和格兰尼塔让你的调色板焕然一新。
But the foam, the gels and the granita refresh your palette.

643
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,560
我认为这个想法和意图很好。
The idea, intention, I think, is great.

644
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,920
谢谢你！谢谢你的努力。谢谢你！
Thank you. Thank you for all your effort. Thank you.

645
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,080
都是关于恐龙的。
All about dinosaur.

646
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:57,880
所以，是的，这是在侏罗纪冒险中生存。
So, yeah, it's surviving in a Jurassic adventure.

647
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
音乐:约翰·施特劳斯二世的蓝色多瑙河圆舞曲
MUSIC: The Blue Danube Waltz by Johann Strauss II

648
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,640
舞蹈的编排，袅袅的烟雾。
The choreography, the smoke that is bubbling away.

649
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,480
今天是你们的舞台。
You own the stage today.

650
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:29,720
侏罗纪世界与分子天文学相遇。
The Jurassic world meets molecular astronomy.

651
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:34,160
哇!伙计们，你们把我困在这里了。
Wow! You know, guys, you've got me here.

652
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:38,200
我都笑掉裤子了。裤子了吗?
I'm laughing my pants off. Pants off?

653
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,400
但它们仍然开着。还开着，还开着。
But they are still on. They're still on, they're still on.

654
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:44,360
我只希望你的味道能传达出来。
I just hope your flavour profile delivers.

655
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,880
我感觉自己像在吃鸡蛋。
I felt like I was eating egg.

656
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:04,800
然而，里面有一种水果的味道。
However, it was a fruity element that's inside there.

657
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,520
真的很喜欢吃。
Really enjoyed eating it.

658
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,280
我们有三种口味的雪纺蛋糕。
We've got the chiffon cake with three flavours.

659
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:14,720
香草，巧克力和抹茶。
Vanilla, chocolate and the matcha.

660
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,600
真的把我带回了童年
Really take me back to my childhood

661
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,120
就像我妈妈给我做雪纺一样。
as how my mum make the chiffon for me.

662
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,640
非常感谢。
Thank you very much.

663
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:27,360
我现在真的很想念我妈妈。
And I now really miss my mum.

664
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,720
我感觉不到雪纺蛋糕的味道，
The flavour combination within the chiffon cake, I don't sense,

665
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,720
因为你所有的成分都含有太多的酸度。
because there is so much acidity on all your components.

666
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,760
话虽如此，我还是喜欢你的巧克力。
Having said that, I love your chocolate.

667
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,480
我最喜欢的部分是，
And the part I really enjoy,

668
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,120
实际上，是覆盆子醋酱。
actually, the raspberry vinegar coulis.

669
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,040
干得好。谢谢你！谢谢你！谢谢你！
So well done. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

谢谢。

00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,480
谢谢。
Arigato.

672
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,840
这是关于户外的故事。
It's the story of the outdoors.

673
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,600
请给我们一个惊喜。
Please, surprise us.

黑莓火烧后。

680
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,600
大厨，你跟我说露营的事时，
Chef, when you were telling me about your camping,

681
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,240
我非常兴奋。
I got all excited.

682
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,440
我梦到烧烤了。
I was dreaming about barbecuing.

683
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,360
我梦见马在四处小跑。
I was dreaming about horse trotting around.

684
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:02,240
然而，当我看到你怎么装盘的时候，我有点泄气了。
However, when I started to see how you plate it, I get a bit deflated.

685
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,880
这有点令人失望。你们都很安全。
It's a bit disappointing. You guys have been safe.

686
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:07,640
蛋糕里可能还会有更多。
There might be more to come in the cake.

687
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:12,720
我们有巧克力慕斯，黑加仑果冻，榛子海绵。
We have a chocolate mousse, a blackcurrant jelly, hazelnut sponge.

688
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
我喜欢吃你的蛋糕，
I enjoy eating your cake,

689
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,360
有了巧克力，还有你放进去的慕斯，
you know, with the chocolate, the mousse that you put in,

690
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:27,840
但没有什么能点亮你的蛋糕，让它充满活力。
but there's nothing to lit up your cake and bring it alive.

691

When it comes to Hideko and Theo's theme, all is not what it seems.

所有的甜点和所有的展示都会看起来像什么
All the dessert and all the display is going to look like something

事实并非如此，或多或少。不是它的东西?
which it's not, more or less. Something which it's not?

是的，所以你不确定它是不是一种食物。
Yes, so you're not sure, like, if it's a food.

159

所以评委们会不会有吃桌子的危险
Oh, so is there a risk that the judges will start eating the table

160
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,760
因为他们觉得这可能是甜点?这是……这是令人担忧的。
cos they think it might be a dessert? That's... That's a worry.

161
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:14,200
所以，人们会问:“这是手提包还是甜点?”
So, people go, "Is it a handbag or is it a dessert?"

162

我要尽我所能来演。

现在，这是你的黄金时刻。

00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:03,040
这将是我们的展示桌。哦，我明白了。
It's going to be our presentation table. Oh, I see.

179
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,920
在你说之前，它们不是芸豆。
Before you say it, they're not kidney beans.

180
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,200
它们不是芸豆。我还以为是果冻宝宝呢。
They're not kidney beans. I thought they were jelly babies.

我们对此有一些评论。利亚姆笑

182

说到按时把事情做好，

183
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,080
山姆给了自己更多的担心。

牛奶巧克力和血橙手指。

186
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,920
这是一种血橙泥，我把它浓缩了
It's a blood orange puree, I've reduced it down

187
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,600
所以它就固定了，保持它的形状，
so it's just set, like, just holds its shape,

188
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,560
这正是我想要的

189
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,440
我想我今天可能需要幸运的袜子，这是肯定的。
I think I might need the luck of the socks today, that's for sure.

只会一点点。只会一点点。

不得不说，我的家人一直很支持我。

我们是朋友吗?我想是的。
Are we friends? Yeah, I suppose.

我们已经习惯了在大质量中工作。

210
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,800
但准备宴会并不是所有团队都熟悉的任务。
But preparing a banquet isn't it a familiar task for all the teams.

这绝对是一个巨大的挑战，所以一切都必须完美。

00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,480
在这样一家小公司工作，西奥很难相信这一点
Working for such a small company has seen Theo struggle to believe that

215
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,800
他们可以与来自高端酒店和餐厅的团队竞争。
they could compete with teams from high-end hotels and restaurants.

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:56,240
对我来说，西奥一直都是赢家，但他自己并不知道。
Theo, for me, he always has been a winner but he doesn't know it.

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
他每周都给我打电话，告诉我，
Every week, he was calling me and telling me,

218
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,480
“我不确定，我不确定。”
"I'm not sure, I'm not sure."

219
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:03,440
最后，已经是决赛了，我真的很自豪。
And finally, it's already the final, so I'm really proud.

220
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,880
我真的为他感到骄傲。
I'm really proud of him.

221
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,960
西奥的未婚夫启发了他们的第二道甜点，
And Theo's fiance has inspired their second dessert,

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,840
改造gianduja慕斯，

223
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,360
芒果和佛手柑果汁
mango and bergamot compote

224
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,360
还有巧克力和榛子黑貂

225
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,880
戴在无名指上。
into a ring finger.

226
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,480
对于他的第二道甜点，Darryl冒着巨大的风险。
For his second dessert, Darryl is taking a huge risk.

227
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,160
我不能吃任何坚果，
I'm not allowed to eat any nuts,

228
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,280
所以我要做一个可爱的榛子焦糖。
so I'm going to make a lovely hazelnut caramel.

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,000
只是个寻求危险的人。
Just a danger seeker.

230
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,760
生活在边缘。
Life on the edge.

231
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,720
在达里尔成为厨师之前，危险从未远离。
Before Darryl became a chef, danger was never far away.

232
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,600
这是一个相当困难的青年。
It was quite a difficult youth.

233
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,440
直到11岁我妈妈去世的时候我都还好，不幸的是，
I was OK up to about 11 when my mum passed away and, unfortunately,

234
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:52,600
我16岁离开家，从那以后就开始走下坡路了。
I left home at 16 and it kind of went downhill from there.

235
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:56,560
和警察纠缠不清，极度黑暗，
In and out of trouble with the police, extremely dark time,

236
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,600
直到我遇到了我的妻子汉娜，后来成为厨师。
until I met my wife Hannah and then cheffing.

237
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,840
他不停地工作，然后用自己的方式冷静下来
He worked and worked and worked, then calmed down with his ways

238
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,280
搬到这里来感觉很好
and it was nice to move down here

239
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,600
远离那些废话。
and get away from all the nonsense.

240
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,720
我为他感到骄傲，队友们都认为他很棒。
Really proud of him and the boys think he's fantastic.

241
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Darryl的旅程在他的第二道甜点中得到了庆祝，
Darryl's journey is celebrated in his second dessert,

242
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,920
用…制成的旅行棒

243
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,600
巧克力甘纳许慕斯
chocolate ganache mousseline

244
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,280
淡盐榛子焦糖让我们

245
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,400
回到他进入总决赛之旅的起点。
right back to the start of his trip to the grand final.

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,240
这是我为了参加比赛所做的努力。
It's the bar that I did to get into this competition.

247
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:28,320
我把它从伯明翰带到伦敦，没有坏掉
I took it from Birmingham to London without them breaking

248
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
他们旅行得很好。
and they travelled really well.

249
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,760
巴拉特，你想快点尝一下吗?
Bharat, do you want to just taste this quick?

250
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,400
是的。快，快，快。
Yeah. Quick, quick, quick.

251
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,040
Salt-wise。
Salt-wise.

252
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,600
是的，很好。好吗?是的。
Yeah, it's good. Good? Yeah.

253
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,920
大厨们，你们还有一个小时。
Chefs, you have one hour left.

254
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,800
那是一个小时。他说了什么?一个小时，好吗?是的。
That's one hour. What did he say? One hour, OK? Yep.

255
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,520
一小时，Hideko。谢谢你！
One hour, Hideko. Thank you.

256
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,720
有多少?一个小时。有我们吗?哔哔声。
How many? An hour. Have we? BLEEP.

257
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,280
我可能需要帮手来做这些。确定。
I might need a hand just to build these. Sure.

258
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,960
需要凝固的甜点…
Desserts that need to set...

259
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,800
爆炸中有果冻吗?是的。
Jelly in the blast? Yeah.

260
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,040
. .必须尽快放到冰箱里。
..have to be in the freezer as soon as possible.

261
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:59,480
这是做手指用的，我把慕斯放进模具里。
This is for the finger, I'm piping the mousse into the mould.

262
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,040
现在的任何拖延都将意味着更少的时间
Any delay now will mean less time to glaze

263
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,400
在第一次评判前添加细节。
and add detail before the first judging.

264
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,960
这些是旅行酒吧。
These are the travel bars.

265
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,600
我需要把它们封起来，然后放进冰箱。
I need to seal these off and then put them in the freezer.

266
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
时间不等人。
Time waits for no man.

267
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,640
这里越来越热了。＃
# It's getting hot in here. #

268
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,560
但是西奥已经落后了。
But Theo is already falling behind.

269
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,680
我在做。好的。
I'm making them. OK.

270
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,080
还有很多事要做。
Still quite a lot of to do.

271
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,200
他的手指可能在冰箱里…
His fingers might be in the freezer...

272
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,640
. .但他甚至还没有开始他的冰淇淋幻想。
..but he's yet to even start his ice cream illusions.

273
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,680
下一个是芝士蛋糕。好的。
The cheesecake next, please. OK.

274
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,400
是的。
Yeah.

275
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,080
半小时，大厨们。你还有半个小时。
Half an hour, chefs. You've got half an hour left.

276
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,920
这是白巧克力加覆盆子的金发蛋糕。
This is a white chocolate and raspberry blondie.

277
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,560
最重要的是准确性，否则图层看起来就不对了。
It's all about accuracy, otherwise the layers won't look right.

278
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,080
它们是固定的，这是主要的。
They're set, that's the main thing.

279
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:50,520
只要切掉其中一个末端，因为它们真的很大。
Just cutting one of the ends off because they're really big.

280
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,920
每种甜点只有一个样品会被仔细审查
Just a single example of each dessert will be scrutinised

281
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,160
评委们…
by the judges...

282
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,480
这是焦糖巧克力和泡米。
It's a caramel chocolate with puffed rice.

283
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,400
它只是提供了另一种质感。
It just gives another texture.

284
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,080
. .这意味着细节比以往任何时候都重要。
..meaning detail is more important than ever.

285
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,240
我在给手指上光泽釉。
I'm doing the shiny glaze for the finger.

286
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,480
我要在中间放一些柚子豆腐
I'm going to put some of the yuzu curd just between there

287
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,040
每一层都得到了一些东西。继续前进。
so every sort of layer's getting something. Pushing on now.

288
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,400
我看到一个甜点了，另一个怎么样?
I can see one dessert there, how's the other one going?

289
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,960
它会。
It's going.

290
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,040
山姆!
Sam!

291
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:19,240
你不会从萨姆那里得到什么。它在走，但是在走……
You're not going to get a lot from Sam. It's going, but going...

292
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,480
. .正确?呃…
..correctly? Er...

293
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,320
10分钟后我们就知道了。
We'll see in about 10 minutes' time.

294
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,240
我要给酒吧装饰一下，
Going to do a little decoration for the bar,

295
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,000
刷上一些金色的闪光。
brush some gold shimmer on.

296
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,760
24-BHARAT黄金。
24-BHARAT gold.

297
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,360
大厨们，你们还有15分钟。
Chefs, you have 15 minutes left.

298
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,560
对，把这个加到演员名单上。
Right, add that to the cast.

299
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,200
所以我们明天还要做釉料。
So, we've still got glaze to make for tomorrow.

300
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,120
甜点就在上面。
The desserts are going to be up there.

301
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,240
我至少在努力完成一点装饰工作。
I'm trying to at least push to get a little bit of decoration done.

302
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,320
非常激烈。四个半小时过得太快了。
Very intense. Four and a half hours have just gone so fast.

303
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,040
正在煮的糖对我明天的生活有很大的影响，
The sugar being cooked makes a world of difference for me tomorrow,

304
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
否则我就会战斗一整天了。
otherwise I would've been fighting the whole day.

305
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,960
我希望我今天能多做些事情。
I wish I have more done today.

306
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,400
你觉得你能及时完成吗?我必须这么做。
You think you can get that done in time? I have to.

307
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,560
我没有时间。
I don't have time.

308
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,600
大厨们，你们有一分钟时间。
Chefs, you have one minute.

309
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,680
我的天啊。
My goodness.

310
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,720
盘子里。你抓住他们了。
Plate. You got 'em.

311
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,640
更多?
More?

312
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:20,760
厨师们，请离开你们的工作台。
Chefs, please step away from your workbenches.

313
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,160
你今天的时间到了。
Your time today is up.

314
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,960
这很艰难。
That was tough.

315
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,840
所以你明天要上，一定要上。
So you're going to be on it tomorrow, have to be on it.

316
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,160
明天会很艰难。是吗?
Tomorrow will be tough. Yeah?

317
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,320
每队四道甜点的前两道将进入明天的决赛
The first two of each team's four desserts for tomorrow's final

318
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,120
宴会现在由珍爱和伯努瓦来评判。
banquet will now be judged by Cherish and Benoit.

319
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,560
西奥和英子，请把你们的甜点端上来。
Theo and Hideko, please bring your desserts to the table.

320
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,760
老实说，它看起来就像一个小花盆，
It looks like a little flowerpot, to be honest with you,

321
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,720
而不是冰淇淋蛋筒，但我明白你的意思。
as opposed to an ice cream cone, but I see the idea.

322
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,920
圆锥体可以吃吗?
Is the cone edible?

323
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:07,320
它可以食用，但不是甜点的一部分。
It's edible but it's not part of the dessert.

324
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,240
外面是柑橘芝士蛋糕
Citrus cheesecake outside

325
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,880
还有藏红花慕斯和柑橘果盘。
and saffron mousse and a citrus compote.

326
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,400
我很喜欢慕斯，我觉得它很清淡。
I really like the mousse, I think, it's really light.

327
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:25,600
然而，我渴望更有质感的来刺激我的味觉。
However, I was craving for more textured to excite my palate.

328
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:29,160
因为这已经不是我想的那样了，
Because this is no longer what I thought it was,

329
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,040
然后这个就变软了。
then this becomes soft.

330
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,640
藏红花会污染周围的一切。
And the saffron contaminates everything around.

331
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,200
所有的味道都是一样的。
The whole lot tastes of one thing.

332
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:39,120
再提醒我一次，这应该是个手指吗?
And remind me again, this is supposed to be a finger?

333
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:44,720
做得很整齐。釉，做得很好。
It's very neatly done. The glaze, it was nicely finished.

334
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:49,160
这是巧克力和榛子，佛手柑和芒果的混合果汁
So this is a chocolate and hazelnut sable, bergamot and mango compote

335
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,480
然后是牛奶巧克力慕斯，上面有牛奶巧克力釉。
and then a milk chocolate mousse with a milk chocolate glaze.

336
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,440
哔哔声。对不起!
BLEEP great. Sorry!

337
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:05,280
我真的，真的，真的，真的，真的，真的，真的很喜欢。
I really, really, really, really, really, really, really love this.

338
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,280
芒果和佛手柑的味道，我非常喜欢。
Mango and bergamot, the flavour, I really loved.

339
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,360
吃的时候不会太甜。
When you eat it, it's not over-sweet.

340
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:15,560
就口感而言，这比你的芝士蛋糕更让我兴奋。
In terms of texture, this excites me more than your cheesecake.

341
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,120
这是一块不错的糕点。
It's a nice piece of pastry.

342
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,880
谢谢你！非常感谢。
Thank you. Thank you very much.

343
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,160
干得好，伙计们!
Well done, guys!

344
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,880
这是榛子味的高音棒。看起来很开胃。
It's a hazelnut treble bar. It looks very appetising.

345
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,280
它是光滑的。我喜欢你加了
It's sleek. I like the fact that you've added

346
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,000
部分喷涂的顶部
a partly sprayed top

347
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,760
底部是一层美味的釉。
and a gourmand glaze at the bottom.

348
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,440
这是一种淡巧克力，
It's a light chocolate panache,

349
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,320
榛子焦糖加一点盐，
a hazelnut caramel with a touch of salt,

350
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,480
配上焦糖泡米。
with caramelised puff rice.

351
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,600
你用的是我不喜欢的味道。
You are working here with flavour I don't like.

352
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,600
但我爱。
But I love.

353
00:16:58,640 --> 00:16:59,960
:哦!
ALL: Oh!

354
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,520
一小撮盐可以提升焦糖的味道。
That little pinch of salt is lifting the caramel flavour.

355
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,320
这是哇。
This is wow.

356
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,640
我真的很喜欢它，因为它有泡米。
I really like it because of the puffed rice.

357
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,240
我吃的时候有一种酥脆的感觉。
There is a crispy sensation that I'm eating.

358
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,520
巧克力的咸味能很好地平衡吗
Can taste the saltiness of the chocolate balanced very well

359
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,560
有慕斯和脆脆的口感。
with the mousse and the crunch.

360
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,040
好了，我们找到下一个了。
Okay, we've got the next one.

361
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,520
从视觉上看，它是一块切好的金发女郎。
Visually, it's a cut piece of blondie.

362
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
像这样切一些覆盆子。
Just sliced like this, some raspberries.

363
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,320
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

364
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:29,760
这已经做过太多次了，这是最后一次，伙计们。
It's been done too many times - this is the final, guys.

365
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,120
这是一种千面杂烩。
It's a take on a mille-feuille.

366
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,000
是白巧克力加覆盆子的金发蛋糕，
It's a white chocolate and raspberry blondie,

367
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,120
配覆盆子，白巧克力和柚子奶油。
with raspberries and white chocolate and yuzu cremeux.

368
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,560
说到味道，那一点柚子奶油，很酸。
In terms of flavour profile, that little yuzu cream, very acidic.

369
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,560
唯一漂亮的地方就是下面那个金发美女。
The only nice part here is your blondie at the bottom.

370
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,920
口感很好，很甜，很好吃。
It was beautiful texture, sweet and this was nice.

371
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:53,440
我对你的期望远不止这些。
I expect more than what you have displayed for us.

372
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,920
然而，这一块是我们真正喜欢吃的。
However, this one piece that we really enjoy eating.

373
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,720
我很喜欢。
I loved it.

374
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,520
做得很好。谢谢你！谢谢你！
Well done. Thank you. Thank you.

375
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,160
乍一看，它看起来不错。
From the first glance, it looks alright.

376
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:18,120
但当我仔细观察时，我希望它更干净。
But when I look closer, I expect it to be cleaner.

377
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,160
当我看到你把另一块切下来的时候，
And then when I saw you chop off the other piece over here,

378
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,760
这让我觉得它是不完整的。
it just let me feel that it was incomplete.

379
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,920
这是最后的润色，很匆忙。
It's the finishing touches, it's been rushed.

380
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,800
我们有佛罗伦萨底座，牛奶巧克力慕斯
We have a Florentine base, a milk chocolate mousse

381
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,200
中间是血橙果冻。
with a blood orange jelly in the middle.

382
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,320
底部的纹理很漂亮。脆脆的口感很美。
Lovely textures at the bottom. The crunchiness there is beautiful.

383
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,200
我不喜欢的部分是血橙。
The part I don't love is the blood orange.

384
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,200
它就是那种液体吗?我们预计它会有点流动，当……
Is it meant to be that liquid? We expected it to kind of be runny when...

385
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,960
但它没有跑，它飞走了。
Ah, but it's not running, it's flown away.

386
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,760
好的，还有一种甜点。
Okay, there is another dessert.

387
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,200
我要说的是，这是一种有点仓促的糕点。
Again, I would say this is a pastry which is a little bit rushed.

388
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,000
这是一个非常简单的设计，所以它需要非常圆滑
It's a very simple design, so for that it needs to be very sleek

389
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,720
这里的精确度对我来说还不够。
and the precision here is not quite there yet for me.

390
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:57,440
这位杏仁金融家被浸在了百香巧克力中。
The almond financier has been dipped in passion chocolate.

391
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,120
在里面，你有一个激情和芒果拼盘，然后在上面
Inside, you've got a passion and mango compote, and then on top

392
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,280
是马斯卡彭奶酪，用橘子和香草果冻调味。
is the mascarpone cream piped in a Mandarin and vanilla jelly.

393
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,200
当我单独吃它的时候，我喜欢它。
When I eat it as individual components, I like it.

394
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,760
但是当我把它作为一个整体吃的时候，它很干。
But when I eat it as a whole, it's quite dry.

395
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,880
你有七个不同的元素。我想你喝得太多了。
You've got seven different elements. I think you've got too many.

396
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,760
这是百香果的味道，很有味道。
I've got a passion fruit, dominant flavour.

397
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,320
但这很无趣。谢谢你们的努力，团队。
But it's uninteresting. Thanks for your effort, team.

398
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
谢谢你！谢谢你！明天又是新的一天。
Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow is another day.

399
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,080
是啊!在那之后。
Yeah! After that.

400
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,040
我们度过了一个艰难的早晨。
We had a tough morning.

401
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:36,680
我不知道是缺乏计划还是希望做得太多。
I don't know if it's lack of planning or hoping to do too much.

402
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,480
今天的评论不错，感觉很好。
Good comment today, feel really good.

403
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,040
4.5小时刚刚过去!
4.5 hours just gone!

404
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,960
所有的事情都要在明天完成，所有的事情。
Still everything has to be done tomorrow, everything.

405
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,160
奖杯现在已经触手可及了
The trophy is in reach of our hands now

406
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,240
但我们明天真的很忙。
but we've really got a push tomorrow.

407
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,240
今天是比赛的最后一天。
It's the last day of the competition.

408
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,760
几个小时后，其中一支队伍将加冕

409
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:01,600
《烘焙大赛:2018》的优胜者。
the winners of Bake Off: The Professionals 2018.

410
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,880
在这个时刻，说两支球队是平衡的，公平吗?
Is it fair to say that the teams are evenly balanced at this moment in time?

411
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,080
我不得不说，它非常非常接近。
I have to say that it is very, very close.

412
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,720
Darryl和Bharat，他们的高音棒很好吃。
Darryl and Bharat, their treble bar was delicious.

413
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,280
毫无疑问，这是目前为止最好的甜点。
Without a shadow of a doubt, the best dessert so far.

414
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,520
甜蜜艺术实验室的情侣们。
The sweethearts of Sweet Art Lab.

415
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,400
在半决赛中看到英子能为她做些什么之后
After seeing in the semi-final what Hideko can do for her

416
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,600
活电镀，我现在期待更多。
live plating, I am expecting even more now.

417
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,840
山姆和伊曼纽尔，他没有达到他想达到的目标。
Sam and Emmanuel, he did not achieve as much as he wanted to.

418
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,160
好像少了点什么。
There was something missing.

419
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,040
但他们总是会反弹，这些家伙，所以一切都是为了比赛。
But they always bounce back, those guys, so everything is to play for.

420
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,560
我想知道谁会赢得现金奖。
I wonder who's going to win that cash prize.

421
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,680
他们会很享受花这些钱。兄弟，没有现金奖励。
They can really enjoy spending that money. Bruv, there's no cash prize.

422
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,200
没有钱?!不。
There's no money?! No.

423
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,920
他们为什么要这么做?
Why are they doing it?

424
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,360
白痴。
Idiots.

425
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,840
我在开玩笑。
I'm joking.

426

这些队伍现在只有4.5小时的时间来完成任务
The teams now have just 4.5 hours to complete

希望它能落实到位。或者不会。
Hopefully it will fall into place. Or it won't.

今天是重要的一天。最后的机会……时间太少了。是啊!
It's a massive day. Last chance to... So little time. Yeah!

434
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,280
这是期末考试，一定很紧张!
It's the final - it has to be stressful!

435
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,200
名胜世界，今天是最后一天!

436
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,840
你好吗?
How are you doing?

437
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,520
我觉得我们有点落后了。
I think we're a little bit behind.

438
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,240
就因为我昨天没去铸这些。对着它。
Simply because I didn't get these casted yesterday. Up against it.

439

加一点香精和一些橘子胶。

Um... It's up to you. Over here, you never have a knife and fork, you go...

That's the whole point of having the buns is to hold it up, no?

00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,520
所以要选角和拉绳。
So there's casting and all the pulling to be done.

492
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,040
吹，然后是巧克力。
Blowing and then there's chocolate work.

493
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,720
你有香槟酒瓶，你有……哦，那是狮子吗?
So you've got the champagne bottle, you've got... Oh, is that a lion?

494
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,280
那是一头狮子。做得很好。是的,是的。是啊，两选一。
That is a lion. Well done. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that's two out of two.

495
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,240
第三个是什么?然后你就会，
What's the third one? And then you've got, like,

496
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,800
那些站在女王房子外面包厢里的人。
the people that stand in the boxes outside the Queen's house.

497
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,320
对，就是这个。它们叫什么?警卫。
Yeah, that's the one. What are they called? Guards.

498
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,720
我以为他们的名字很时髦呢。
I thought they had a posher name.

499
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,000
他们很可能会，我不确定。
They might well do, I'm not sure.

500
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,400
我对糖不是很有信心，所以…
I'm not really confident with sugar, so...

501
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,320
西奥的第二次尝试将会是一个浪漫的中心
Theo's second attempt at a romantic centrepiece will feature

502
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,400
心是用糖做的。
hearts made from poured sugar.

503
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,120
现在开始铸造。
Casting it now.

504
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:18,600
还有一颗巨大的钻石镶嵌在金铸糖上。
And the giant diamond set in a display of gold cast sugar.

505
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,400
我试着把管子做成一个心形。
I tried to make a heart-shape out of the pipe.

506
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
巴拉特在做巧克力圈。
Bharat is doing the chocolate ring.

507
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,280
陈列品将坐在糖陈列品的后面，
The showpiece will be sitting behind the sugar showpiece,

508
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:32,120
有球，有花。定型大约需要45分钟到1个小时。
with balls, flowers. It will take about 45 minutes to an hour to set.

509
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:36,080
大厨们，你们有一个小时的时间。你现在还剩下3.5小时。
Chefs, you've had an hour. You now have 3.5 hours left.

510
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:39,640
已经过去一个小时了。我知道。哔哔声。
That's an hour's gone already. I know. BLEEP.

511
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,360
这件事昨天就该做了。
This should have been done yesterday.

512
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,920
如果提供80种甜点和所有元素的壮观
If delivering 80 desserts and all the elements for a spectacular

513
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,880
《Showpiece》要求不够高……
showpiece wasn't demanding enough...

514
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,080
. .Hideko试图同时做到这两点。
..Hideko is attempting to do both at the same time.

515
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,280
她的最后一道甜点将伪装成她的展示品的一部分。
Her final dessert will be disguised as part of her showpiece.

516
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,920
她华丽的牛奶巧克力相框里会有巧克力慕斯，
Her ornate milk chocolate picture frame will contain chocolate mousse,

517
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,120
榛子黑貂饼干，跳跳糖和百香果
hazelnut sable biscuit, popping candy and a passionfruit

518
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,200
还有柚子盐焦糖。
and yuzu salted caramel.

519
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,360
在争夺冠军的最后一搏中，
In the final push for the title,

520
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,800
英子不是唯一一个愿意欺骗的人。
Hideko isn't the only one willing to deceive.

521
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,040
我把果冻和英吉利酱一起放进蛋糕里。
I've got the jelly with the anglaise to go inside the cake.

522
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,640
和主菜一模一样。
Exactly like an entremet.

523
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:32,760
伊曼纽尔做的层层野草莓果冻和英式奶油
Emmanuel's layers of wild strawberry jelly and creme anglaise will be

524
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,040
周围是法式蓝莓草莓青柠慕斯，
surrounded by a French Mara des Bois strawberry and lime mousse,

525
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:39,240
镶嵌成一个垫子的形状，上面放着皇冠上的珠宝，
set in the shape of a cushion to bear the crown jewels,

526
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,160
最后一道主菜陈列室甜点
for a final entremet showroom dessert

527
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,320
这将他们的主题结合在一起。
that brings their showpiece theme together.

528
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,920
它离心脏很近。我们有一个草莓奶油蛋糕，
It's quite close to heart. We have a strawberries and cream cake,

529
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,480
我年轻时在温布尔登当过球童。
and I was a ballboy at Wimbledon when I was younger.

530
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,360
还有，皇家坐垫，我爸爸在白金汉宫工作，
Also, the royal cushion, my dad works in Buckingham Palace,

531
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,880
这是另一个联系。
so another connection there.

532
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,680
而希尔顿公园巷和
While the banquets and themes for both Hilton Park Lane and

533
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:02,120
Sweet Art Lab开始联合起来，为Darryl和Bharat…
Sweet Art Lab are starting to come together, for Darryl and Bharat...

534
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,720
它是什么样的?还是有点软。
What's it like? Still a bit soft.

535
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,720
. .到达终点的旅程似乎越来越长了。
..The journey to their end party seems to be getting longer.

536
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,960
我不想搬家，那是因为……
I don't want to move that's because...

537
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,240
巴拉特的巧克力戒指还没有凝固，
Bharat's chocolate ring still hasn't set,

538
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,320
完成最后一道甜点也是他的工作。
and it is also his job to complete their final dessert.

539
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,600
我要把我的柠檬酥饼压平。
So I'm just stamping out my lemon shortbread.

540
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,880
这是芒果巴瓦鲁的底料。
Which is going to be the base for the mango bavarois.

541
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,720
巴拉特的每一块柠檬酥饼都要放在上面
On each of Bharat's lemon shortbreads will sit

542
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,280
白巧克力上釉的芒果巴瓦鲁球，
white chocolate glazed spheres of mango bavarois,

543
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,280
里面有西番莲果冻
filled with a passionfruit jelly

544
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,840
还有芒果和西番莲果盘。
and a mango and passionfruit compote.

545
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:31,760
我想这个会有更多的纹理
I think this will have a few more textures

546
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:34,120
以及他们可能喜欢的味道。
and flavours that they might enjoy.

547
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,720
球，碗，球。
It's balls, bowls, balls.

548
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,440
大厨们，你们的最终挑战已经进行了一半!
Chefs, you are halfway through your final challenge!

549
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,000
哎呦。对不起,男人。
Whoops. Sorry, man.

550
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,920
有很多很多事情要做。没时间了。这里有很多事情要做。
A lot, a lot to do. Running out of time. Plenty, plenty to do here.

551
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,000
我得停止巧克力装饰了
I'm going to have to stop chocolate decoration to get on with

552
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,160
蛋糕马上就做好了。
cake finishing in a minute.

553
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,920
我只是在选大本钟和埃菲尔铁塔
I'm just casting the Big Ben and the Eiffel Tower

554
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,800
这样他们就能及时冷却下来，以便使用。
so they can get cooling down in time to be able to use.

555
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:59,080
感觉名单越来越长了。
Feels like the list is getting longer.

556
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:02,280
我在做一些气球，一些丝带。
I'm doing some balloons, some ribbons.

557
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,360
希望是一只戴着帽子飞来的天鹅
Hopefully a swan that will come round with a hat

558
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,960
还有一点三叶草。
and a little shamrock.

559
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,720
Darryl给自己设定了一个挑战，使用五种不同的
Darryl set himself the challenge of using five different

560
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,520
不同种类的糖来制造30多种不同的元素。
types of sugar to create over 30 separate elements.

561
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,840
还是没定。是吗?还是没定。
Still not set. Eh? Still not set.

562
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,200
但如此大量的熔融物放出的热量
But the heat given off by such a large quantity of molten

563
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,840
糖可能对巴拉特的巧克力没有帮助。
sugar may not be helping Bharat's chocolate.

564
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,640
你看，它只是在加热房间。这是我们不想要的。
It's just heating up the room, you see. Which we don't want.

565
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,560
可能把我们推迟了半小时。
Pushed us back about half an hour, probably.

566
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,800
我是说，一分钟是很长的时间。
I mean, an minute's a long time.

567
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,120
他们并不是唯一一支开始失去宝贵时间的球队。
And they're not the only team beginning to lose precious minutes.

568
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,200
西奥的浪漫中心装饰的组成部分有
The components for Theo's romantic centrepiece have

569
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,720
冷却时开裂。
cracked during cooling.

570
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,520
我真的不喜欢吃糖。
Sugar is really not my thing.

571
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,920
在这次比赛中做了一次，两次。
Done once, twice in this competition.

572
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,280
现在没有时间重新塑造他们了。
And now there is no time to recast them.

573
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,160
应该做心脏手术但我不确定我们现在是否要做心脏手术。
Supposed to do a heart but I'm not sure we're going to do a heart now.

574
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,600
灾难。
Disaster.

575
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,600
还剩90分钟，我们将赢得职业烘焙大赛。
90 minutes left to win Bake Off - The Professionals.

576
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:58,480
你还好吗?是的。看起来不应该是这样的。
You OK? Yeah. Doesn't look how it should be.

577
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,480
当西奥被迫简化他的浪漫糖果展示时……
While Theo has been forced to simplify his romantic sugar showpiece...

578
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,400
是的，我很生气。
I'm annoyed, yes.

579
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,400
. .对山姆来说，简单不是他的菜单。
..for Sam, simplicity is not on the menu.

580
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,120
我正在尝试做我做过的最复杂的滴注。
I'm attempting to do one the most complicated drips I've ever done.

581
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,840
在比赛中第一次，
For the first time in the competition,

582
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,800
他正试图吹细糖管并把它们折起来
he is attempting to blow thin sugar tubes and fold them

583
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,320
一起形成三维的缎带。
together to form three-dimensional ribbons.

584
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,880
我觉得我们每一轮都要加倍努力。
I think we're trying to go the extra mile with every round.

585
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,440
到现在为止，我们已经走了好几英里了。
By now, we've done quite a few miles.

586
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,520
但是Darryl和Bharat的野心……好带。
But Darryl and Bharat's ambitions... Good ribbon.

587
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,840
. .将他们有史以来最大的制糖量结合起来哦,是的!
..to combine their largest-ever volume of sugar work... Oh, yes!

588
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:34,680
. .带着一个巨大的巧克力陈列品……你有粉丝吗?
..with a huge chocolate showpiece... Do you have any fans?

589
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,600
. .似乎没有任何进展
..doesn't appear to be getting any closer

590
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,040
他们的时间不多了。
and they're running out of time.

591
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,880
球队的朋友和家人已经开始陆续抵达洛德
The team's friends and families have began arriving at Lord

592
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,760
还有盖奇夫人的派对，还有一些熟悉的面孔。
and Lady Gage's party, along with a few familiar faces.

593
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,920
回来的感觉真好。
It feels really great to be back.

594
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,160
是啊，感觉很好
Yeah, it feels really good,

595
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,000
因为你没有压力什么的。
cos you're not under pressure or nothing.

596
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,600
我现在觉得有点暴露了
I feel a little exposed now,

597
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,360
人们可以看到我的时尚品味有多差!
and people can see how bad my fashion sense is!

598
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,960
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

599
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,160
对山姆来说，这太艰难了。他从不在家。
For Sam, it's been so hard for him. He's never at home.

600
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,520
他总是在练习。
He's always practising.

601
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:04,040
我们希望能再多见到他一点，
We'd love to see him a bit more than we have done,

602
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,120
但我们为他感到无比骄傲。
but we're amazingly proud of him.

603
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,560
西奥非常喜欢。
Theo is so into it.

604
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:11,520
就像，他奉献了，他完全奉献了自己。
Like, he gave, he gave himself, like, totally.

605
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,440
他只是在练习。
He's just practising and everything.

606
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,640
当他回到家，他是如此的累。他太累了。
When he comes home, he's so tired. He's so, so tired.

607
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
他只想睡觉。
He just wants to go to sleep.

608
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,000
是的，他说，“我想睡觉。我想睡觉!
Yes, he says, "I want to go to sleep. I want to sleep!

609
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,240
我觉得我爸很有可能赢。
I think my dad's got a good chance of winning.

610
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,160
厨师们，你们还有一个小时来完成你们的宴会。
Chefs, you have one hour left to complete your banquets.

611
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,120
你还好吗，劳伦?还有几件事要做。
Do you feel all right, Lauren? Er, still a few things to do.

612
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,760
不过你的时间不多了。你的……怎么样?
Your time's ticking, though. What about your...?

613
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
好的，我现在就查一下。
Yeah, I'll check it now.

614
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,640
在这最后的时刻，
In this final hour,

615
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:39,320
这些团队必须建造他们设计过的最大的展示品…
the teams must construct the largest showpieces they've ever designed...

616
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,920
彩带做好了。管子完成了。
The ribbons are done. The tubes are done.

617
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,560
一切都是模式化的。气球是下一个。
Everything's been moulded. The balloons is the next one.

618
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:50,320
. .为240个甜点做最后的修饰。
..and put the finishing touches to 240 deserts.

619
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,920
这就够了。
This is enough.

620
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,960
这是芒果巴瓦罗。
This is the mango bavarois.

621
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,920
Hideko吗?是吗?我要的洋葱是你做的吗?对不起,没有。
Hideko? Yes? Did you make the onions that I asked for? Sorry, no.

622
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,120
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

623
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,320
我只是想给它们多一点颜色。
I just wanted to give them a bit more colour.

624
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,640
我去过英国。现在我想做一个法国气球。
I've done England. Now I want to do a France balloon.

625
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,080
希望这能让我们从伯努瓦那里得到加分。
Hopefully, this will get us some bonus points from Benoit.

626
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,240
我现在还得把我的花组装在这里。
I've got to still assemble my flowers on here now.

627
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,960
我在做一只小鸟。
I'm making a wee bird.

628
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:21,760
那是埃菲尔铁塔。
That's the Eiffel Tower.

629
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,520
这是大本钟。
This is the Big Ben.

630
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,080
这是我最不喜欢的部分。公平地说，这就像兽医一样。
This is the bit I dislike most. It is like being a vet, to be fair.

631
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,720
如果我造得太晚，它就不会凝固。
If I build too late, it's not going to set.

632
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:41,520
如果我一块一块慢慢地组装，就像我做花一样，
If I build piece by piece slowly, as I'm making the flowers,

633
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,360
因为匆忙建造总是有风险的。
cos rushing a build is always a risk.

634
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,440
一旦我完成了所有这些，我就可以继续建造了。
Once I've pulled all of these, I can get on with building.

635
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,840
不过我需要两个。
I need two of these, though.

636
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,360
我正忙着把香槟酒灌完。
I'm working on the finish of the champagne bottle.

637
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,400
好吧，希望我们不用喝这个，
Well, hopefully, we won't be drinking from this one,

638
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,760
但我们会再喝一杯的!
but we'll be drinking another one!

639
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:04,080
不管发生什么，我都要喝酒!我们还剩多久?
Whatever happens, I'll be drinking! How long have we got left?

640
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,640
大厨们，最后的挑战只剩下半个小时了!
Chefs, that's just half an hour left on your final challenge!

641
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,760
30分钟。我们现在没法用这个了。
30 minutes. No way we can use this now.

642
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,960
没有时间。
No time.

643
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,000
巴拉特已经没有时间完成他的巧克力中心了。
Bharat has run out of time to complete his chocolate centrepiece.

644
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,280
他们最后一次宴会的成功与否取决于达里尔的制糖工作。
The success of their final banquet now rests on Darryl's sugar work.

645
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
最近怎么样?
How's it going?

646
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,640
你必须在不破坏石膏本身的情况下这样做，
You have to do this without breaking the actual cast itself,

647
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,200
因为那将是一场灾难。
cos that would be a calamity.

648
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,760
一场灾难!我喜欢这个词。
A calamity! I like that word.

649
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:31,640
糖，代表冰块。
The sugar, representing the ice cubes.

650
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,520
它必须保持平衡。
It's got to balance.

651
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,200
15分钟。啊!
15 minutes. Ah!

652
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,080
口干!
Dry mouth!

653
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,520
法国完蛋了。
Here goes France.

654
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,440
我无能为力，只能再试一次。
Nothing I can do about it, except try and do another one.

655
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,440
如果这个气球保持原样，它至少比第一个要好。
If this balloon stays like it is, it was better than the first one, anyway.

656
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,360
这让我很紧张。整件事让我很紧张。
It's making me nervous. The whole thing's make me nervous.

657
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
这是移动。
That's moving.

658
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,520
这是移动。
It's moving.

659
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,440
你能不能别那么用力敲桌子?
BANGING Can you please not bang that table so hard?

660
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,800
毫米吗?你能不能别再敲桌子了?
Mm? Can you stop banging the table?

661
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,600
对不起。留下来。
Sorry. Stay.

662
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,000
爆炸
BANG

663
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,640
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

664
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,080
他叹了口气
HE SIGHS

665
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:11,720
继续，继续。
Carry on, carry on.

666
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,480
模糊
INDISTINCT

667
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,680
就是这样。
That's that.

668
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:24,880
哦,不!达瑞尔和巴拉特的好戏刚刚落下。
Oh, no! Darryl and Bharat's showpiece has just dropped.

669
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:29,120
不管你有多想赢，这都很残酷。
However much you want to win this, it's gutting.

670
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:32,280
达雷尔，发生什么事了?
Darrell, what just happened?

671
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,000
只是还没来得及定型。
It's just not had the time to set.

672
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,920
但你知道吗?你们还在继续做这些事，
But do you know what, though? You guys are still continuing with these lot,

673
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:39,880
我觉得这是最主要的。继续。
and I feel like that's the main thing. Keep going.

674
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:42,160
别担心。是的。
Don't worry about it. Yep.

675
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,480
发出哔哔声
BLEEP

676
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,520
大厨们，你们还有五分钟。
Chefs, you have five minutes left now.

677
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,280
这个和这个，它们就像钻石。
This and this, they're like diamonds.

678
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,760
我想在上面放一些叶子。
I want to get some leaves on there.

679
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,440
这个展示品真的需要一点绿色。
The showpiece really needs a little bit of green.

680
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:01,000
脚下真的很脆。这不是很好的糖。
It's really crunchy underfoot. It's not very nice sugar.

681
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
她喘着气
SHE GASPS

682
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,520
她吹
SHE BLOWS

683
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,120
哇!我把它剪掉了。
Wow! I cut it off.

684
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,920
这之后我能接受心理咨询吗?我想我们需要它。
Can I have counselling after this? I think we're going to need it.

685
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,280
你还有一分钟。
You have one minute left.

686
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,680
不,山姆。忘了这个吧。好吧。我认为它增加了很多。
No, Sam. Forget this one. All right. I think it adds to it a lot.

687
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,160
队员们，该你们上场了。
Teams, that's your time up.

688
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,720
祝贺你,每一个人。
Congratulations, everyone.

689
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:39,320
你已经完成了最后的挑战。
You've completed your final challenge.

690
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,440
做得很好。对不起，伙计。
Well done. I'm sorry, man.

691
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,440
哦，好吧，你知道…没有足够的时间。
Oh, well, you know... Not enough time.

692
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,800
对不起，伙计。
I'm sorry, mate.

693
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,480
# Una furtiva lagrima…＃
# Una furtiva lagrima... #

694
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,040
三场80人的盛宴
Three showpiece banquets for 80 people

695
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,360
在短短9个小时内。
in just nine hours.

696
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,440
你看到什么了吗?不，我没看到。
Did you see what...? No, I didn't see it.

697
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:15,600
只是听到了声音，让我想起了我们的房子倒塌的时候。嗯嗯。
Just heard the noise, it reminded me of when ours fell down. Mm-hm.

698
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,560
我相信它也很美。哦，是的，毫无疑问。
I'm sure it was beautiful, as well. Oh, yeah, no doubt about it.

699
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:21,680
我知道他要去…他飞得很高。
I know he was going...he was going very high.

700
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,600
我要搬回孟加拉国。
I'm moving back to Bangladesh.

701
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,360
现在将由珍爱和伯努瓦来评判每队的最后一场比赛
Cherish and Benoit will now judge each team's final showpieces

702
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,560
品尝剩下的两种甜点。
and taste their remaining two desserts.

703
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,200
你所有优雅的结构，所有的努力，
You rested all your elegant structure, all that effort,

704
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,200
所有的工作都很漂亮，很优雅，
all that work, it was beautiful, it was elegant,

705
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,960
在最底部涂一点胶，不要比这个大。
on a little glueing, no bigger than this, at the very base.

706
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,720
我们可以看到它断裂的地方。
We can see where it broke.

707
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,920
你需要确保你知道你的压力点在哪里。
You need to make sure you understand where your pressure points are.

708
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,800
所以这很不幸。
So it's unfortunate.

709
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,160
你还好吗?
Are you all right?

710
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,240
你还好吗?你还好吗?是的。她抽噎
You OK? You OK? Yeah. SHE SNIFFLES

711
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,680
我只是为他们感到难过。
I just feel so sad for them.

712
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,160
对不起。
Sorry.

713
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,440
他呼出
HE EXHALES

714
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:22,120
你没事吧?是的。是的。好吗?
You all right? Yeah. Yeah. Bon?

715
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,800
这不仅仅是为了展示。现在，是关于甜点的。
It's not just about the showpiece. Now, it's about the dessert.

716
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,640
这是一个中式小蛋糕。
It's a Mandarin petit gateau.

717
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,880
它有一个橘子凝胶，一个橙色海绵
It has a Mandarin gel, an orange sponge

718
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:35,040
还有一块巧克力色的黑貂饼干，上面裹着香橙慕斯。
and a chocolate Sable biscuit, surrounded by scented orange mousse.

719
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,680
就设计而言，
Well, in terms of the design,

720
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,920
釉面有点薄。
the glaze was a little bit on the thin side.

721
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,440
很多这样的甜点
Quite a few of those desserts

722
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,280
釉还没完全涂好。是的。
haven't got the glaze all the way. Yeah.

723
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,240
就像巧克力配橘子一样。
Quite like the chocolate profile with the orange.

724
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,400
他们很般配。
They marry together very well.

725
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,280
黑貂太厚，又不够短，
The Sable is far too thick, and not short enough,

726
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:58,480
这使得它很难切割。
which makes it very difficult to cut.

727
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:02,160
这是芒果巴瓦罗加百香果果冻和新鲜芒果
It's a mango bavarois with a passion fruit jelly and fresh mango

728
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,120
还有百香果，最后是柠檬酥饼。
and passion fruit, finished with a lemon shortbread at the bottom.

729
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,080
从视觉上看，它很简单，但釉面很好。
Visually, it's pretty simple, but nicely glazed.

730
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,720
有时候，当它很简单的时候，它看起来真的很优雅。
Sometimes, when it is simple, it looks really elegant.

731
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,800
外观设计简单，内部设计简单。
Simple design on the outside, simple design on the inside.

732
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,560
但味道干净。摩丝的质地很漂亮。
But clean flavour. The mousse has a beautiful texture.

733
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,040
然后有了果盘，
And then with the compote,

734
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,760
酸度很快就会加入，它们之间的平衡非常好。
the acidity just kicks in straight away and they balance very nicely.

735
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,440
你做的每件事都很努力。
Very good effort in everything that you have done.

736
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,760
好吧，伙计们，这太激动人心了!它有。非常感谢。
Well, guys, it's been emotional! It has. Thank you very much.

737
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,720
两人:是的，谢谢。非常感谢。谢谢你！欢呼。
BOTH: Yes, thank you. Thanks very much. Thank you. Cheers.

738
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,560
开始和结束时都哭了。
Cried at the start and at the end.

739
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,240
他们笑了
THEY LAUGH

740
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:09,440
这看起来很疯狂!疯了。
This looks mad! Insane.

741
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:11,080
哇。
Wow.

742
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:13,280
你利用了每一秒。
You made use of every second.

743
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,360
看着你们俩工作真是太开心了。
It was such a joy to watch both of you work.

744
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,520
我真的很喜欢水晶球作为你的基础。
And I really like the crystal ball as your base.

745
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:23,440
真的很喜欢小狮子。它让我想起了特拉法加广场。
Really liked the little lion. It reminds me of Trafalgar Square.

746
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:26,560
它们都很好地结合在一起。
It all binds together really nicely.

747
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,080
我真的很喜欢这个配色方案。这是诚挚的协约。
I really like the colour scheme. It is the entente cordial.

748
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,480
吹糖丝带的小技巧
The little technique of the blown sugar ribbon

749
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,200
不是你经常看到的。
is not something you see often.

750
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,960
技术上很有挑战性。
Very technically challenging to do.

751
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,680
你能认出那些让你的故事生动起来的符号。
And you can recognise the symbols which bring your story to life.

752
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,560
但这不是甜点。
But it isn't the dessert.

753
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,360
我们想尝尝覆盆子和开心果球。
We would like to taste the raspberry and pistachio sphere.

754
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,760
你会看到一个红色的饼干层覆盖在开心果奶油上。
You will see a red biscuit cuillere to cover the pistachio buttercream.

755
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,480
里面是柑橘蛋白酥皮。
Inside, you've got citrus meringue.

756
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,720
最后，你会发现一些覆盆子酱。
To finish with, you will find some raspberry confit.

757
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,120
画龙点睛，
The finishing touch,

758
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,480
我想让它有更多的技巧和高完成度。
I'd like it to have a little bit more finesse and high finish.

759
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:08,600
我个人非常喜欢开心果和覆盆子。
Personally, I really like pistachio and raspberry.

760
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:13,680
我很喜欢你在蛋白派中加入皮屑。
I really like when you add in the zest into your meringue.

761
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,280
我尝了尝开心果。
I taste the pistachio.

762
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,360
我觉得奶油其实很清淡。
I think the buttercream is actually quite light.

763
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,800
但它仍然是奶油，所以这意味着有很多黄油。
But it's still a buttercream, so that means a lot of butter.

764
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:23,600
当你把它们一起吃的时候，你会有一种浓郁的感觉
When you eat it all together, you've got a sensation of richness

765
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,480
糖和脂肪。
in sugar and in fat.

766
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:28,760
这是一种老式的甜点。
So it's a little bit of an old-fashioned kind of dessert.

767
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,920
我很高兴你决定不拘泥于一种风格，
I like the fact that you've decided not to stick to one style,

768
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:38,160
所以在这种情况下，你有更多的分享甜点。
so you have more of a sharing dessert on this occasion.

769
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,280
草莓酸橙慕斯，
So you've got strawberry and lime mousse,

770
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,520
草莓果冻配新鲜草莓，
strawberry jelly with fresh strawberries,

771
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:46,480
香草奶油蛋糕，香草海绵蛋糕，底部是小蛋糕。
vanilla anglaise, vanilla sponge and the bottom is a feuilletine.

772
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:49,600
它很优雅。这层很均匀。
It's quite elegant. The layer is quite even.

773
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
我喜欢它的口感。这是可爱的海绵蛋糕

774
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,600
下面是脆脆的布丁。

775
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,680
我喜欢慕斯的口感，口感很柔滑
I like the mousse texture, quite creamy on my palate

776
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,240
而且对我来说很干净。
and it's quite clean for me.

777
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,600
至于果冻，它会完全融化，
And then, as for the jelly, it just melts completely,

778
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,360
我还能品尝到新鲜的草莓味。
and I can still taste the fresh strawberry.

779
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
它真的很好吃。两人:谢谢。

那里有很多乐趣。
A lot of fun is there.

785
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:48,040
我们总是被你的理念所折服。
We are always blown away with your concept.

786
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,920
那是个奢华的宴会吗?
Is that a lavish banquet?

787
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,880
我不太确定。
I'm not too sure.

788
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,800
糖链有点过于简单了。
And the sugar strand is a little bit on the simplistic side.

789
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,240
你能端上你的甜点吗?是的。
Will you be able to serve your dessert? Yes.

790
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,280
你喜欢奶酪吗?这是要加到汉堡里的……

793
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:12,880
汉堡外的面包是由百香果巧克力慕斯制成的
Outside the burger bun is made up of passion fruit chocolate mousse

794
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:16,080
还有夏威夷坚果巧克力布朗尼。

奶酪是白巧克力甘纳许。

我的大脑让我喜欢它，因为它太有趣了。
My mind's asking me to like it, because it's so fun.

802

我真的很喜欢巧克力蛋糕
I really like the brownie with

803
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,200
里面的澳洲坚果的嘎吱声。
the crunch of the macadamia that is inside.

804
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,760
我喜欢中间的布朗尼，
The brownie in the middle I like,

805
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,320
但我觉得对我来说，风格重于内容。
but I think it's style over substance for me.

806
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,760
有太多的事情要做，你只剩下一个……
There's too many things going on and you're left with a...

807
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,520
. .奇怪的味道。
..weird flavour.

808
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,920
芯片……
The chips...

809
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,240
. .没关系!

笑声
LAUGHTER

811
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,600
这是一种小酥饼，加了浓郁的覆盆子番茄酱。
It's a little shortbread with a quite intense raspberry ketchup.

812
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,760
这是我最喜欢的部分。
This is the part I could enjoy.

813
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
下一个。
Next one.

814
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,040
我很高兴你做出了这样的决定
I really enjoy the fact that you've decided that

815
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,840
你的一份甜点会是展示品的一部分。
one of your desserts would be part of the showpiece.

816
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,320
好主意。
Great idea.

817
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,400
这是我们第一次可以吃相框。

我喜欢这个主意。

00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,720
我很喜欢焦糖的味道。
I quite like the caramel taste.

820
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:32,600
然而，我认为它已经与大妥协
However, I think it has been compromised with the big

821
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,560
我吃过的大块巧克力，它超越了这种感觉
chunk of chocolate that I've eaten, and it overtakes the sensation

822
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,680
我以为我在吃酥饼
that I'm thinking I'm eating a shortbread.

823
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,960
酥饼很好吃，百香果焦糖也很棒
The shortbread is beautiful, the passion fruit caramel is great

824
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,040
再加上牛奶巧克力，
and the combination with the milk chocolate,

825
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:45,720
我可以玩一整天。
I could have this all day.

他们不喜欢别人。
they didn't like some other.

834
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:11,120
是的，那是不一样的。
Yes, that was different.

835
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,120
尤其是珍爱，用她的方式表达她的情感。
Especially Cherish showing her emotions the way she did.

836
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,600
当中心装饰物升起时，它看起来确实不错
When the centrepiece went up, it did look good

837
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
我为此感到非常自豪。
and I was quite proud of it.

838
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,920
是的。情感的全面。
Yeah. Emotional all-round.

我想我们都对结果感到焦虑和紧张。
I think we're both anxious and nervous about the result.

这将是非常不同的。
It's going to be very different.

841
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:27,280
通常我们会在厨房等待结果。
Normally we're waiting for result in the kitchen.

842
