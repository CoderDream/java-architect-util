00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:18,433
It feels really moist --
moist and absolutely delicious.

00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,300
Okay.

521
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,800
My hand is really bothering me,

522
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,867
so it's pretty hard
to do this piping.

523
00:20:25,867 --> 00:20:27,500
Oh, it's crumbling.

00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:32,300
So, I came in strong, confident,
and when this burnt hand came,

525
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,233
everything just went
into the drain.

526
00:20:36,233 --> 00:20:38,167
I'm trying to piece it together.

527
00:20:38,167 --> 00:20:40,000

Oh, jeez.

529
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:42,700
Yet I don't have enough room
for the "X,"

530
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,400
so I just go with it.

but I know it's gonna taste

I'm going to decorate
my cookie cake

566
00:22:03,533 --> 00:22:06,967
by adding a lot of sprinkles,
like a birthday cake,

567

just because birthday cakes
are fun and colorful.

568
00:22:10,733 --> 00:22:14,767
For the twist, I melt down some
light pink coating chocolates

and write my name.

The reason that I wanted
to use coating chocolate

571

because I knew it dries really
fast and coating chocolate

572
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,067
will hold its shape.

[ Sighs ] It's a mess.

and the last layer
of buttercream

600
00:23:36,467 --> 00:23:39,100
and then I pipe my name
with the pink chocolate,

'cause I love pink.

and my buttercream's done,

so then I start
to frost my cakes,

and I feel like
I'm missing something,

a little bit plain,

crystallized ginger and raisins

Decorating my cookie cake, I put
a layer of vanilla frosting

and then I put a layer
of chocolate frosting.

of smoked peanuts on it.

It's kinda beautiful.

693
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:03,233
Yeah, it looks like
it's a little...

694
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:05,067
-[ Makes squeaking sound]
-Squashed.

695
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:06,333
Yeah, it's like
somebody sat on it.

696
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,567
What happened?
It fell apart.

697
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:09,467
Gotcha.

698
00:27:09,467 --> 00:27:10,833
And then I tried to like
piece it all back

699
00:27:10,833 --> 00:27:14,067
together with the buttercream,
but you know.

700
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,567
And you know what?

701
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:16,933
Can I just say thank you
for not making excuses.

702
00:27:16,933 --> 00:27:18,467
Thank you for just
telling us the truth.

703
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:20,500
-I love when kids are honest.
-I wouldn't have been.

704
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,500
[ Laughter ]
I love it.

705
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:24,500
Cut it.
I want to taste it.

706
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,533
Okay, okay, okay.

707
00:27:25,533 --> 00:27:27,967
**

708
00:27:27,967 --> 00:27:29,067
Oh, yeah.

709
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,700
-There you go.
-Mmm.

710
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,900
-I like when chocolate drips."
-[ Laughs ] Me too.

711
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:37,833
-Boy, do I love this frosting.
-Oh, thank you.

712
00:27:37,833 --> 00:27:38,900
It's really tasty.

713
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:40,667
It's not overly sweet.

714
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:44,133
It's spongy like cake,
but it's crumbly like a cookie.
Yeah.

715
00:27:44,133 --> 00:27:45,067
You know, it's really
interesting,

716
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:46,367
and it's really good.

717
00:27:46,367 --> 00:27:48,533
-Thank you.
-DUFF: See you later.

718
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:50,333
All right, Luke.
Come on in.

719
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:52,067
-What's up, dude?
-Hi.

720
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:53,067
Tell us what you made for us.

721
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:54,600
Today I've made for you

722
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,433
a chocolate chip cookie cake
with Neapolitan frosting.

723
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,433
All right.
Well, this is gorgeous.

724
00:28:00,433 --> 00:28:02,533
-Thank you.
-So, Chef,

725
00:28:02,533 --> 00:28:05,167
tell me about what
happened right here.

726
00:28:05,167 --> 00:28:07,633
Hoped we wouldn't notice?

727
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:10,933
I was taking it out of the pan
and just a little bit fell off.

728
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:12,367
-Oh, gotcha.
-Did you eat it?

729
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:17,367
[ Laughs ]
Maybe instead of eating it...

730
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:18,633
I should put it back.

731
00:28:18,633 --> 00:28:20,133
Exactly. [ Laughs ]

732
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,067
It looked good.
I was hungry.

733
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:25,267
[ Laughter ]

734
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:26,633
Wow.
Wow.

735
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,433
Look at all those
chocolate chips in there.

736
00:28:28,433 --> 00:28:30,200
Nothing is more disappointing
when you think oh,

737
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,400
chocolate chip cookie

738
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,333
and you bite into it
and there's like three.

739
00:28:32,333 --> 00:28:33,967
-Yeah.
-Come on.

740
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,400
I like a lot
of chocolate chips.

741
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,667
Me, too.

742
00:28:36,667 --> 00:28:38,633
Oh, I love that vanilla
frosting and the strawberry.

743
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:40,133
Not too sweet.

744
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:43,667
Okay, here's
what's awesome -- you.

745
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:47,300
Because as a cookie cake,
with a cookie and a cake

746
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,467
and you stuck 'em together,
it's like you achieved

747
00:28:49,467 --> 00:28:51,933
I think the perfect texture
for what this is.

748
00:28:51,933 --> 00:28:53,633
-Thank you.
-But my problem

749
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,433
is I just wish the cookies
were half the size,

750
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,767
because it's so thick.
-Delicious cake.

751
00:28:58,767 --> 00:29:01,533
Thank you. Thank you.

752
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,900
-Aditya, come on in.
-Hi.

753
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,167
Tell us what's
in your cake.

754
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:09,733
So, it's a oatmeal raisin
cookie cake

755
00:29:09,733 --> 00:29:12,533
and I put some like cinnamon,
nutmeg, and all that.

756
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:14,600
That is one
killer cookie cake.

757
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,567
You know what?

758
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:17,067
I love how big it is.
Yeah.

759
00:29:17,067 --> 00:29:18,767
You know, it's like...
It's a real cake.

760
00:29:18,767 --> 00:29:20,200
And you didn't use a mold.

761
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,367
I mean, these are
free-form-baked, huge cookies.

762
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:24,600
Yeah.
Oh, it cuts good.

763
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,367
Oh, boy.

764
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:27,167
-Wow, look at that.
-Wow.

765
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:32,200
Oh, and I put candied ginger
in the middle and raisins.

766
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,867
What? You were just gonna
leave that out?

767
00:29:34,867 --> 00:29:39,333
Not tell us?

768
00:29:39,333 --> 00:29:42,800
I love a spicy cookie,
and when I mean spicy,

769
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,267
I mean all those great,

770
00:29:44,267 --> 00:29:45,500
warm spices like
your cinnamon, your nutmeg.

771
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,100
-Jalapeños.
-[ Laughs ] No. No.

772
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,900
And I get the heat
from the ginger,

773
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,267
which is really, really nice.

774
00:29:51,267 --> 00:29:53,600
The flavors in here
are perfection.

775
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:56,100
-Yeah. Thank you.
-Thank you.

776
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,367
Hey, Alex.
How's it going, buddy?

777
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,533
Good.
How's it going with you?

778
00:29:59,533 --> 00:30:00,700
I'm pretty good.

779
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,900
So, let's see it.
Let's see the injury. Yeah.

780
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,267
-Now you're a real chef.
-Yeah.

781
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,400
You're not a chef
without scars.

782
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,567
-[ Laughs ]
-Thattaboy.

783
00:30:06,567 --> 00:30:07,467
There you go.

784
00:30:07,467 --> 00:30:09,033
So, tell us about
your cookie cake.

785
00:30:09,033 --> 00:30:11,433
Okay, so I made
a lemon sugar cookie cake

786
00:30:11,433 --> 00:30:14,300
with a raspberry frosting
and hope you enjoy.

787
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,033
It looks like you ran out
of room

788
00:30:16,033 --> 00:30:17,167
when you were writing your name.

789
00:30:17,167 --> 00:30:19,100
Yeah, I did.

790
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,167
So, the X is kind of over here

791
00:30:21,167 --> 00:30:22,967
and then you covered it up
with a strawberry.

792
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:24,767
-Yeah.
-I don't know that I love

793
00:30:24,767 --> 00:30:27,300
all the fruit all over it,
even though I love fruit.
Oh, okay.

794
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,367
I hope that it tastes
a lot better than it looks.

795
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:33,767
I think
the raspberry buttercream,

796
00:30:33,767 --> 00:30:35,000
it's almost like a mousse.

797
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,433
-Ooh.
-And it's really good.

798
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,833
I'm not getting any lemon
in the cookie.

799
00:30:38,833 --> 00:30:40,200
Oh.

800
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,567
Don't say the L word
unless you're gonna deliver,

801
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:44,367
because she's gonna be
all over you for it.

802
00:30:44,367 --> 00:30:46,667
I think you might have
over-mixed your cookie

803
00:30:46,667 --> 00:30:48,367
dough a little bit.
Oh?

804
00:30:48,367 --> 00:30:50,733
Because it's not as tender
as I want a sugar cookie to be.

805
00:30:50,733 --> 00:30:52,067
-Oh, okay.
-You know?

806
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,533
-All right. Ice it up.
-Thanks, Alex.

807
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:57,167
-Okay. Bye.
-See you, buddy.

808
00:30:57,167 --> 00:30:58,033
How's it going, Michael?

809
00:30:58,033 --> 00:30:59,133
Good.

810
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,567
So, tell us what you made
for us today.

811
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,200
I made a peanut butter
cookie cake...
Mmm.

812
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,967
and I used
a peanut butter buttercream.

813
00:31:04,967 --> 00:31:09,067
So, you had to put your name
on it, an edible name.
Yes.

814
00:31:09,067 --> 00:31:11,067
-I see a "Muh..."
-Muh?

815
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:13,333
-Yeah. [ Laughs ]
-Just here you go.

816
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:15,533
I got three-quarters of an "M:
and just here you go.

817
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,733
-Just get it on there.
-What happened, Michael?

818
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,467
I was trying to do
the "P" in my name.

819
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,267
Like I was trying
to do my initials

820
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:22,467
'cause I didn't have any time
to do my whole name

821
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,067
and it
just scattered everywhere.

822
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:27,833
Okay. So, you did not fulfill
that particular challenge,

823
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:29,067
but how does it taste?

824
00:31:29,067 --> 00:31:31,633
Oh, yeah.

825
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:33,867
Wait a minute.
What's going on in here?

826
00:31:33,867 --> 00:31:35,400
What's going on?
Hold on.

827
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,733
How'd you make this
peanut butter cookie dough?

828
00:31:37,733 --> 00:31:39,600
I made just like a chocolate
chip cookie cake,

829
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,200
but instead of using
chocolate chips

830
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,633
I used peanut butter chips.

831
00:31:42,633 --> 00:31:45,400
It's like a peanut butter
blondie cookie.

832
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,467
Perfect consistency, but --
but I just wish there was more

833
00:31:50,467 --> 00:31:52,500
of a punch
of peanut butter, you know?

834
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,400
The frosting's very,
very sweet.

835
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,767
As soon as you put it
in your mouth,

836
00:31:55,767 --> 00:31:56,967
it's like woo, that's sweet.

837
00:31:56,967 --> 00:31:58,667
There's a lot of sugar in here.

838
00:31:58,667 --> 00:31:59,567
Thanks a lot, Michael.

839
00:31:59,567 --> 00:32:01,333
Thank you.
It's too sweet.

840
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,067
Aren't cakes supposed
to be sweet?

841
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:04,567
Wow.

842
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,233
I could have put up with
the sweetness of the cookie

843
00:32:06,233 --> 00:32:08,367
had he pulled back
the sugar in the frosting.

844
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:11,400
-Or vice versa.
-No, the cookie needed to be.

845
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,100
-All right, Chef.

-I was adamant, too. No.

You know, Duff, cookie cakes --
I think we're starting a trend.

849
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,667
Yeah, I think I'm gonna make
a million bucks off it, too.

850
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:33,067
Hey, Bryn.
How'd you do today?

851
00:32:33,067 --> 00:32:35,500
It was crazy,
and it was surreal.

-11.
-11?

00:32:38,933 --> 00:32:41,167
I don't think I used the word
"surreal" when I was 11.

-No. [ Laughs ]
-[ Giggles ]

So, explain to us
what you made for us.

858

Well, today I made
a snickerdoodle cookie cake

859
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,133
and it's just regular vanilla
frosting with sprinkles inside.

-It is. It's magical.

I'm only going to put a little
bit of these spices in because,

445
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:04,400
you know, I want that
hot pepper to be the star.

446
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,633
And I know that the seeds
are always

447
00:18:05,633 --> 00:18:06,667
the hottest part of a pepper,

448
00:18:06,667 --> 00:18:09,067
so I scrape those in
so to give it

The ricotta will make a really
nice addition to my buttercream,

a lot creamier.

My plan for using the twist

461
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,567
is to incorporate basil
into my frosting.

462
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:53,167
I'm going to do this by
cooking raspberry puree

463
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:55,067
and basil leaves together.

464
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:58,533
Then I'm going to sift them,
so I get out the basil leaves

465
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,100
and add that to
vanilla buttercream.

466

I have not used
this technique before,

in some places in a cookbook,

618
00:25:27,767 --> 00:25:31,067
with a candied pecan,
almond, and basil crunch.

619
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:34,567
I just take a handful of the
crunch and sprinkle that on top,

620
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:37,600
and I chop up whatever
left of the basil I have

621
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,833
and just sprinkle that
in the center.

622
00:25:40,833 --> 00:25:44,233
I want to make sure that
it looks pretty at the end.

623
00:25:44,233 --> 00:25:46,367
I'm rushing to get
my whipped cream on.

624
00:25:46,367 --> 00:25:49,300
I start sprinkling on
some walnuts and dulce de leche

625
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,867
on top of the whipped cream.

626
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:53,467
15 seconds.

627
00:25:53,467 --> 00:25:55,267
SOLEIL:
I'm not feeling so great.

628
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:58,467
My ganache is running off
the sides and super liquid-y.

629
00:25:58,467 --> 00:26:02,700
This did not turn out
the way I wanted to.

630
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:07,067
DUFF: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

631
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:09,733
-Hands up!
-Yay!

632
00:26:09,733 --> 00:26:11,733
All right!

633
00:26:11,733 --> 00:26:19,467
Yours looks so good.
Mine looks horrible.

634
00:26:19,467 --> 00:26:20,900
-Wow.
-Who did this?

635
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,067
* Julia *

636
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,900
That's stunning.

637
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,200
Julia!

638
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,700
Got to go.

639
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,100
[ Laughs ]

640
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,500
'Cause they're not
nervous enough.

641
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,100
Right. [ Laughs ]
That was just for fun.

642
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,633
Tell us about your pizza.
What'd you make?

643
00:26:35,633 --> 00:26:38,600
I made a blondie crust
filled with lemon curd,

644
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,433
and on top is
a raspberry-basil buttercream.

645
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,933
-Wow.
-Is pink your thing?

646
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,100
-Yes.
-Yeah?

647
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:47,967
-I love it.
-I get it.

648
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,933
It's understated.
It's clean.

649
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:52,500
It's really nice.

650
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,833
**

651
00:26:54,833 --> 00:27:00,533
I wish the lemon curd
stayed in there more.

652
00:27:00,533 --> 00:27:03,233
-It's a little loose.
-Yeah. It's a little loose.

653
00:27:03,233 --> 00:27:04,067
Yeah.
It almost looks
like an egg yolk.

654
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:07,367
It's cooked.

655
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:09,500
It's chewy, which is good.

656
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,367
Such a beautiful dessert.
I'm a little disappointed...

657
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:14,567
Mm-hmm.
...because the lemon curd
is so runny,

658
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,333
and the buttercream
is too buttery.

659
00:27:16,333 --> 00:27:18,900
Mm-hmm.
But I love
the raspberry flavor.

660
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,833
I got to tell you, too.
I didn't get any basil.

661
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:22,367
Okay.

662
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:23,600
And I think that it would've
been delicious on this pizza.

663
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,200
It just needs to be
tweaked a bit more,

664
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,700
but you are obviously
very talented.

665
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,833
Thank you.

666
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:29,800
Thanks, Julia.

667
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:32,400
**

668
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,433
-That's too bad.
-It's a shame.

669
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,067
I know.
Because it was so beautiful.

670
00:27:35,067 --> 00:27:37,367
You're like, "Oh, please, like,
let this work. Let this work."

671
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,800
-Yeah. And then it didn't.
-That's a shame.

672
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:43,333
**

673
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:46,267
Grady, it looks exactly
like a pizza.

674
00:27:46,267 --> 00:27:47,767
-It really does.
-Exactly.

675
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:50,700
What you have here is
a shortbread pizza crust

676
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,833
with a raspberry coulis
and a cream cheese frosting

677
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:56,700
with basil on it
and then raspberries on the top.

678
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,433
-Oh, nice.
-Wow.

679
00:27:58,433 --> 00:28:00,367
Good slice. Yeah.
That's good.

680
00:28:00,367 --> 00:28:01,967
That's good. [ Laughs ]

681
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:05,767
I really, really love
that cream cheese frosting.

682
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:07,933
When you get a piece of basil,
you can taste it.

683
00:28:07,933 --> 00:28:09,367
Yes.

684
00:28:09,367 --> 00:28:10,267
When you don't get a piece
of basil, you can't.

685
00:28:10,267 --> 00:28:11,400
Yeah.

686
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,833
It's just the tiniest bit
underbaked.

687
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:18,333
I agree. I think maybe just
a few more minutes in the oven.

688
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:20,700
Man, I can't get over how much
like a pizza it looks.

689
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,967
Thank you.

690
00:28:21,967 --> 00:28:25,967

-Hi.
-Hey, Linsey.

692
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,633
Tell us what you made.

693
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:33,933
I made an apple pie dessert
pizza with a candied pecan,

694
00:28:33,933 --> 00:28:36,800
almond and basil crunch
on top.

695
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,933
This is a beautiful pizza.

696
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:43,267
You made a great crust.

697
00:28:43,267 --> 00:28:44,567
I love the crunch on top.

698
00:28:44,567 --> 00:28:46,267
-Mm-hmm.
-I don't taste any basil.

699
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:48,067
-[ Mouth full ] You're crazy.
-I don't.

700
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:49,267
Okay.

701
00:28:49,267 --> 00:28:51,867
I think you got way
too much spices.

702
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:56,800
It needs some acid to break up
the cinnamon flavor in there.

703
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,567
**

704
00:28:59,567 --> 00:29:01,333
Thanks, Linsey.

705
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:04,067
I've actually got a little
cinnamon tongue burn.

706
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:09,100

707
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,067
-Hello.
-How's it going, Abby?

708
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,667
-Good.
-Tell us about your pizza.

709
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:18,067
My pizza is a blondie crust with
maple cream cheese frosting,

710
00:29:18,067 --> 00:29:21,800
candied pecans,
pretzels, and bacon,

711
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,567
and a homemade caramel sauce.

712
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:26,667
That sounds terrible.
[ Laughter ]

713
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:28,133
-Ugh.
-Ugh.

714
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:31,867
You are killing me.

715
00:29:31,867 --> 00:29:33,667
I got the bacon piece.

716
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,767
[ Laughter ]

717
00:29:35,767 --> 00:29:38,633
Mmm.

718
00:29:38,633 --> 00:29:41,233
[ Mouth full ] I got to get as
much bacon as I can.

719
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:43,800
The maple is the very
first thing I taste,

720
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,333
and I love it.

721
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:49,733
Tell me how you got the maple
into the cream cheese.

722
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:51,433
A maple extract.

723
00:29:51,433 --> 00:29:54,400
-Oh, that's why it's so strong.
-[ Singsongy ] Thought so.

724
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,333
I think you used
a little too much.

725
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,067
It's a little extract-y.

726
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,800
I think it's baked absolutely
perfect for a blondie.

727
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,733
The crunch of the bacon...
The caramel is beautifully done.

728
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,567
I'm incredibly impressed.

00:30:05,567 --> 00:30:06,567

-Good.

734
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:16,667

with dulce de leche
with walnuts,

736

and then with
a twist of basil.

00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,100
Okay.
I can see the basil.

738
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,267
Where else did you put it?

739
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:26,333
-Into the apple mixture.
-Oh.

740
00:30:26,333 --> 00:30:29,833
Well, I gotta tell you
this really looks beautiful.

741
00:30:29,833 --> 00:30:31,900
Thank you.

742
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,067
I think you probably didn't bake
this pie crust long enough.

743
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,367
It looks a little blonde.

744
00:30:37,367 --> 00:30:40,133
It looks a little like you,
a little blonde.

-I think Duffy is right.

Okay.

747
00:30:42,967 --> 00:30:46,000
It is very underbaked.

751

Um...
Let's start with the pie crust.

752
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,267
There's, like, nothing going on.

753
00:30:58,267 --> 00:30:59,867
-It's got zero flavor.
-Okay.

754
00:30:59,867 --> 00:31:02,267
And it's not baked long enough.

755
00:31:02,267 --> 00:31:04,800
That being said, everything
on top is really good.

756
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,300
Your apples are delicious.

757
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:09,133
The basil's nice and big,
and I love dulce de leche.

758
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:10,367
-Good job.
-Thank you.

759
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,667
Whipped cream is so luscious.

760
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,300
And with the dulce de leche,

761
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,733
the sugar in there
is really yummy.

762
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:17,900
And I do taste the basil.

763
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:21,367
-Thanks, Bryn.
-Thank you.

764
00:31:21,367 --> 00:31:23,067
Well, how about that?

765
00:31:23,067 --> 00:31:25,967
-Wow.
-Isn't that pretty?

766
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,667
It looks like little
Bufala mozzarella.

767
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:30,500
-Alex.
-Tell us what you made for us.

768
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,067
So I did, like,
a pie crust pizza

769
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:34,333
topped with chocolate ganache,

770
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,500
which I incorporated
those cayenne peppers,

771
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,333
and then topped it
with some whipped creme

772
00:31:38,333 --> 00:31:39,733
for, like, to settle down
your palate

773
00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,467
a little bit after you have,
like, the hot ganache,

774
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,767
and then I topped it
with some fresh strawberries

775
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:46,667
and some sprinkles
'cause I love sprinkles.

776
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,133
And did you make
your whipped cream?

777
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,800
Yes. Of course.
By hand.

778
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,300
-Of course.
-[ Scoffs ]

779
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,900
Bakers don't use
canned whipped cream.

780
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,067
Right?
Hey, I like that stuff.
[ Laughs ]

781
00:31:56,067 --> 00:31:57,533
It looks beautiful.

782
00:31:57,533 --> 00:32:00,433
Love how the strawberries
match the sprinkles,

783
00:32:00,433 --> 00:32:03,433
and the crumbles on top
match the pie crust.

784
00:32:03,433 --> 00:32:04,433
Yeah.

785
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,900
Really thought about that,
didn't you?

786
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,333
-Yeah.
-Look at that nice slice.

787
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:08,600
-Ooh!
-Look at that.

788
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,100
Alex, man, you did a 180
from last week.

789
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,367
I want to go for
redemption this week.

We'll see.

Goodness gracious.

793
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:21,867
The way that your pie crust
is nice and salty.

794
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:24,967
Yeah.
And it's not too sweet,
blends perfectly

795
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:26,467
with that nice,
thick ganache.

796
00:32:26,467 --> 00:32:27,467
-Thank you.
-Really good.

797
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:28,567
So delicious.

798
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:31,800
Unfortunately, there's
no chili flavor.

799
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:34,767
I got zero chilies.

800
00:32:34,767 --> 00:32:35,900

-Thank you, Alex.
-Nice pizza.

00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:38,500
-Thank you.
-Okay.

803
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,467
I was expecting them to be like,
"Whew, that's spicy."

00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:43,767
-There's just no heat.
-There's no heat.

of a waffle.

It looks like a giant waffle.

Hey, Aditya.

00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,567
-Hello.
-Hey.

811
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:57,367
Tell us what you made
for us here today.

812
00:32:57,367 --> 00:33:01,467
I made a dessert pizza
with a snickerdoodle crust

813
00:33:01,467 --> 00:33:05,233
without the cinnamon, and I also
made vanilla pastry cream,

814
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:07,300
and it's topped
with strawberries,

815
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,467
candied basil
and caramel sauce.

816
00:33:10,467 --> 00:33:12,667
A snickerdoodle
without the cinnamon --

817
00:33:12,667 --> 00:33:15,733
is that really
a snickerdoodle, then?
No.

818
00:33:15,733 --> 00:33:18,067
-Or is it just a doodle?
-It's an Aditya-doodle.

819
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:20,333
It's an Aditya-doodle.

I love that you went
for it, man.

821
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:24,733
I love all this color.
I love how wild it is.

822
00:33:24,733 --> 00:33:26,300
This is weird.

823
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,967
What's going on here?

824
00:33:27,967 --> 00:33:30,200
That's candied basil.

825

[ Crunching ]

826
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:35,233
[ Mouth full ] Mmm,
but the basil got overheated,

827
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,700
so it's a little bitter.

828
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:39,600
-Wow.
-Okay.

829
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,100
-That's a lot underbaked.
-That's a lot underbaked.

830
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,300
Yeah.
Oh, you knew it.

831
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
Yeah.

832
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,067
That part here where
it's actually baked,

833
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,533
it's really good cookie.

834
00:33:49,533 --> 00:33:51,367
You've got a lot
of interesting techniques.

835
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,533
And you're the only person
that's made pastry cream so far.

836
00:33:53,533 --> 00:33:58,433
Pastry cream is a little thick.

837
00:33:58,433 --> 00:34:00,500
This is
a really sweet dessert.

838
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,633
It's that caramel
that's so sweet,

839
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:03,433
and then it goes into
the pastry cream,

840
00:34:03,433 --> 00:34:05,700
and then the underbaked cookie,
which is super, super sweet.

841
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,967
Something could have
been pulled back.

842
00:34:08,967 --> 00:34:10,400

-Hi.
-How you feeling?

-Good.
-Yeah?

848
00:34:20,967 --> 00:34:23,733
You had a little bit
of a meltdown earlier.
Uh-huh.

849
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:25,433
How do you think
you came through that?

850
00:34:25,433 --> 00:34:27,200
I think I did
pretty well with it

851
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,300
because I still
finished in time.

852
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,367
And it looks like you got
an awesome pizza.

853
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,967
Today, I made for you
a dessert pizza

854
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,467
with chocolate hazelnut
spread,

855
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:39,100
strawberries, bananas,
and ricotta cheese.

856
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,600
My twist item
was ricotta cheese.

857
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,067
I love how you, like,
fish-scaled the bananas,

858
00:34:43,067 --> 00:34:44,067
you know...tsch-tsch-tsch,

859
00:34:44,067 --> 00:34:45,167
and then you continued it

860
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:46,867
with the strawberries
in the middle.

861
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:50,333
And I really love how you
made the little rosettes.

862
00:34:50,333 --> 00:34:52,800
Your crust looks
a little blonde.
Yeah.

863
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,567
When you're baking,
you always want to make sure

864
00:34:54,567 --> 00:34:56,167
that you get things
nice and brown

865
00:34:56,167 --> 00:34:58,600
because when things
are this color,

866
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,500
you can almost
taste that flour.

867
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,600
Okay.

868
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,200
Oh, boy.

869
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,500
Wow.

870
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,900

completely fall apart.

871
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,067

That ricotta is
perfectly sweetened.

Oh, man. Really good.
It's got great textures.

876

It's got great flavors.
I taste the ricotta.

877
00:35:18,267 --> 00:35:20,100
You used your twist ingredient
really well.

00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,167
I'm so happy to see you
come through

879
00:35:22,167 --> 00:35:23,767
that little mini-breakdown...
-Yeah.

880
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:26,233
...and come through
with something so flavorful.

Wow.

887
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:43,900
I made a thin brownie crust,
and two ganaches,

888
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,600
a white chocolate ganache
and a milk chocolate ganache,

889
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,367
and then I swirled them
together like a sauce.

890
00:35:49,367 --> 00:35:51,933
Sometimes,
pizza has two sauces.

891
00:35:51,933 --> 00:35:54,400
What was your twist ingredient,
and how did you use it?

892
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,267
Hot peppers,
so I made hot pepper

893
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:59,067
cinnamon nutmeg
whipped cream.

894
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,567
Whoa.

895
00:36:00,567 --> 00:36:02,233
Your whipped cream has got
these, kind of chunks.

896
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:03,800
I couldn't find any piping bags.

00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,600
I know.

901
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,833
If you can't find a piping bag,
just get two spoons.

902
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,567
You can make a little quenelle.

903
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:13,733
-Oh, sure. Why not?
-Um...

904
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:16,633
You know how long it takes
to learn how to make a quenelle?

they're the best.

and white chocolate ganache.

a very beautiful dish.

I'm going to try a little bit
of your spicy whipped cream.

Comes in after a bit.

917
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,533
It doesn't taste spicy-hot
to me at all.

918
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:46,967
Remember, there's a lot of fat
in whipped cream,

919
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:50,567
so you can afford to pump in
some more spice in there.

920
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,733
Having said that,
this is really delicious.

921
00:36:53,733 --> 00:36:55,167
Yay.

922
00:36:55,167 --> 00:36:57,867
I love the creaminess
of the ganache on top,

923
00:36:57,867 --> 00:37:00,067
and it goes really well
with your brownie,

924
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,767
which is super-duper
moist and dense.

925
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:02,800
It's real chocolaty.

00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,167
You know, I've got
white chocolate,

927
00:37:04,167 --> 00:37:05,933
milk chocolate,
brownie chocolate,

928
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:08,700
whipped cream on top, a little
tiny bit of smokiness...

00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:11,067
-At least you got a little.
-It's a good job, kid.

raspberry buttercream
with ricotta,

935

a fresh raspberry "G."

could have been a lot neater.

-Oh, okay.
-So I expect a lot from you.

All right.

948
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:53,500
The ricotta really salted
down the buttercream,

949
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:57,300
so it's not super sweet.
I can taste the raspberry.

950

There's a lot of
good flavors in there.

what I'm tasting

to my eyes.

undersweet.

in the crust

and then take almonds and
put them on the top of my crust

80
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,533
so the crust is baking
and the almonds are toasted.

81
00:03:54,533 --> 00:03:58,367

my lemon filling in,

89
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,533
For my crust, I need butter.

90
00:04:23,533 --> 00:04:26,233
Do you know how many ounces
three sticks of butter would be?

91
00:04:26,233 --> 00:04:27,967
One stick is four.

92
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,133
One?
Wait, one cup is four?

93
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:32,400
-One cup is eight.
-One cup is eight ounces.

94
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,600
GRADY: Oh, okay.

95
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,933
But one stick of butter
is only half a cup.

96
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:39,533
I'm very confused about
how much butter I need.

97
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,233
Hey.

98
00:04:42,233 --> 00:04:45,067
That is a lot of butter.

99
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:46,433
GRADY: Whee!

100
00:04:46,433 --> 00:04:49,767
My dough is ready,
so I put that in the oven.

101
00:04:49,767 --> 00:04:50,800
DUFF: Oh, look, lemons.

102
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,200
When will we have
a bacon day?

103
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,800
I want a bacon day.
I want a bacon tree.

104
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,667
**

105
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,900
Hey, what's up, man?

106
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,133
All right,
so you've been having

107
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:02,600
a little roller-coaster ride,
haven't you?

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,833
Um, well, yeah.

109
00:05:03,833 --> 00:05:05,700
You were, like, super awesome
the first week.

110
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Second week, you were...

111
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,400
I definitely want to win
this challenge.

112
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,533
I think -- yeah.

113
00:05:10,533 --> 00:05:12,233
I was in the bottom
three last week

114
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,367
and I definitely don't want
to do that again.

115
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,767
What is your lemon BFF?

116
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:18,133
It's blueberry.

117
00:05:18,133 --> 00:05:20,467
Lemon blueberry is one
of the most delicious things

118
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,533
on the planet.
-Yeah.

119
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,533
I'm making
a normal lemon bar

120
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:27,533
with a blueberry coulis
drizzled over it.

121
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,667
To make my shortbread crust,
I'm using powdered sugar

122
00:05:30,667 --> 00:05:36,100
because that gives the crust
a smoother feel to it.

123
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,633
To make my lemon filling,

124
00:05:37,633 --> 00:05:40,233
I whisk together
the sugar and eggs,

125
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:42,833
add the lemon juice
and lemon zest,

126
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:48,200
and then I finish it off
with a bit of orange extract,

127
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,600
'cause I think
the orange flavor

128
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,467
complements the flavor
of the lemon.

129
00:05:52,467 --> 00:05:55,633
90 minutes, bakers!
You have 90 minutes left!

130
00:05:55,633 --> 00:05:57,633
Remember, this time
is deceiving, bakers,

131
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,633
because those lemon bars
got to chill

132
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:01,167
so you can make
the shakes.

133
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,267
You got to chill.

134
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:03,967
I got to chill.

135
00:06:03,967 --> 00:06:06,200
That's two...

136
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,967
Oh, math.
Geez.

137
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:12,133
My lemon BFF is ginger, so I
am making a shortbread crust,

138
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:14,133
which I'm gonna
incorporate ground ginger.

139
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:17,633
You can smell that
delicious ginger.

140
00:06:17,633 --> 00:06:18,900
Oh, smells like heaven.

141
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,167
I think my inspiration
behind this lemon bar

142
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:24,067
is the lemon ginger tea
that I love to drink.

143
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,100
Ooh!

144
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,467
Some got in my eye there.

145
00:06:26,467 --> 00:06:28,633
It's a big part of wintertime.

146
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,267
Hi!
-Hi, Alex.

147
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:34,300
-Hello.
-I love ginger!

148
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,767
Yeah, I put it
in my crust.

149
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:38,267
Did you use real ginger
or did you use ginger spice?

150
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,367
Uh, ground ginger.

151
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,567
Ground ginger, okay.
I see.

152
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,900
So, you know ground ginger
is a little bit more

153
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:45,433
mellow than real ginger?

154
00:06:45,433 --> 00:06:48,733
Oh, my God.
What am I gonna do?

155
00:06:48,733 --> 00:06:51,567
I'm scared that they're
gonna get no ginger.

156
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:53,700
Ginger, ginger, ginger.
Think, think, think.

157
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:57,500
I decide to make a ginger juice,
ginger beer reduction.

158
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,933
This is probably
the weirdest thing

159
00:06:58,933 --> 00:07:01,500
I've ever done,
but why not try?

160
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,233
**

161
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:05,833
BOY: Julia,
what are you doing?

162
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:07,500
Cherries, I don't know.

163
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,433
I'm worried that
since I got cherry,

164
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:12,833
my filling will be too runny
since I'm gonna add puree.

165
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:16,767
But I'm also excited because
it's gonna turn out pink!

166
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:19,133
Pink is my signature color.

167
00:07:19,133 --> 00:07:22,933
Once my crust is cooled, I pour
that into my pan with the crust.

168
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:25,900
I put that in the oven
and hope that it cooks right.

169
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:28,800
**

170
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,567
Since my mom is Caribbean,
I've worked with coconut before.

171
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:37,400
So, what I'm making is
a coconut lemon bar.

172
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,867
My lemon curd has a little
bit of coconut cream in it

173
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:46,167
with some shredded coconut
in my shortbread crust.

174
00:07:46,167 --> 00:07:47,933
Alex, are you in the top?

175
00:07:47,933 --> 00:07:49,233
Yeah.

176
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,133
Do you mind if I put
mine in there, too?

177
00:07:50,133 --> 00:07:51,400
Yeah, for sure.

178
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,567
I start walking
towards the oven...

179
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,500
Shoot!

180
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,600
You've got to be kidding me.

181
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,833
Since my ganache
sort of overflowed

182
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:04,200
on my pizza last week,
this cannot happen this week.

183
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,267
So, I just grab, like,
a ginormous sheet try,

184
00:08:07,267 --> 00:08:10,967
and I put it on there.

185
00:08:10,967 --> 00:08:12,367
Thank you.
-Uh-huh, no problem.

186
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:14,333
Grady, thank you!
Such a gentleman.

187
00:08:16,467 --> 00:08:18,167
BEVERLY: Everyone else is
going in the oven,

188
00:08:18,167 --> 00:08:21,600
and I'm still nowhere
near done with my dough.

189
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,300
My BFF is walnuts.

190
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,300
I decide to toast my walnuts
in the oven

191
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,867
so that I can bring out
the flavor in them.

192
00:08:29,867 --> 00:08:32,533
And then crush them up
in the food processor

193
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:36,067
and substitute those
for some of the flour.

194
00:08:36,067 --> 00:08:38,167
I definitely get walnut.
This is good.

195
00:08:38,167 --> 00:08:40,533
I realized that everyone
else is, like,

196
00:08:40,533 --> 00:08:42,467
already putting their crust
back in the oven

197
00:08:42,467 --> 00:08:45,233
to bake the second time
with the curd on it,

198
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:49,067
and I haven't even
gotten mine in the oven.

199
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:51,633
That's a little scary.

200
00:08:51,633 --> 00:08:53,567
Oh, yeah, oven mitts,
where are you?

201
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,767
There you are.

202
00:08:54,767 --> 00:08:57,467
One hour left, bakers.

203
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,867
One hour.

204
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,733
Oh!

205
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:03,333
My bad.

206
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:07,100
My grandma, she really,
really loves my lemon bars.

207
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,067
So, I need to make
these lemon bars like

208
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,967
I'm making them for her.

209
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,267
I got it.

210
00:09:13,267 --> 00:09:14,433
I got it, Linsey,
don't worry about it.

211
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:16,600
Thanks.

212
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,067
How'd you put the pecans
in the filling?

213
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:21,500
I just kind of crushed them
and put them on top of my crust,

214
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,067
and then when I poured
in the filling,

215
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:25,400
they kind of went
all over the place.

216
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
Linsey's perfectly dressed
for the challenge today.

217
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,300
She's all in yellow.

218
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,900
What's up
with your shirt?

219
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,467
I got lemons!

220
00:09:33,467 --> 00:09:36,067
Do you think I like them?
-Eh.

221
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,967
Blackberry.

222
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:41,133
My crust is still kind of warm,
but the clock is ticking down,

223
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:43,500
so I take the crust,

224
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,067
and I line blackberries
in rows on it

225
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:49,833
because that was
my lemon bar BFF.

226
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:53,800
And then I pour the curd over it
so that way, when I cut it out,

227
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,167
every single bar has
one blackberry in them.

228
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,700
Thank you.

229
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,200
I test my crust
with a toothpick...

230
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Yep.

231
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,000
...and it looks done,
so I start to pour my curd on.

232
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,467
**

233
00:10:12,467 --> 00:10:14,000
Come on!

234
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,867
The curd's too heavy,
so it breaks through the crust

235
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,067
and leaks.

236
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:21,400
The crust is coming up.

237
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,600
I don't have time to start over.

238
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,600
Ugh.

239
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,700
**

240
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,533
BFF lemon bars to keep your
place in the competition!

241
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:41,667
**

242
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:43,200
Come on!

243
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,167
I don't have time to start over.

244
00:10:45,167 --> 00:10:48,100
I'm hoping, in the oven,
everything will level out

245
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,733
and that it'll bake fine.

246
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,100
I hope it works out.

247
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,133
I have the best idea.

248
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:58,033
Bakers, can I have
your attention please?

249
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,100
-No!
-No!

250
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,133
Val needs more lemon!

251
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,367
What the heck?

252
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:06,133
So, you must also create

253
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:10,100
an edible
lemon decoration.

254
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:13,433
Edible lemon decoration?

255
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:17,300
So, it has to look
like a lemon...

256
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,700
What looks like a lemon?

257
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,700
...and be edible.

258
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,100
Julia.

259
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,767
So, what are you doing
for your twist?

260
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:25,667
Candied lemons.

261
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,933
How are you doing that?

262
00:11:26,933 --> 00:11:29,233
In a pot, you heat together,
like, water, sugar,

263
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,967
and lemon juice,
like, a little bit,

264
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:34,067
and then you add in
slices of lemon.

265
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
As soon as they cool,
it looks like they have, like,

266
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,500
sugar on them.
It's pretty cool.

267
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,300
42 minutes!

268
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:44,567
-How many?
-42 minutes!

269
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:46,600
20?!
Wait, how many minutes?

270
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,767
42!

271
00:11:47,767 --> 00:11:50,267
Oh, I thought
you said 20.

272
00:11:50,267 --> 00:11:51,700
-Abby.
-Hi, Duff!

273
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,067
-How's it going over here?
-Good.

274
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:56,767
[ Gasps ] Look!
Extra strawberries?

275
00:11:56,767 --> 00:11:57,733
Extra strawberries.

276
00:11:57,733 --> 00:11:59,067
You're extra.

277
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,167
I know.
So are you.

278
00:12:01,167 --> 00:12:04,067
What are you
making there?

279
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,567
I'm making
sugar-cookie dough.

280
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,300
For your
edible decoration?

281
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,900
Yeah, I'm gonna try and make
it look like this.

282
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,433
Okay.
Good luck, Chef.

283
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:13,733
Thank you!

284
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,067
While my sugar cookie is baking,
I make my frosting.

285
00:12:17,067 --> 00:12:19,833
And I add yellow
food coloring...

286
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,133
Perfect.

287
00:12:21,133 --> 00:12:23,767
...and then I pipe on
my frosting

288
00:12:23,767 --> 00:12:26,900
to make it look
like a lemon wedge.

289
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,700
It smells good in here.

290
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,667
For the twist,
I'm making an actual lemon.

291
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,867
My idea is to take
yellow coating chocolate

292
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:38,100
and put that into a round
silicone bowl, and then...

293
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,333
Don't burn, please.
Oh, no.

294
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:43,067
...I make
some rice cereal treats.

295
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:46,833
I take my rice cereal treats and
shove them into my sph-- pheres.

296
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,467
Spheres.

297
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,333
I have problems with shapes
and all that kind of stuff.

298
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,467
Okay.

299
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,467
Then I take some more
melted chocolate

300
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,567
and put it around the edges.

301
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:01,500
And I have a whole lemon
ready to serve to Duff and Val.

302
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:04,467
Bryn, have you made
your curd yet?

303
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:06,133
Yep.

304
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:08,367
I start late on everything.

305
00:13:08,367 --> 00:13:11,333
I'm doing terrible on time.

306
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:17,233
And now we need to make
an edible lemon decoration.

307
00:13:17,233 --> 00:13:20,733
This is the last thing I need!

308
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:24,100
So, I immediately just
throw together lemons

309
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
dipped in powdered sugar.

310
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,200
Powdered sugar lemon is amazing.

311
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,567
In my house, we call this candy.

312
00:13:30,567 --> 00:13:32,100
Yum!

313
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,700
I like to lick them.

314
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,833
It looks like a lemon.

315
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,733
It is a lemon.
This counts.

316
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:39,567
So, I'm like...

317
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,067
Phewf!

318
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,967
Don't spill on me.

319
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:45,867
Finally, my curd is done.

320
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,133
Mmm!

321
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:51,500
And then I pour it
over my crust.

322
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,400
This is not enough lemon curd.

323
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,933
Uh-oh.

324
00:13:55,933 --> 00:14:01,467
I can't just serve this much
layer of curd to the judges.

325
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,833
In some places, this much.
None!

326
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:06,267
I'll have to make it again.

327
00:14:06,267 --> 00:14:08,400
So, I quickly throw together
a lemon curd.

328
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,133
I don't even cool, I just
throw it on my lemon bars

329
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,967
and get it in the oven.

330
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:15,900
It is what it is.

331
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,200
Edible lemon.
Edible lemon.

332
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,067
I have no clue
what I'm going to do.

333
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:22,967
So, I just think, "Fondant."

334
00:14:22,967 --> 00:14:24,233
Fondant, fondant,
yellow, yellow.

335
00:14:24,233 --> 00:14:26,933
Oh, come on!
There's no yellow fondant.

336
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,433
I grab yellow fondant, and then
I roll it out in the sheeter,

337
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,700
and then I cut it into
small little circles,

338
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,133
and then I grab
this little tracing tool,

339
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:38,700
and then I make those little
designs to represent a lemon.

340
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:41,167
I think they look awesome.

341
00:14:41,167 --> 00:14:43,533
Edible decoration.

342
00:14:43,533 --> 00:14:46,200
I have the idea to freeze
some buttercream,

343
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,800
and I think
it's gonna work well,

344
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,267
and I think it's
pretty creative,

345
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:51,433
'cause I don't see
anyone else doing this.

346
00:14:51,433 --> 00:14:54,800
I use my super-quick
batter-making skills,

347
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,267
and I whip up
this lemon buttercream.

348
00:14:57,267 --> 00:14:59,067
Did you have the lemon extract?

349
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:00,233
Yeah, I do.
Do you want it?

350
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,633
Yeah, can I borrow it?

351
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,333
I grab a mold and start
piping it in.

352
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,733
Hopefully,
they'll freeze in time.

353
00:15:08,733 --> 00:15:11,400
Hmm. Hmm.

354
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,900
So, I'm kind of confused
about the twist at first.

355
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:19,633
But then I realized, "Oh, I can
just make a rice cereal treat."

356
00:15:19,633 --> 00:15:21,367
Bryn, are you done
with the rice cereal?

357
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:22,500
Yeah.

358
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,100
I have to grab the rice
cereal from Bryn,

359
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:24,933
and that's when I realize...

360
00:15:24,933 --> 00:15:26,267
Thank you.

361
00:15:26,267 --> 00:15:29,533
...she's making
the same thing as me.

362
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:32,467
I have to do this
better than her.

363
00:15:32,467 --> 00:15:35,600
I dip the rice cereal treat in
some yellow coating chocolate,

364
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,067
and then green fondant
so I can make a little leaf.

365
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,833
Are you frying
blueberries?

366
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:42,900
-No!
-Oh, okay.

367
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,267
ADITYA: I'm washing them.

368
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm getting started
on my blueberry coulis,

369
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,800
and now we have a twist.

370
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,067
It just seems kind of...

371
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,833
kind of annoying right now.

372
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:55,300
To make the coulis,
I throw the blueberries, sugar,

373
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,100
and lemon juice
in a sauce pan,

374
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:01,100
and then just stir it until all
the blueberries are broken down

375
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,667
and released all their juices.

376
00:16:02,667 --> 00:16:04,433
Luke, what are you
planning to do

377
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:06,800
for your lemon
decoration thingy?

378
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,300
Rice cereal treats.

379
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:12,667
I kind of really don't want
to do this twist.

380
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:15,533
So, I decide to make
candied lemon slices.

381
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:17,967
I first get started
on the sugar syrup

382
00:16:17,967 --> 00:16:20,467
and I drop a lemon in there.

383
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:24,167
The sugar syrup is way too thick
and it's sticking to the lemon,

384
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,300
and it's not, like, going well.

385
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,233
I'll probably have to think
of something else

386
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,300
before time runs out,

387
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,100
but I don't know
what to do yet.

388
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,100
Lemon BFF bars,

389
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,367
and I get an edible
lemon decoration.

390
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:43,067
-I don't.
-'Cause I'm special.

391
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:45,067
I'm not.

392
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:46,867
Just work on the garnishes.

393
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:50,733
I just finished making my
lemon wedges and mint leaves.

394
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,967
Does this count?

395
00:16:54,967 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm a little confused.

396
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
What can I do with that?
What can I do with that?

397
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,767
So, I take yellow and white
coating chocolate

398
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:04,700
and I pipe out a lemon slice.

399
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,867
Today, I'm really
stepping up my game,

400
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:11,600
because last two weeks, I've
been in the bottom-middle area,

401
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,700
and I don't want
to be there again.

402
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,700
All right, 30 minutes
left, guys!

403
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:22,200
Lemon bar BFFs
with a lemon decoration.

404
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:27,467
So, for the twist, I'm going
with a rice cereal treat.

405
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:30,667
Once I have it done,
I form it into, like,

406
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:32,533
a roundish sort of thing,

407
00:17:32,533 --> 00:17:35,333
and then I air-brush it yellow.

408
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,967
Oh, that looks awesome!

409
00:17:37,967 --> 00:17:39,433
BRYN: Hot over here!

410
00:17:39,433 --> 00:17:43,067
I go take out my lemon bars
and it looks done.

411
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:44,733
I test it with a toothpick...

412
00:17:44,733 --> 00:17:45,833
Oh, no!

413
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,300
No, no, no, no, no!

414
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,200
No, no. No, no.
No, no. No, no.

415
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,533
It is liquidy inside.

416
00:17:51,533 --> 00:17:55,200
This is definitely not what
it's supposed to look like.

417
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,200
I have no idea what to do.

418
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:07,900
Oh, no!

419
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,400
My filling looks like water.

420
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,133
I have no idea what to do.

421
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,367
What's going on?

422
00:18:14,367 --> 00:18:16,400
Um, in the middle,
it's, like, oily,

423
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,100
and I don't know
what to do now.

424
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,533
Okay, that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

425
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,900
I think it needs to be baked
a little bit longer.

426
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,300
Okay?

427
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,800
So, put your gloves on
and get it back in the oven.

428
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,067
I'm like, "Please just
let everything bake.

429
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:29,667
Please just let
everything bake."

430
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:31,767
You'll do great.

431
00:18:31,767 --> 00:18:33,400
I believe in you.

432
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,433
All right, 30 minutes
left, guys!

433
00:18:35,433 --> 00:18:41,167
Lemon bar BFFs
with a lemon decoration.

434
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,767
Come on, sauce, boil, boil!

435
00:18:42,767 --> 00:18:44,500
Reduce, reduce, reduce.

436
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,900
I'm looking at my reduction and
I realize nothing's happening,

437
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,100
it's still pure liquid.

438
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,533
This is not gonna work.

439
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:53,767
How else can I put ginger
into this dessert?

440
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:54,733
Whipped cream.

441
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,200
I wonder.

442
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,967
Oh!
I can do a ginger whipped cream.

443
00:18:58,967 --> 00:19:01,633
I whip that up
until stiff peaks.

444
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:04,300
One of the best whipped creams
I've ever had.

445
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,500
That looks interesting.

446
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,633
Yeah.

447
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,100
This would be, like,
great on the wall.

448
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,367
You know what I mean?

449
00:19:10,367 --> 00:19:12,167
I just thought it looked
burned, but okay.

450
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,333
I like it.
It looks nice.

451
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,433
I have to use coconut
and I'm a little worried

452
00:19:17,433 --> 00:19:20,700
because I know it's not
a very strong flavor,

453
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,633
so I combine powdered sugar
with some coconut cream

454
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:30,200
and some coconut milk to make
a coconut drizzle for the top.

455
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,600
Aditya, how are you
incorporating your flavor?

456
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,467
ADITYA: I'm making
a blueberry coulis

457
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,300
and drizzling that
on the lemon bars.

458
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,467
Nice.

459
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,667
I mean, you can do
the same thing as me.

460
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,100
Mm.

461
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,067
LUKE: I decide to make
a blackberry coulis

462
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:45,533
because it's one
of the simpler ways

463
00:19:45,533 --> 00:19:47,467
to add in a blackberry flavor,

464
00:19:47,467 --> 00:19:50,300
but also one of
the best-tasting ways.

465
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,567
Oh, my gosh,
that smells delicious.

466
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,733
All right, Valerie,

467
00:19:54,733 --> 00:19:56,500
we need to get
to the bottom of something.

468
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,200
What is the root
of the lemon obsession?

469
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,933
When I was pregnant
with Wolfie,

470
00:20:01,933 --> 00:20:03,600
the only thing
to take away my nausea

471
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,700
is sucking on lemons.

472
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,433
And I began to really love
to suck on lemons

473
00:20:06,433 --> 00:20:08,433
'cause it made me
feel so much better.

474
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:09,667
Huh.

475
00:20:09,667 --> 00:20:12,100
So, not barfing
is what led you

476
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
to love lemons,
basically?

477
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,767
Yeah, basically.

478
00:20:15,767 --> 00:20:17,833
Good, that's good.

479
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:20,567
Grady, yours is turning really,
really brown on top.

480
00:20:20,567 --> 00:20:21,967
-Oh, it is?
-Yeah.

481
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:25,400
GRADY: I immediately put them
in the blast chiller

482
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,867
to cool down.

483
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:29,933
I have to make sure these lemon
bars are set up just right

484
00:20:29,933 --> 00:20:31,333
so that when I cut them,

485
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:33,933
they don't, like,
spill everywhere.

486
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,033
SOLEIL: Are you making
anything

487
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,567
for the top
of your lemon bars?

488
00:20:36,567 --> 00:20:39,800
I have a raspberry coulis
that I'm gonna drizzle on top.

489
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,533
That's gonna be good!

490
00:20:41,533 --> 00:20:43,467
13 minutes!

491
00:20:43,467 --> 00:20:45,700
I've chilled my lemon bars
and I'm ready to cut out

492
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:48,167
my lemon circles
and put everything together.

493
00:20:48,167 --> 00:20:50,433
So, I take a circle
cookie cutter

494
00:20:50,433 --> 00:20:51,667
and start cutting them out.

495
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,300
It's okay,
it's okay, it's okay.

496
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Please be done.

497
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,067
Time is almost up and I have
to get these on the plate.

498
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:02,567
As I'm cutting them,
I'm so nervous

499
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:04,667
that they are not gonna be set,

500
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:09,600
but just my luck, they were
ready to be cut into diamonds.

501
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,900
Thank goodness!

502
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:15,933
I decorate my bars
with some chocolate ganache

503
00:21:15,933 --> 00:21:19,267
and toasted
almonds on the top.

504
00:21:19,267 --> 00:21:20,867
GIRL: Those are amazing,
Julia.

505
00:21:20,867 --> 00:21:23,900
JULIA: I cut my lemon bar
into a square shape.

506
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,567
BEVERLY:
They look so pretty.

507
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:28,667
I'm really happy because they
did turn out a pretty pink.

508
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:32,433
**

509
00:21:32,433 --> 00:21:35,733
There's no time left and I
have to get these on the plate.

510
00:21:35,733 --> 00:21:38,100
Like, yesterday.

511
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,767
I cut the rectangles

512
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:43,600
and put a little bit
of strawberry coulis on top

513
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:47,067
and then I put one of my
strawberry decorations

514
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:50,633
that I already had
cut on top of that.

515
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,367
-Five minutes, guys!
-Oh, my goodness.

516
00:21:52,367 --> 00:21:54,933
VALERIE: Who wants to stay
in this competition?

517
00:21:54,933 --> 00:21:56,333
For Canada!

518
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,167
So, it's time to start
plating my lemon bars,

519
00:21:58,167 --> 00:22:00,400
so I start to cut them
into my triangle shape.

520
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,800
I can make them look nice
on the platter.

521
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,233
And I top it with the ginger
whipped cream,

522
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,600
some yellow sprinkles,
strawberries,

523
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,133
and then I put
my fondant lemon.

524
00:22:08,133 --> 00:22:09,933
That's pretty good.

525
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,433
Half my size.

526
00:22:11,433 --> 00:22:15,067
I cut out my triangles,
I get them onto the plate,

527
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:16,967
I sprinkle on
some powdered sugar,

528
00:22:16,967 --> 00:22:20,733
and then I top it with my
lemon wedges and mint leaves.

529
00:22:20,733 --> 00:22:22,300
Okay.

530
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,200
Then I look around
and a couple people have, like,

531
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,100
full lemons, like,
as a decoration,

532
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,967
and I'm like, "Oh, no.

533
00:22:28,967 --> 00:22:30,933
Did I do the whole twist wrong?"

534
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,433
Oh!
So, I start to freak out.

535
00:22:33,433 --> 00:22:35,600
-How are you doing, Linsey?
-Not good.

536
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,667
-Oh. Do you need help?
-Um, maybe.

537
00:22:37,667 --> 00:22:40,733
But then Alex comes over
and thank God!

538
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:42,267
I have some extra fondant
at my station.

539
00:22:42,267 --> 00:22:44,733
-Can I use some fondant?
-Okay. Here.

540
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,633
LINSEY: Alex gives me his
leftover yellow fondant,

541
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,067
and as quickly as I can,

542
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:51,533
I mush it up into a ball in
the most lemon shape as I can.

543
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,267
Two minutes, guys!

544
00:22:55,267 --> 00:22:57,367
Oh, I forgot about the twist.

545
00:22:57,367 --> 00:23:00,567
I'm running out of time and I
still don't have my lemon twist.

546
00:23:00,567 --> 00:23:04,367
So, I'm thinking, at this point,
I just have to use a lemon slice

547
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:06,833
and hope the judges
will be okay with it.

548
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:11,300
**

549
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,933
BEVERLY:
It isn't going through.

550
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:17,767
There's almost no time left
and I try to pull them out,

551
00:23:17,767 --> 00:23:21,133
and this is a disaster.

552
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:23,200
And it's falling apart.

553
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Oh, dear.
Oh, no.

554
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,067
She's just trying
to take them out.

555
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:27,533
They're too warm.

556
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,467
This is the only thing
I have at this point,

557
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:33,233
so I just need to get
this goop into a cup

558
00:23:33,233 --> 00:23:35,167
and call it a lemon bar.

559
00:23:35,167 --> 00:23:37,400
At least it'll taste good.

560
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,900
I can help now,
Beverly, if you need.

561
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,800
Thank you, can you help me
get it into these cups?

562
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,167
BOTH: 9...

563
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,333
8...
7...

564
00:23:44,333 --> 00:23:45,567
6...

565
00:23:45,567 --> 00:23:47,667
5...
4...

566
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:48,833
3...

567
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,667
2...
1...

568
00:23:50,667 --> 00:23:52,800
Hands up!

569
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,833
-Whoo!
-All right.

570
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,467
DUFF: Good job, guys.

571
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:59,733
Well, when there's nothing left
to do, you eat raspberries.

572
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,067
Oh, boy.

573
00:24:01,067 --> 00:24:02,833
It's lemon time!

574
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,067
I'm so excited.

575
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,700
Don't I know it.

576
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,467
Linsey!

577
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:09,933
Well,
you're all in yellow.

578
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:13,600
-Yeah.
-It's lemon day.

579
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,400
So, Linsey,
what was your lemon BFF?

580
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:20,400
I made you a lemon bar
with a shortbread pecan crust.

581
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,700
I was a bit confused about

582
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,867
what we exactly had to do
for a twist,

583
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:26,833
so I gave you a few options.

584
00:24:26,833 --> 00:24:29,100
'Cause I was not sure.

585
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,067
Oh, my God.
That's so fabulous.

586
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:34,067
I got to tell you,
your presentation

587
00:24:34,067 --> 00:24:35,933
is absolutely beautiful.

588
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:38,900
It's very elegant.

589
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,067
Except for one thing.
-Yeah.

590
00:24:41,067 --> 00:24:42,733
Your lemon bars fell apart.

591
00:24:42,733 --> 00:24:43,867
Mm-hmm.

592
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:45,800
Now,
you did use fondant.

593
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,067
I'm not fond
of fondant.

594
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:50,700
But it is edible,
so it's legal.

595
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,100
You could have gotten away

596
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,967
with just these
beautiful decorations

597
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:56,900
as you're doing here.

598
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:57,800
Definitely tasting
those pecans.

599
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,067
DUFF: Mmm!

600
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,633
Your curd
is nice and lemony.

601
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:02,667
The cookie is delicious.

602
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,800
It is a shortbread,

603
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,433
it's falling apart like
a shortbread should.

604
00:25:05,433 --> 00:25:06,400
Mm-hmm.

605
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,133
I'm definitely
tasting pecan.

606
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:09,400
Pe-can.
-Pe-can.

607
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,233
Yeah.

608
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,567
Definitely tasting pe-can.
-Pecan.

609
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,867
You got good lemon,
you got good pecan.

610
00:25:13,867 --> 00:25:14,900
-Thanks, Linsey.
-Thanks, Linsey.

611
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:16,400
-Thank you.
-See you.

612
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,133
-She's pretty impressive.
-Pretty impressive.

613
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:21,433
All right, Grady.

614
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:25,133
What I made is
a raspberry lemon bar

615
00:25:25,133 --> 00:25:27,733
with raspberry coulis on the
top.

616
00:25:27,733 --> 00:25:30,133
My lemon decoration
is a rice cereal treat

617
00:25:30,133 --> 00:25:31,367
formed into a circle,

618
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:33,100
and then I air-brushed
it yellow.

619
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,733
Yeah, I thought it was,
like, mac and cheese,

620
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:36,433
but made with, like, rice.

621
00:25:36,433 --> 00:25:38,533
Like, a risotto
mac and cheese.

622
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:40,333
And I was about to be
really excited about that,

623
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:42,100
I got to tell you.

624
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,533
Sounds yummy.

625
00:25:43,533 --> 00:25:46,167
So, I guess the question is,
does it look like a lemon?

626
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:49,100
And you know what?
I think it absolutely does.

627
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,767
All right,
let's try this guy.

628
00:25:50,767 --> 00:25:55,267
**

629
00:25:55,267 --> 00:25:57,067
It's delicious.
-Thank you.

630
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,933
-This is really good.
-Okay, great!

631
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,700
So, the lemon bars.

632
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,867
Look at that.

633
00:26:01,867 --> 00:26:04,500
Yeah,
that is weird-looking.

634
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,233
It almost looks like
you've got some frozen

635
00:26:06,233 --> 00:26:07,467
cream cheese in there.

636
00:26:07,467 --> 00:26:09,233
I don't see
any lemon curd.

637
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,900
When I took my crust
out of the oven,

638
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:14,067
I put on my lemon curd...
-Uh-huh.

639
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:17,300
...but it wasn't done
completely, so it went under.

640
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,900
So, like, it kind of went
through the crust.

641
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,567
Oh.

642
00:26:21,567 --> 00:26:25,067
Let's try it.

643
00:26:25,067 --> 00:26:27,633
I -- ooh.
I taste...

644
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:31,367
Like, it's a --
it's a mound of butter.

645
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,500
I barely taste any lemon.

646
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,067
And how much butter did you
put in the crust?

647
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,100
3 cups.

648
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,900
3 cups of butter?

649
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,067
-Mm-hmm.
-That's a lot.

650
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:46,100
I got your raspberry.
It's nice.

651
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,067
Yeah,
totally get raspberry.

652
00:26:48,067 --> 00:26:49,433
And I don't mind butter,
but it tasted like

653
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:51,233
I literally took
a slice of butter

654
00:26:51,233 --> 00:26:53,067
and put it in my mouth.

655
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:54,500
Aww, dang it.

656
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,767
That's weird.

657
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:57,900
I don't know what
went wrong where,

658
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,233
but something went wrong.

659
00:26:59,233 --> 00:27:00,967
-Okay.
-Thanks, Grady.

660
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,400
-Thanks, Grady.
-Thank you.

661
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,733
I was pretty sure
I had the butter right,

662
00:27:04,733 --> 00:27:06,700
but I guess I didn't.

663
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,700
I put that in my mouth
and I was like...

664
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,067
Yeah.

665
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:13,900
It -- it's -- only --
I only taste butter.

666
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,367
This is a head-scratcher,
man.

667
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:22,933
**

668
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,567
Aditya!
Come on in, please.

669
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:26,800
-Hi.
-Hi.

670
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,333
My BFF was blueberry.

671
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:29,533
Awesome.

672
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:31,933
I made a round lemon bar
with blueberry coulis

673
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,167
and oatmeal crumble.

674
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:35,567
Do I have to --
where is your lemon decoration?

675
00:27:35,567 --> 00:27:37,233
VALERIE: I don't have
a lemon decoration.

676
00:27:37,233 --> 00:27:39,133
I thought it was supposed
to be on there.

677
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:40,467
-Oh, that's all right.
-That's a lemon.

678
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:43,933
-Yeah.
-That's your lemon decoration?

679
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,167
So, if I took a big old bite
out of that,

680
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:48,267
how do you think
I'd feel?

681
00:27:48,267 --> 00:27:50,467
Well, it is edible.

682
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:54,133
Well, technically,
it looks like a lemon,

683
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,700
and it's edible.

684
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,933
It still meets the guidelines
of the twist

685
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,667
even though it is stupid.

686
00:28:00,667 --> 00:28:03,233
This is an absolutely
gorgeous plate.

687
00:28:03,233 --> 00:28:05,700
I love what you did with
the blueberry coulis,

688
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,800
and I even like
the little bit of crumble

689
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,100
that's on the side.

690
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,767
Yeah, I think the flowers
is a great idea.

691
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,067
You know, it looks really,
really beautiful.

692
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:17,567
The lemon is
so nice and tart.

693
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:20,333
It goes so well with
the blueberry coulis,

694
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,433
it kind of adds
that little extra bit

695
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,933
of tartness
and sweetness.

696
00:28:22,933 --> 00:28:24,867
The cookie is fantastic.

697
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:26,600
See how flaky
the cookie is?

698
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,200
You've got this, like, really
good, strong lemon flavor

699
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,633
that's just
kind of wrapped into

700
00:28:30,633 --> 00:28:33,300
velvety blueberriness
of your sauce.

701
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,833
it's really good, man.

702
00:28:34,833 --> 00:28:36,167
My lemon bars are gonna
have to come

703
00:28:36,167 --> 00:28:37,833
with some blueberry
coulis from now on.

704
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:39,267
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

705
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:41,900
-Thanks, Aditya.
-Thank you. Bye.

706
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,833
-Wow.
-Very impressive.

707
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,067
Is it in my beard?

708
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:46,167
No, you're good.

709
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:49,067
Thanks.

710
00:28:49,067 --> 00:28:50,533
Luke.

711
00:28:50,533 --> 00:28:54,267
Today, I've made for you
a lemon bar with blackberries

712
00:28:54,267 --> 00:28:56,433
and a blackberry coulis.

713
00:28:56,433 --> 00:29:00,900
Please tell me about
your lemon decoration.

714
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:06,800
That is a rice cereal treat
with yellow coating chocolate

715
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,700
and a little green fondant leaf.

716
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,467
He even made the leaf.

717
00:29:10,467 --> 00:29:12,567
I think your chocolate
was too cold.

718
00:29:12,567 --> 00:29:13,433
You know?

719
00:29:13,433 --> 00:29:14,767
So, if the chocolate
was a little warmer,

720
00:29:14,767 --> 00:29:16,700
it would have leveled
back into itself,

721
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:19,333
and you probably would
have had a smoother lemon.

722
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:20,933
Let's taste it --
Ooh!

723
00:29:20,933 --> 00:29:22,133
-I heard that.
-Yeah.

724
00:29:22,133 --> 00:29:24,667
**

725
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:26,767
Boy, do I love
the lemon flavor in here.

726
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:28,067
It's nice and bright,

727
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,233
just the perfect amount
of sweetness.

728
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:31,533
But there's something
interesting happening

729
00:29:31,533 --> 00:29:32,867
in the bar.

730
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:35,133
It's like the lemon curd
went right into the crust.

731
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:39,067
So, it's like
a juicy lemon cookie.

732
00:29:39,067 --> 00:29:41,200
-Luke, it's delicious.
-Mm-hmm.

733
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,433
I think what happened was

734
00:29:42,433 --> 00:29:44,167
your crust was
still pretty warm,

735
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,633
it inhaled
the lemon curd.

736
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:51,700
I did not mean for it
to be like that.

737
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,967
I'll just get a little...

738
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,133
Such a girl.

739
00:29:55,133 --> 00:29:57,967
**

740
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:00,200
I can't close my mouth.

741
00:30:02,267 --> 00:30:04,633
-It's really delicious.
-Thanks, man.

742
00:30:04,633 --> 00:30:06,067
Thank you.

743
00:30:06,067 --> 00:30:07,300
Yeah,
I wouldn't call it a bar.

744
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,633
I think
juicy lemon cookie.

745
00:30:08,633 --> 00:30:10,500
-Juicy lemon cookie.
-Juicy lemon cookie.

746
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,967
That would be
a good band name.

747
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:14,100
"We're the Juicy
Lemon Cookies!

748
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,200
Good night, Cleveland!"

749
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,233
Julia.

750
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:21,733
I got cherry
for the ingredient.

751
00:30:21,733 --> 00:30:23,600
It looks like you mixed them in
with your lemon curd?

752
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,900
Yes.

753
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,867
You want to tell me
about your lemon decoration?

754
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,367
I made a candied
lemon decoration.

755
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,700
It's edible
if it's candy.

756
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,167
I like how you used the juice
in the filling

757
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,600
and made it pink.

758
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,633
It's really cool,
it's a great idea.

759
00:30:39,633 --> 00:30:42,233
Let's taste it.

760
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:44,200
The lemon curd
tastes really good,

761
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,733
but here's the problem
with cherry juice.

762
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,167
Yeah?

763
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:48,833
It took away all
the tartness of the lemon.

764
00:30:48,833 --> 00:30:50,367
Oh, okay.

765
00:30:50,367 --> 00:30:52,967
So, I don't really taste cherry,
I just taste sugar.

766
00:30:52,967 --> 00:30:54,700
Okay.
Sorry, Valerie.

767
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,300
I know you like lemon.

768
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,833
All right,
I'm going for it.

769
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:01,367
-That's lemon.
-Yeah.

770
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:03,167
-Thanks.
-Thanks, Julia.

771
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:04,133
Thank you.

772
00:31:04,133 --> 00:31:11,633
**

773
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:15,100
-Hmm.
-Beverly, come on in!

774
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,533
Hey, Beverly, what's up?

775
00:31:16,533 --> 00:31:20,100
The ceiling!

776
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,600
I was supposed to make it
in a square,

777
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:27,067
and my BFF for my lemon
was walnuts.

778
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,700
Beverly,
what happened today?

779
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,067
When I tried to take
my lemon bars out of the pan,

780
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:35,633
it kind of went pbht.

781
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:37,700
It's very upsetting!

782
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,167
I mean, a whole part
of the challenge is missing.

783
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,333
It's not a bar.

784
00:31:46,533 --> 00:31:51,700
**

785
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,800
It's very upsetting!

786
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,233
I mean, a whole part
of the challenge is missing.

787
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:59,400
It's not a bar.

788
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
What did you do
for your lemon decoration?

789
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,967
For the lemon decoration,
I took a slice of lemon

790
00:32:03,967 --> 00:32:05,667
and covered it
in powdered sugar.

791
00:32:05,667 --> 00:32:07,067
Now it's a candy.

792
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:08,733
-Oh, really?
-Hmm.

793
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:11,333
**

794
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:14,533
That's just a raw lemon.

795
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,867
-Well, let's try it.
-Let's try it.

796
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:20,933
**

797
00:32:20,933 --> 00:32:24,667
It's...

798
00:32:24,667 --> 00:32:25,933
so delicious.

799
00:32:25,933 --> 00:32:27,133
Yay.

800
00:32:27,133 --> 00:32:28,833
It's, like, over-the-top
delicious.

801
00:32:28,833 --> 00:32:30,333
Yay.

802
00:32:30,333 --> 00:32:31,967
That lemon curd is creamy
and bright

803
00:32:31,967 --> 00:32:33,167
and lemony and tart

804
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:35,600
and just the perfect
amount of sweetness.

805
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,300
I can taste the crunch
of the walnuts.

806
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,767
It's so delicious!

807
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:43,800
Beverly, you got to work
on your time management.

808
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:47,933
Your lemon curd is so smooth,
it's so clean,

809
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:49,433
and you ran out of time,

810
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,800
and then
you have a cup of stuff.

811
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,400
This isn't a bar.
-I know.

812
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,700
-Thank you, though.
-Thanks, Beverly.

813
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,767
-Bye!
-Bye.

814
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,667
See you.
That was hard.

815
00:32:59,667 --> 00:33:01,267
-That was hard.
-That was hard.

816
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:03,067
'Cause this really
does taste delicious.

817
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:04,900
I know.
But this isn't a bar.

818
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:06,667
-No.
-It's a cup.

819
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,800
Mm-hmm.

820
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,467
#Time got the best of me today.

821

**

822
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,667
Abby.

823
00:33:13,667 --> 00:33:17,400
Today, I have made for you
a strawberry lemon bar

824
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,367
topped with a strawberry coulis

825
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:24,333
and a little strawberry
decoration thing.

826
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:26,433
Abby, I think your tray
is really cute,

827
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:28,233
and I think it's
kind of messy.

828
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,800
You spent all this time

829
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,400
on making these beautiful
strawberry fans,

830
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,267
but it would have been nice
to, like, line them up

831
00:33:35,267 --> 00:33:37,567
and show the beautiful
work you did.

832
00:33:37,567 --> 00:33:38,800
Yeah.

833
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,933
So, tell us about
your lemon decoration.

834
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:47,333
My lemon decoration is a
sugar cookie topped with icing.

835
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,900
You made a sugar cookie?

836
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,400
-Yes.
-Impressive.

837
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,100
-Extra.
-Yeah.

838
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,467
That's a cute
little cookie.

839
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:58,067
-Take a bite.
-It's your cookie.

840
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,600
It's your cookie.

841
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,133
I'm sure it's my cookie.

842
00:34:01,133 --> 00:34:03,900
**

843
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,667
Oh?
Oh?

844
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:06,900
That's a really
good sugar cookie.

845
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,167
Mmm.
Let's eat.

846
00:34:08,167 --> 00:34:10,267
Let's bite into this bar.

847
00:34:10,267 --> 00:34:13,900
Mmm.
Lemony!

848
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,067
-Ooh.
-That curd is fabulous.

849
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:19,067
But your crust is
really underbaked.

850
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,067
You know, if it was baked
a little bit longer,

851
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:21,433
it kind of --

852
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,067
you would have had
this nice, soft lemon curd,

853
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,567
and then a nice,
crunchy cookie.

854
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:27,533
And those two textures
are really good together.

855
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:28,933
-Thanks, Abby.
-Thanks, Abby.

856
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:29,933
Thank you.

857
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,167
**

858
00:34:33,167 --> 00:34:34,467
Alex, come on in.

859
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:37,800
**

860
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,367
Hi.
My lemon BFF was ginger.

861
00:34:40,367 --> 00:34:42,867
So, it's a ginger crust,
and then it's just

862
00:34:42,867 --> 00:34:44,367
a regular lemon curd filling,

863
00:34:44,367 --> 00:34:46,733
and then I topped it
with a ginger whipped cream.

864
00:34:46,733 --> 00:34:51,067
For the lemon twist,
I did a fondant lemon.

865
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:52,467
And it's
a beautiful lemon.

866
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:55,733
I love that you did
a slice of lemon.

867
00:34:55,733 --> 00:34:57,267
It's actually
quite pretty.

868
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,733
Wow, thank you.

869
00:34:58,733 --> 00:35:00,067
All right, well, Alex,

870
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,300
I think your tray
looks really nice.

871
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:02,700
-Thank you.
-I like your platter.

872
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,833
I like how there's some red,
and there's some yellow,

873
00:35:03,833 --> 00:35:05,533
and it looks really good.

874
00:35:05,533 --> 00:35:07,533
I'm gonna try and see
if I can taste your ginger

875
00:35:07,533 --> 00:35:08,967
in your whipped cream.
That was a great idea.

876
00:35:08,967 --> 00:35:10,933
Yeah.

877
00:35:10,933 --> 00:35:12,167
It is very gingery.

878
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:15,067
It's a beautiful,
subtle flavor.

879
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:17,467
Mmm!

880
00:35:17,467 --> 00:35:19,067
Mmm.

881
00:35:19,067 --> 00:35:22,733
That was a super
mellow lemon bar.

882
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:26,300
I do like that they're not
too overly sweet.

883
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,067
-Oh, okay.
-I love the consistency.

884
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:29,433
It's really nice.

885
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:32,167
You got a nice, clean curd,
it's not all broken up,

886
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:34,333
and I like your crust.

887
00:35:34,333 --> 00:35:36,300
It's nice when, you know,
you can sort of bite into it,

888
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,600
it's a little chewy.

889
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,100
It's kind of tender,
which is really nice.

890
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,867
-Yes!
-Thank you, Alex.

891
00:35:40,867 --> 00:35:42,800
-Thanks, Alex.
-Thank you. Bye.

892
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,100
-Bye-bye.
-See you.

893
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,067
-The curd.
-It's excellent.

894
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,900
This curd is perfect.

895
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,133
Soleil.

896
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:53,433
My lemon BFF was coconut.

897
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:58,133
My lemon decoration
is lemon buttercream.

898
00:35:58,133 --> 00:36:00,700
On our plate, they're
absolutely beautiful.

899
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,233
But you can see where it went
from good to bad to worse.

900
00:36:05,233 --> 00:36:07,600
Now, the buttercream
was an odd choice,

901
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,367
'cause I don't really know
what to do with it.

902
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:11,633
I don't really want to have
a fork-full of buttercream.

903
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:15,833
Mmm!

904
00:36:15,833 --> 00:36:18,600
I'm getting the lemon flavor
right off the bat.

905
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,633
Makes me
very, very happy.

906
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:22,667
Your cookie
is really nice.

907
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:25,300
It's super chewy,
not underbaked.

908
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,400
It's really good.
And your lemon curd.

909
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,233
-Thank you.
-It is perfect.

910
00:36:30,233 --> 00:36:31,300
It is delicious.

911
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,833
It's really nice.

912
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:36,067
But I am not getting
any coconut.

913
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:38,133
I can feel
the coconut texture,

914
00:36:38,133 --> 00:36:40,200
but I can't taste it.
Thank you.

915
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:42,600
-Thanks, Soleil.
-Thank you, bye.

916
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,367
No coconut?
I thought it was enough.

917
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:50,467
-Hi, Bryn.
-Hi!

918
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:54,633
Today I made an almond lemon bar
with chocolate ganache,

919
00:36:54,633 --> 00:36:57,600
then on the side is a rice
cereal crispy treat.

920
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,067
It looks like some of them
are diamonds, not all of them.

921
00:37:01,067 --> 00:37:03,233
I love that you
did a 3D lemon.

922
00:37:03,233 --> 00:37:05,433
I love this
big old baseball.

923
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,067
Now, the seam
is a little rough.

924
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:08,633
Yeah.

925
00:37:08,633 --> 00:37:09,700
What you could've done here

926
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,867
is taken, like,
a peeler, you know?

927
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,567
For like a carrot,
you know?

928
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:15,933
And you could've just kind of
shaved that down a little bit.

929
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:17,067
Here, half for you,
half for me.

930
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:18,600
All right.
Cheers.

931
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,067
Cheers.

932
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:23,067
Mmm!

933
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:24,300
Wow.

934
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,567
It's good.
Delicious.

935
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:27,133

this lemon bar.

delicious almond bar.

939
00:37:35,667 --> 00:37:36,867
Okay.

940
00:37:36,867 --> 00:37:38,100
I taste
no lemon whatsoever.

941
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,467
Okay.

942
00:37:39,467 --> 00:37:43,267

to happen at all.

Bryn, Bryn,
I thought we were tight?

945
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,700
You didn't give me
a lemon bar.

946
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:53,167
Okay, Bryn,
I think this is delicious.

947
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:56,267
I think it's -- you can
definitely taste the almonds.

948
00:37:56,267 --> 00:37:58,133
You know, the texture
is really nice,

949
00:37:58,133 --> 00:37:59,400
it's not dry at all.

950
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,500
And it's definitely
not a lemon bar.

951
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,067
-Thanks, Bryn.
-Thanks, Bryn.

952
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,767
Thank you.

what's gonna happen next.

-Where'd it go?

Bryn gave us a bar
that was delicious

970
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,467
and tasted like almonds.

971
00:38:52,467 --> 00:38:54,600
-What a yummy almond bar.
-Yeah.

972
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,667
-Not a bit of lemon.
-Nope.

973
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,067
Beverly gave us a cup,

974
00:38:58,067 --> 00:39:00,167
but it actually
tasted like lemon.

975
00:39:00,167 --> 00:39:02,300
The most delicious
lemon trifle

976
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,567
I have probably ever had.
-Sure.

977
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,133
All three of them didn't
complete the challenge

in different ways.

979
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,733
We have to make a decision,
and for me,

980
00:39:09,733 --> 00:39:12,067
that decision is gonna be
whether I want to eat

981

three bars again.

over my lemon obsession,

thank you.

985
00:39:25,167 --> 00:39:26,800
How about no more
lemon desserts?

986
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,333
-Yes.
-Good.

987
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,900
In this challenge,
three of you were the zest --

988

excuse me -- the best.
-Ha.

989
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:37,400
Aditya, your lemon
blueberry bars were gorgeous.

990
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,800
The curd was smooth,
the crust was flaky,

991
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,067
and you inspired me

992
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:43,067
with the way you handled
the blueberry.

993
00:39:43,067 --> 00:39:44,600

DUFF: Your lemon ginger bars
were mellow and delicious.

996
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,733
We really liked
the consistency

997
00:39:52,733 --> 00:39:54,967
and subtle flavor
of your lemon curd,

998
00:39:54,967 --> 00:39:55,833
and the ginger in your
whipped cream

999
00:39:55,833 --> 00:39:57,067
was a smart move.

1000
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:58,967
Oh, my God, really, what?
Thank you.

Your lemon bars with pecan
shortbread crust

1004
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,667
were presented
elegantly.

1005
00:40:06,667 --> 00:40:09,567
We were impressed, especially
with the cookie crust.

00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:10,767
Thank you.

1007
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:12,500
I've never been in the top
three before,

1008
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,033
and it's such a great feeling.

1009

But only one of you
should pucker up

you didn't create
a lemon bar.

00:41:19,767 --> 00:41:22,567
You made a lemon trifle.

1036
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:25,667
Bryn, you also didn't
make a lemon bar --

1037

you made an almond bar
with no lemon flavor.

A drip cake is
a regular cake,

37
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:35,567
but you take ganache and
drip some of the ganache over

38

dripping effect.

Sometimes, you can have
an ice cream cone,

you don't have to.

to make ice-cream cone
drip cakes.

00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:51,367
And your cakes will be inspired
by a classic ice-cream flavor,

00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:55,067
like mint chocolate chip
or Neapolitan.

one of these ice-cream cones.

about this cake is that --

not my only concern, I have
so many concerns, never mind.

64
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,300
There's only
peppermint extract.

65
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,767
Do you think that
would work?

66
00:02:49,767 --> 00:02:53,233
Yeah. Peppermint and mint are
like the same thing, I think.

67
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:55,333
They both have
the word "mint" in them.

68
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:56,500
That's a lot of sugar.

69
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,700
To make my cake,
I creamed together my butter,

00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,233
shortening, and sugar.

71
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:04,367
Then, I whisked together my
flour, salt, and baking powder.

72
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:07,400
Then, I added my flour mixture
and milk, alternating as I go.

73
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,800
And then, I add my eggs,
one at a time.

74
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,333
To get the mint flavor
in my cake,

75
00:03:11,333 --> 00:03:14,867
I'm just using peppermint
extract, and then dye it green.

76
00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:16,867
There's a lot of pressure
riding on this drip cake

77
00:03:16,867 --> 00:03:19,233
because last week,
I was in the top three,

78
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,700

to keep up with that.

00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,067
being able to get our cakes
in the oven quick enough,

91
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,400
but I'm the queen
of fast batter.

92
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:07,300
On the dot.
I am good.

93
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,833
I'm nervous
about pistachio

94
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:13,100
cause I have never had
pistachio, ever.

95
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,167
So, I have no idea
what it tastes like.

96
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:22,100
I'm making a pistachio cake
with a pistachio buttercream.

97
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,267
These are delicious.

98
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,167
You just ate
a pistachio.

99
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,433
Yeah.

100
00:04:28,433 --> 00:04:30,767
If you had to describe
the flavor of a pistachio,

101
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:32,333
what would you say?

102
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:37,867
It's nutty,
and it's kind of sweet.

103
00:04:37,867 --> 00:04:40,700
And sweet. It tastes like
a Mediterranean peanut.

104
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,300
I don't know.

105
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,933
[ Laughs ]

106
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:44,933
All right.
Good luck.

107
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:48,267
-Thank you!
-Pistachio palooza.

108
00:04:48,267 --> 00:04:53,433
I substituted 1 cup of flour
for 1 cup of ground pistachios

109
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:56,633
so that way, there isn't
too many dry ingredients.

110
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:59,067
Whoa, that is a lot
of batter.

111
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:03,467
I'm adding in my food coloring,
and it looks perfect.

112
00:05:03,467 --> 00:05:06,100
Well, Duff, they say
you can't buy happiness,

113
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,433
but you can buy
ice cream.

114
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:08,633
What's your favorite?

115
00:05:08,633 --> 00:05:12,167
My favorite ice cream is
peanut butter and chocolate.

116
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,633
ADITYA: The flavor I get is
chocolate peanut butter.

117
00:05:14,633 --> 00:05:17,267
I like chocolate, but, you know,
I'm not, like,

118
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,067
a choco-holic
or anything.

119
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:22,067
I'm making a chocolate drip cake
with peanut butter buttercream.

120
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:25,067
First, I add the dry ingredients
to the wet ingredients.

121
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:27,200
Then, I add
some peanut butter chips,

122
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,600
just to give it a little bit
of peanut butter flavor.

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,967
And lastly, I add the hot water
which blooms or,

124
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:35,133
like, intensifies
the chocolate.

125
00:05:35,133 --> 00:05:37,433
Some people also do this
with coffee,

126
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,733
but hot water also works.

127
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,400
Going into the oven!

128
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,833
And now, I can finally
get started on my buttercream.

129
00:05:46,767 --> 00:05:48,633
How's it going, bakers?

130
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:49,867
Good!

131
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:51,733
I got chocolate chip.

132
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:53,167
Yay!

133
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:55,933
Let me put my giant block
of butter.

134
00:05:55,933 --> 00:05:58,900
I like chocolate chip
because it's my nanna's favorite

135
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,500
ice cream flavor.

136
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,667
My nanna, she's awesome!

137
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:07,833
I'm gonna put in 3/4 of a cup
'cause I don't want too much,

138
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,267
but I don't want
too little.

139
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,267
Yeah,
that's way too little.

140
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:13,800
I'm making a
chocolate-chip cake

141
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,167
with chocolate-chip
cream cheese frosting

142
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:18,800
and milk chocolate drips.

143
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,167
I really want to make sure
they taste chocolate chip.

144
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:26,100
I mean, that's the entire
challenge!

145
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:30,133
Is anybody in the oven?
-Almost.

146
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:33,100
ALEX:
I got rainbow sherbet.

147
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,733
This lime
smells delicious.

148
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:38,067
I think rainbow-sherbet cake
should be key lime cake,

149
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:40,900
orange curd, and raspberry
buttercream, because those are,

150
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,300
I think, the three main flavors
of rainbow sherbet.

151
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,267
This is a lot of
zesting, eh?

152
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:49,067
First, I get started on
my key lime cake.

153
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:51,100
I mix together
my dry ingredients

154
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,267
and my wet ingredients,

155
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:54,433
and then, I fold in
my whipped egg whites.

156
00:06:54,433 --> 00:06:56,133
Whenever I make
a citrus cake,

157
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,967
I always like to whip
my egg whites until soft peaks

158
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:02,967
'cause it makes a lighter
and airier cake.

159
00:07:02,967 --> 00:07:05,333
So, the next thing I do is,
I start my curd.

160
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:09,400
I whisk together sugar,
egg yolks, and orange juice.

161
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,867
All right.

162
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:14,100
I've accomplished quite a bit,
but I still have a lot to do.

163
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,800
What flavor
did you get?

164
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,500
Neapolitan.

165
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:23,333
With the Neapolitan ice cream,
I have to make chocolate,

166
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,367
vanilla,
and strawberry.

167
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm making a
chocolate-and-vanilla cake

168
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,667
with strawberry-buttercream
icing.

169
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,533
Gosh,
this stuff is strong.

170
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:35,100
For my chocolate
cake batter,

171
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,967
I saved half of
my vanilla cake batter,

172
00:07:37,967 --> 00:07:41,500
added cocoa powder,
more milk and more eggs,

173
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,933
so it's the same consistency
as the vanilla.

174
00:07:44,933 --> 00:07:46,200
Going in the oven!

175
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,500
Ugh. I forgot
the orange curd.

176
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,767
My curd is on the double-boiler,
and I see that it has scrambled.

177
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,067
I'm thinking, "Oh, my goodness,
what am I gonna do?"

178
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,700
This...this is not
gonna work.

179
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,167
I'm trashing my orange curd
because I do not want to serve

180
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:08,567
scrambled eggs
to Duff and Valerie.

181
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:10,333
That would just be
unappetizing.

182
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,900
So, now, I am stressed.

183
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,600
VALERIE:
One hour left, bakers.

184
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,600
We want some cool
ice-cream-cone drip cakes.

185
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,800
Still no.

186
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,733
Hey, Alex,
what happened?

187
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,300
Um, yeah, I was making
an orange curd,

188
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,600
but it ended up
scrambling.

189
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,400
I threw out my orange curd,
and this is really bad

190
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,533
because this is a main component
of my cake.

191
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:38,867
So, you threw it away?

192
00:08:38,867 --> 00:08:40,433
I just threw it out because
it would just not work.

193
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:41,933
Are you kidding me? You just,
like, threw out a whole --

194
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,800
and you're gonna start something
all over again?

195
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,800
Yeah.

196
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,833
I have to figure
something out

197
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,500
because this orange curd
took a while.

198
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,433
So, you've scrapped
the orange curd...

199
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,767
Yeah.
-...and now, you're going for...

200
00:08:51,767 --> 00:08:52,933
Orange buttercream.

201
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,267
-Well, good luck!
-Thank you.

202
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,333
I'm trying to accomplish
the three flavors

203
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,500
of the rainbow sherbet,

204
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,067
so I get started on
my orange buttercream.

205
00:09:01,967 --> 00:09:03,900
BEVERLY: Julia,
what are you making?

206
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,633
A raspberry- vanilla-swirl
cake...

207
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:10,333
-Awesome!
-...and then,
a vanilla buttercream.

208
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,567
JULIA: Two hours is not a lot
of time to make a cake

209
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:17,400
and have drips and have
an ice-cream cone on it.

210
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,600
When my batter is done,
I take some of it out

211
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,500
and put it in a medium bowl,
and I set that aside.

212
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,933
I slowly add in some raspberry
puree and red food dye,

213
00:09:29,933 --> 00:09:33,067
and then, I swirl that
into my cakes.

214
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:35,800
I'm just lucky that I keep
getting something pink

215
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,600
because that's
my signature color.

216
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,067
LUKE: So, I think of butter
pecan as, like, sweet pecans.

217
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:47,533
So, I'm gonna melt butterscotch,
add that into my cake,

218
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:51,133
and also add
chocolate pecans.

219
00:09:51,133 --> 00:09:54,700
My inspiration
is my dad.

220
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:58,067
He loves butter-pecan ice cream,
so we always have it

221
00:09:58,067 --> 00:10:00,100
in the freezer in our house,
but I never eat it

222
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,233
'cause it doesn't
look great.

223
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,967
Man, I can't believe I put
my ice cream down earlier,

224
00:10:04,967 --> 00:10:06,000
and now
I don't have any.

225
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,200
I'm super bummed.

226
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,333
VALERIE: Aw!

227
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,567
No!

228
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:11,100
-I think I have an idea.
-Really?

229
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,967
Mm-hmm. Bakers, may we have
your attention please?

230
00:10:14,967 --> 00:10:17,433
Dun, dun, dun.

231
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:19,133
I scream.

232
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:20,767
Duff screams.

233
00:10:20,767 --> 00:10:22,767
[ Screams ]

234
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,833
We all scream
for ice cream.

235
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,900
-Yes!
-Yes!

236
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,033
Yes!
I'm good at this.

237
00:10:29,033 --> 00:10:33,700
I love ice cream
this much.

238
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,233
For this twist, you must make
actual ice cream

239
00:10:37,233 --> 00:10:39,467
to serve
on the sides

240
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:42,000
of your ice-cream-cone
drip cake.

241
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,500
Fill up my cone!

242
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:48,733
LINSEY: Abby's pretty happy, and
everyone else is pretty happy.

243
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:50,300
-Boo-yah!
-I am not happy.

244
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,533
I don't want
to make ice cream.

245
00:10:51,533 --> 00:10:52,633
Stay calm.

246
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:55,967
It's just so inconvenient
at the moment.

247
00:10:55,967 --> 00:10:59,733
Okay, let's just start
making ice cream.

248
00:10:59,733 --> 00:11:01,867
While I'm making
my Swiss meringue buttercream,

249
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:04,967
I also need to get started
on my ice cream.

250
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:07,367
While I'm trying to add
the butter to my buttercream,

251
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:09,333
I also need to try to make
a crème anglaise,

252
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:11,200
which is an
ice-cream base,

253
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,967
so I'm kind of two places
at once, and it's crazy.

254
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:16,833
I am multi-tasking
right now.

255
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:19,767
This is so...hard.

256
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:23,633
ABBY:
Mmm, perfect.

257
00:11:23,633 --> 00:11:28,100
I love ice cream so much because
I'm from the dairy state,

258
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,833
Wisconsin.

259
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,567
Abby is whisking
and whisking.

260
00:11:32,567 --> 00:11:34,533
She is whisking away
at her ice cream.

261
00:11:34,533 --> 00:11:38,167
Got the baking guns
right here,

262
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:42,233
but I don't really know
how to make pistachio ice cream,

263
00:11:42,233 --> 00:11:44,800
so, I think,
if I just make a classic vanilla

264
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,500
and add in
some toasted pistachios,

265
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,500
that will make the judges
really happy.

266
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,533
BEVERLY: Now, let me
whisk it up together.

267
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,300
I'm making
chocolate-chip ice cream.

268
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:56,800
Keep whisking!

269
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,900
I'm rushing a little to be the
first one in the ice cream maker

270
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,267
because there's only
two of them.

271
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:03,867
Oh, no, no, no.

272
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:06,733
Uh-oh. Beverly's cream for
her ice cream is boiling oven,

273
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,867
and that is not good.

274
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:10,300
Stop.

275
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,533
Go off.

276
00:12:11,533 --> 00:12:13,067
Ugh! It boiled over.

277
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,400
The thing
with cream is, like,

278
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,400
you can't let it just sit there
and cook and cook and boil.

279
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
You heat it up.

280
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,633
As soon as it goes...

281
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:20,667
and starts coming up
and it's about to boil,

282
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:21,833
you take it off.
-Uh-huh.

283
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,600
And then, you start tempering it
into your egg.

284
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,767
I think I can save it.

285
00:12:24,767 --> 00:12:26,567
I stir it,
and I turn the heat down,

286
00:12:26,567 --> 00:12:27,767
and it goes back
to normal.

287
00:12:27,767 --> 00:12:29,200
It's just a
little bit foamy.

288
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,100
So, I temper my eggs and get
that into the ice cream maker.

289
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,533
I just hope that
it doesn't, like, over-churn

290
00:12:35,533 --> 00:12:37,067
or anything bad
happen to it.

291
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:38,067
Ah!

292
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,300
Duff, what is going on
with Beverly

293
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,900
and the
ice-cream machine?

294
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,400
I'm not sure.

295
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,633
That didn't work.

296
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:46,167
Bryn, what's your favorite type
of ice cream?

297
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:48,400
Probably peanut butter.

298
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,567
Peanut butter, nice.

299
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,800
I love ice cream.

300
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,433
I love to eat it.

301
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:56,067
Not so much making it,
but I love to eat it.

302
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:58,867
I am making a vanilla-raspberry
ice cream.

303
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:02,467
So, to make my crème anglaise,
I combine half-and-half

304
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:05,067
and heavy cream, and then
I swirl vanilla bean

305
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,333
to infuse that milk
with that vanilla flavor.

306
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:11,233
So, slowly, I add my dairy while
I'm whisking like a mad man,

307
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,567
so I don't get any
scrambled eggs

308
00:13:12,567 --> 00:13:14,533
like I did in
my orange curd.

309
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:15,867
JULIA:
Looking good.

310
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,633
-How's everybody doing?
-Good.

311
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,167
I'm making a vanilla-raspberry
swirl ice cream

312
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,833
because I really want to stick
to the flavors.

313
00:13:26,833 --> 00:13:29,267
This is so cool.

314
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,267
SOLEIL: I'm making
cookies-and-cream ice cream,

315
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:33,133
and it's gonna be
the best one

316
00:13:33,133 --> 00:13:35,400
that Duff and Valerie
have ever had

317
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,133
because this ice cream maker is,
like, ginormous.

318
00:13:39,133 --> 00:13:41,333
If I win, I'm just gonna
buy one for my house

319
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,667
so I can make ice cream
whenever I want.

320
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:44,800
What's up, Bryn?

321
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,167
What?
Oh, hey!

322
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,167
"What"?

323
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:49,067
Is this
ice-cream base?

324
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,600
-Yes.
-Awesome.

325
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:55,633
I've made ice cream
around four times in my years.

326
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,233
Were you happy
with the twist?

327
00:13:57,233 --> 00:14:00,800
Um, I was okay about the twist,
but, you know,

328
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,933
y'all give us stuff, and we just
got to do it sometime.

329
00:14:03,933 --> 00:14:07,133
So, I'm over here
slaving away.

[ Laughs ]

331
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,200
I'm gonna make
a vanilla ice cream

332
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,633
with fresh-cut
strawberries in it

333
00:14:14,633 --> 00:14:18,600
because it'll match
my Neapolitan ice-cream flavor.

334
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,300
Take it off.
Take it off.

335
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,067
I don't want to rush because
there's a really high chance

336
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,967
that you can
curdle your eggs,

337
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:29,433
and then, you have to start
all oven again.

338
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:30,433
Oh, no!

339
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:33,633
There's so much egg
that got cooked.

340
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:35,233
I don't have time
for this.

341
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:38,833
I started pouring out my crème
anglaise into a little strainer,

342
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:43,067
and I noticed that the eggs
got so scrambled.

343
00:14:43,067 --> 00:14:47,067
And then, I take my cakes
out of the blast chiller...

344
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,400
Shoot.

345
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,067
...and it breaks right in half
when I try and flip it

346
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,133
to the right side.

347
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:53,433
And then,
as I'm leveling the cake...

348
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:55,300
Ooh, I cut my hand.

349
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,767
...everything just went wrong
at the same time --

350
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:01,367
everything, except for
my buttercream.

351
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:04,067
Thank you, buttercream.

352
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:07,167
It looks like Linsey's having
a bit of a meltdown.

00:15:07,167 --> 00:15:09,333
Yeah.

354
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:10,933
My finger hurts.

355
00:15:10,933 --> 00:15:12,533

LUKE: I'm really happy
about the twist.

00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,900
I'm gonna make
a peach ice cream.

358
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,633
I'm not gonna do
a crème anglaise

359
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:24,667
because that takes
a little bit more time,

360
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:28,433
and we're on
a time limit here.

361
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:32,067
I mix together heavy cream,
milk, and sugar.

362
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,433
Then, I add in a little bit
of vanilla extract.

363
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:36,700
In my blender,
I throw in peaches,

364
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,567
and then a little bit of cream,
and that's it.

365
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,433
It's that simple.

366
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,600
-Wait, you're already done?
-Yeah.

367
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm just going make
a chocolate ice cream base

368
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,700
and sprinkle some peanut butter
chips throughout that.

369
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:52,967
I spill some of my crème
anglaise on myself and, like,

370
00:15:52,967 --> 00:15:57,200
all over the place, so I guess
it's just, like, a messy day.

371
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,500
Hot!

SOLEIL: I'm seeing everyone else
pull out their cakes,

373
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,600
and I'm thinking, "I really need
to go check on mine

374
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,767
because I don't want it
to be over-baked."

375
00:16:07,767 --> 00:16:10,133
Oh, that's so not done.

376
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:14,533
But I look and see
it's the complete opposite.

377
00:16:14,533 --> 00:16:16,200
That's wonderful.

378
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,067
It is literally raw.

379
00:16:24,133 --> 00:16:25,133
Okay.

380
00:16:25,133 --> 00:16:26,533
I'm getting a little bit
nervous.

381
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:29,733
I think my cakes are raw because
I added way too much batter

382
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:30,733
to my cake pan.

383
00:16:30,733 --> 00:16:32,800
Duff, check out Soleil.

00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,267
This one
looks even worse.

385
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:37,967
I just cut the tops
off of my cakes

386
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,500
so that it will
bake quicker.

387
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,233
That is a really risky maneuver,
but she has to do it.

388
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:44,967
I can't really serve underbaked
cake to Duff and Valerie

389
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:47,067
'cause then they can't really
eat it, even.

put this back in.

my decorating time.

more raspberry.

And I add some
raspberry puree

00:17:04,967 --> 00:17:06,967
because that will make
my frosting

398
00:17:06,967 --> 00:17:09,533
a raspberry color
and taste.

I wish this were
real ice cream.

And then, I need to get started
on my ice-cream cone.

I want my frosting
to harden a little bit

I make my

by doing three parts white
chocolate, one part cream.

Then, I grab yellow food dye
and color it yellow

goes well with brown.

The key is, make your drips
not too thin, not too thick,

449
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:24,233

cool enough

make the frosting drip, as well.

00:26:07,533 --> 00:26:10,867
But blue is my favorite color,
so I guess that's why I did it.

608
00:26:10,867 --> 00:26:14,100
For drip cakes, you want a
ganache that's thick enough

609
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,433
that it will not go all the way
to the board, like this one did.

610
00:26:18,433 --> 00:26:22,233
It looks like, here,
your ganache was just too thin.

611
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,267
Okay.

612
00:26:23,267 --> 00:26:24,733
And tell us about
your ice cream.

613
00:26:24,733 --> 00:26:27,500
I made a chocolate-peanut-butter
ice cream.

614
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,367
That looks like
chocolate peanut butter.

615
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:31,467
Mmm.

616
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:34,700
Nice, smooth
consistency.

617
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,133
Your ice cream
is really good,

618
00:26:36,133 --> 00:26:37,400
you know,
it's really smooth.

619
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,200
It's really chocolate-y.
It's nice.

620
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,067
That's peanut butter
chocolate chip.

621
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:46,533
My mind is boggled
about this green.

622
00:26:46,533 --> 00:26:49,967
Yeah. I mean, it really looks
like chocolate mint, now.

623
00:26:49,967 --> 00:26:51,367
Yeah,
that's chocolate mint.

624
00:26:51,367 --> 00:26:57,600
**

625
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,233
Dude!

626
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:04,133
That is such a moist
chocolate cake.

627
00:27:04,133 --> 00:27:05,500
It is so yummy.

628
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,733
It is moist.

629
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:08,100
It is chocolate-y.

630
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,533
The buttercream
is peanut-buttery.

631
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:14,300
I just closed my eyes.
But the inside -- you nailed it.

632
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,533
Golly,
did you nail it --

633
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,067
except for the peanut butter
and the green.

634
00:27:19,067 --> 00:27:20,900
It's like,
"No, no, no, no."

635
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:23,267
Never, ever do that again
with your chocolate cake.

636
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,067
-Okay.
-Thank you.

637
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,067
-Goodbye.
-Thanks.

638
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,500
-Okay, bye.
-See you.

639
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,500
ADITYA: I'm half-thinking that
I could be going home right now,

640
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,467
but the other half of me
is thinking, like,

641
00:27:33,467 --> 00:27:34,667
"You'll be fine."

642
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,467
-Soleil...
-Hi.

643
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,900
-Hi!
-How's it going?

644
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,100
I'm good.

645
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,433
I got
cookies and cream.

646
00:27:43,433 --> 00:27:46,567
So, I made
cookies-and-cream cake

647
00:27:46,567 --> 00:27:49,133
with cookies-and-cream
frosting

648
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:52,800
and a hot-pink
chocolate drizzle.

649
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,300
I don't know if this is
a successful drip cake.

650
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,867
It is a cake.
-Yeah.

651
00:27:56,867 --> 00:27:58,933
And there are definitely
drips on it.

652
00:27:58,933 --> 00:28:03,667
But I don't think you controlled
the drips like you wanted to.

653
00:28:03,667 --> 00:28:05,267
No.

654
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,633
Not really.

655
00:28:06,633 --> 00:28:07,633
All right.
Let's cut this thing.

656
00:28:07,633 --> 00:28:09,133
Let's cut it.

657
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:12,233
Oh, I'm getting through
all the cookies.

658
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,967
Wow.

659
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:16,233
That's a lot of sugar
on top.

660
00:28:16,233 --> 00:28:20,067
I'm gonna avoid the layer
of sugar on the top.

661
00:28:20,067 --> 00:28:23,367
I think that might be
a good idea.

662
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:28,300
Soleil, that's a really
fabulously moist cake.

663
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,733
Thank you.

664
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:35,433
Your buttercream is cookies and
cream, no doubt about it, good.

665
00:28:35,433 --> 00:28:44,067
Your cake, though, while good,
I believe, was over-mixed.

666
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,067
What about
your ice cream?

667
00:28:45,067 --> 00:28:48,400
Cookies-and-cream
ice cream.

668
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:52,267
That looks like real, real
cookies-and-cream ice cream.

669
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:54,900
Mm-hmm.

670
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,867
Tastes like it, too.

671
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,400
That is a really good
cookies-and-cream ice cream.

672
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,367
-Wow.
-Thank you.

673
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:02,833
All right. Well,
look, you know,

674
00:29:02,833 --> 00:29:05,767
things taste pretty good,
but -- cake.

675
00:29:05,767 --> 00:29:07,433
I think the cake
is very moist.

676
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,833
I'm more disappointed
in your decorations.

677
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,233
I know you can
do better,

678
00:29:11,233 --> 00:29:16,100
and this is really not the mess
that I expect from you.

679
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Thank you.

680
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,933
-Thank you.
-See you, Soleil.

681
00:29:18,933 --> 00:29:20,300
Bye.

682
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,633
Linsey. Tell us
what you got today,

683
00:29:22,633 --> 00:29:24,233
and tell us how
your day went.

684
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:26,700
So, today,
I got mint chip.

685
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,600
I made for you
a mint-chocolate-chip cake

686
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,100
with a Swiss-meringue
buttercream

687
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,933
and a chocolate-ganache
drip topping.

688
00:29:33,933 --> 00:29:34,933
You made
a Swiss meringue?

689
00:29:34,933 --> 00:29:36,233
-Yeah.
-Wow.

690
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,567
Awesome.

691
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,400
I'm wondering
about your cake here

692
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,533
'cause it's not
Linsey-themed.

693
00:29:41,533 --> 00:29:44,567
It's a bit messy.

694
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:50,067
Well, the cake kind of broke
into, like, a bunch of pieces.

695
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:51,467
Oh, are you kidding me?

696
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,833
So, I just, like, tried to
stick it back -- sorry.

697
00:29:54,833 --> 00:29:56,667
Ugh.
Okay.

698
00:29:56,667 --> 00:29:59,233
It's okay.
It's okay.

699
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:02,500
So, I just tried to stick it
back together the best I could.

700
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,600
Are you okay?

701
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,633
Yeah.

702
00:30:06,533 --> 00:30:08,900
What's going on
with you right now?

703
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:14,767
It just, like, everything kind
of fell apart at the same time,

704
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,267
and it was just a little hard to
piece everything back together.

705
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:21,867
The more words that come out,
the more water coming out, too.

706
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:25,033
I'm just preparing myself
for the worst right now.

707
00:30:30,733 --> 00:30:33,233
I was just not thinking
about my cake,

708
00:30:33,233 --> 00:30:35,133
and just remembering
all the bad things.

709
00:30:35,133 --> 00:30:36,700
I don't have time
for this.

710
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,600
And having to say it
to Duff and Valerie

711
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,200
just put all these things
in my head.

712
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,867
I definitely think you're being
a little too hard on yourself,

713
00:30:42,867 --> 00:30:44,267
because your cake
is round.

714
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,433
VALERIE: Yeah.

715
00:30:45,433 --> 00:30:46,567
So, it's all right.

716
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:49,867
I have a finished cake
in front of me.

717
00:30:49,867 --> 00:30:52,067
It's just a messy cake.

718
00:30:52,067 --> 00:30:53,400
Let's taste it.
-All right.

719
00:30:57,633 --> 00:30:59,767
You've got mint in your
buttercream and in your cake?

720
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:01,267
Well, just in my cake.

721
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:03,100
Oh. That's a lot
of mint flavor.

722
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,500
Mm-hmm.

723
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,067
It definitely tastes like
mint-chocolate-chip ice cream.

724
00:31:07,067 --> 00:31:09,300
That much on the verge
of putting too much mint in,

725
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,700
but I love it.

726
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:14,900
-Okay.
-And you use a nice
dark chocolate.

727
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:16,167
What about
your ice cream?

728
00:31:16,167 --> 00:31:19,400
I also made a
mint-chocolate-chip ice cream.

729
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,800
I want to eat
this ice cream.

730
00:31:24,667 --> 00:31:26,133
It's minty.

731
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:30,233
It's chocolaty, not particularly
creamy, like ice cream, though.

732
00:31:30,233 --> 00:31:31,233
Okay.

733
00:31:31,233 --> 00:31:32,567
Linsey, go breathe.

734
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,067
All right.

735
00:31:34,067 --> 00:31:38,367
So embarrassed.

736
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,767
-Luke.
-Hello.

737
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,833
-How's it going?
-Good.

738
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,400
So, tell us about the flavor
of ice cream that you picked.

739
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,633
Butter pecan.

740
00:31:45,633 --> 00:31:47,867
Interesting. So, what kind
of cake did you make us?

741
00:31:47,867 --> 00:31:52,333
A butter-pecan cake with
vanilla butter-cream frosting

742
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,533
and a white-chocolate drip.

743
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:57,333
Is there supposed to be, like,
a moosh of ice cream?

744
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:00,633
Yeah.
I think it melted.

745
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:03,367
I think your cake was
a little bit on the warm side

746
00:32:03,367 --> 00:32:04,400
when you put
the buttercream on.

747
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,433
This almost looks like
your crumb coat.

748
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:10,067
Let's dig into this.

749
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:11,900
The pecans
are coming through.

750
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,233
The buttercream isn't
overly sweet, which I like.

751
00:32:15,233 --> 00:32:16,567
Luke, I taste it.

752
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,167
Yeah, I really taste
butter pecan.

753
00:32:18,167 --> 00:32:21,267
I think you could have gotten
some more pecan flavor.

754
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:25,533
Whenever you're working with
nuts, toast them, always.

755
00:32:25,533 --> 00:32:27,067
And tell us about
your ice cream.

756
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,867
LUKE: I made a peach
ice cream.

757
00:32:29,867 --> 00:32:33,733
Peach ice cream
with butter pecan?

758
00:32:33,733 --> 00:32:36,100
Are you working for the state
of Georgia, by any chance?

759
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,967
No.

760
00:32:37,967 --> 00:32:39,467
I don't know
what that means.

761
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:42,900
Well, it's an
interesting duo.

762
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,133
Good ice cream.

763
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:46,533
It's nice and smooth,
but I'm not getting any peaches.

764
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,533
The only peach I'm getting
is that piece that's in there.

765
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,700
-Okay.
-Thanks, Luke.

766
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,433
Thank you.

767
00:32:52,433 --> 00:32:53,767
Hi, Beverly.

768
00:32:53,767 --> 00:32:55,267
BEVERLY: Hello.

769
00:32:55,267 --> 00:32:57,500
You don't have as big a smile
on your face as you usually do.

770
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,500
What's going on?

771
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,933
My ice cream melted.

772
00:33:00,933 --> 00:33:03,567
It wouldn't firm up.

773
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:06,067
So, tell us
what flavor you got.

774
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,300
I got the chocolate-chip
ice cream.

775
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,700
I have made a vanilla cake
with chocolate chips in it,

776
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:16,533
a crushed-up
chocolate-chip buttercream,

777
00:33:16,533 --> 00:33:21,433
and chocolate drips,
and a chocolate-chip ice cream.

778
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,967
The ganache is obviously
a little thin

779
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:27,500
'cause there's a lot of drips on
your cake board.

780
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,133
Why did you choose
the orange?

781
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:32,467
Orange is my favorite color.
And it reminds me of my cat,

782
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:34,767
my snake, and my goldfish
that I won at the carnival

783
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,767

in that.

I'm getting chocolate-chip
ice cream, though.

Yay.

787
00:33:44,167 --> 00:33:45,800
It's a little on
the dry side.

788
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,100

she made a sauce.

Uh-oh.

792
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,433
The ice cream
is delicious.

793
00:33:57,433 --> 00:33:59,333
Well, I should say
the ice cream...

794
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:01,633
-Soup is delicious.
-...the soup is delicious.

795
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:03,933
It's tasty,
but it's not ice cream.

796
00:34:03,933 --> 00:34:05,467
-Yeah.
-It's crème anglaise.

797
00:34:05,467 --> 00:34:09,800
-Yeah.
-And it's really sweet.

798
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,200

Mm-hmm.

807
00:34:26,767 --> 00:34:30,967
I made a vanilla swirl
with raspberry cake

808
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:33,367
and then,
a vanilla buttercream,

809
00:34:33,367 --> 00:34:37,467
And for the ice-cream cone,
I did a raspberry buttercream.

810
00:34:37,467 --> 00:34:39,100
-Oh, okay.
-Cool.

811
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,300
I'm a little worried
about coating chocolate

812
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:44,333
on top of the cake, but it did
make for a beautiful color.

813
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:45,400
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

814
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,133
But it's not gonna taste
like raspberry.

815
00:34:47,133 --> 00:34:48,700
Okay.

816
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:51,367
That's dark.

817
00:34:51,367 --> 00:34:52,667
Just a little dark.

818
00:34:52,667 --> 00:34:54,733
Yeah, like, I cut that off
in the second layer.

819
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:56,067
I didn't do it
to the first.

820
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:57,067

moist cake.

I'm not getting
a lot of raspberry.

824
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,433
Yeah.

825
00:35:09,433 --> 00:35:11,833
Much more of that raspberry
swirl needs to be in there.

826
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:13,433
Yeah, more raspberry.

827
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:15,600
It's a delicious
cake, though.

828
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
Yay.

829

All right, Julia,
tell us about your ice cream.

830
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,533
I made a vanilla ice cream,

831
00:35:20,533 --> 00:35:22,933
and then,
I swirled in raspberry puree.

832
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:28,867
It's not too sweet, which I
really, really appreciate.

833
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:29,967
Thank you.

a little bit more.

Hey, Alex.

849
00:35:56,267 --> 00:35:58,600
Okay, so,
I got rainbow sherbert,

850
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,500
and I made a key-lime cake
with a raspberry

851
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,200
and an orange frosting.

852
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,067
Yeah, I guess rainbow sherbert
is, you know,

853
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:07,700
kind of bright,
kind of acidic.

854
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:11,067
Okay.
Is is rainbowy?

went with your crumb coat.

ice a cake?

Even though I know
this is not your best work,

864
00:36:28,167 --> 00:36:30,667
I can tell you know
how to ice a cake,

865
00:36:30,667 --> 00:36:33,400
because this is
a crumb coat.

866
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,700
-Ouch.
-But how does it taste,
I wonder?

I know that Duff
doesn't like food coloring,

870
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,800
but just a little bit
of food coloring,

871
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,400
just so it looked
like lime.

872
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:45,800
Here, you could
definitely get away with
a little food coloring.

873
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,467
Why didn't I
think of that?

874
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:51,267
It's a tiny bit
overbaked.

more than anything.

and some yellow sprinkles

882

making the cake way too thick.

00:40:21,233 --> 00:40:22,500
-Good job.
-Yes.

954
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,633
...Aditya...

955
00:40:25,633 --> 00:40:28,800
...Luke...

956
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,200
...Linsey...

957
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,267
Oh, I won.
Thank you.

958
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:35,267
DUFF:
...and...

959
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,533
Julia.

960
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,467
-Good job.
-Good job.

961
00:40:38,467 --> 00:40:40,900
You're all safe.

962
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:46,033
Unfortunately, that leaves
Soleil, Alex, and Beverly.

963
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,167
Please step forward.

964
00:40:48,167 --> 00:40:49,233
Not again.

965
00:40:49,233 --> 00:40:50,567
ALEX: Throughout
this whole competition,

966
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,000
I'm like
a roller coaster.

967
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,000
Week 4,
I'm on the bottom again.

968
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,967
This is not good.

969
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:58,033
We're all great bakers,
don't forget that.

970
00:40:58,033 --> 00:41:00,067
I agree.

971
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:03,200
All three of you
took this challenge head on,

972
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,933
but each of you made mistakes
we just couldn't overlook.

973
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:10,400
Soleil, your cookies-and-cream
cake was over-mixed,

974
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,400
and the whole thing
was really messy.

975
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,500
And for some reason,
you tried to fix it

976
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,433
with a pound
of sanding sugar.

977
00:41:18,433 --> 00:41:22,067
DUFF:
Beverly, the ganache on your
chocolate-chip cake was thin,

978
00:41:22,067 --> 00:41:24,733
and the cake itself
was dry.

979
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:27,833
And the thing is, this was a
cake and ice-cream challenge,

980
00:41:27,833 --> 00:41:29,767
and your ice cream
was soup.

981
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,633
Yeah.

982
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:34,533
Alex, you had a chance
to impress us

983
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,167
with your rainbow-sherbert
drip cake, and you fell short.

984
00:41:38,167 --> 00:41:40,333
It should have been colorful,
and it wasn't.

985
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:43,633
And the cake was
slightly overbaked.

986
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:49,833
The baker leaving us
today is...

987
00:41:49,833 --> 00:41:51,767
Beverly.

988
00:41:51,767 --> 00:41:54,300
So sorry, Beverly.
We are not gonna forget you.

989
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:55,633
Seriously.
-You are unforgettable.

990
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:57,233
Please keep baking,
'cause you're awesome.

991
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:59,833
Okay.
I will.

992
00:41:59,833 --> 00:42:00,967
We'll miss you, Beverly.

993
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,467
-Bye, Beverly.
-We're gonna miss you.

994
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,800
I had lots of fun while I was
here, and I'll never forget it.

995
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,067
-You never stop baking, okay?
-Thank you.

996
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,067
#KidsBakingChampionshipRocks.

﻿1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,500
DUFF: Previously on "Kids
Baking Championship"...

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,300
Ice cream cone drip cakes.

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
And you must make
actual ice cream.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,000
ABBY: I got pistachio.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,533
I know for a fact that I'm
gonna to taste pistachio.

6
00:00:19,633 --> 00:00:22,967
Only one baker really
brought it all together.

7
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:26,167
And that baker is Abby.

8
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:29,500
Soleil, your cookies
and cream cake was messy.

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,867
Beverly, this was a cake
and ice cream challenge,

10
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,300
and your ice cream
was soup.

11
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:37,467
The baker leaving us
today is Beverly.

12
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:42,333
**

13
00:00:42,433 --> 00:00:44,533
Hmm. Which one
do you like the best?

14
00:00:44,633 --> 00:00:45,800
Hmm.

15
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,633
That one looks like
coffee-cup stains.

16
00:00:47,733 --> 00:00:51,233
Oh, my God.
What is this?

17
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,433
Yeah, I'm going towards
that one, too.

18
00:00:52,533 --> 00:00:53,400
Yeah.

19
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,667
Why did they just set up
an art exhibit?

20
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:57,133
Oh, hi, bakers.

21
00:00:57,233 --> 00:00:58,900
-Hi.
-Hey, guys.

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,633
-Hi.
-Do you like our art gallery?

23
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,433
-Yeah.
-It's pretty.

24
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:06,500
This is your inspiration
for today's Big Bake.

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,900
What?

26
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,900
Today you will be making
an artful design

27
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:13,833
with doughnuts.

28
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:16,233
-Yes.
-Oh, my gosh.

29
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:21,567
And you'll be doing it...

30
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:22,633
in teams.
-Yes.

31
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,700
Yes, yes.

32
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,200
Oh, they like it.

33
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,233
Now, to choose your team,

34
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:32,067
you will each
take a doughnut.

35
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:34,900
On the back of the doughnut,
there will be a number

36
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,333
and the same numbers
will pair up.

37
00:01:37,433 --> 00:01:38,300
Thank you.

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,333
Turn your doughnuts
over and pair up.

39
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:42,800
-I got two.
-I got one.

40
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,833
-I'm one.
-Are you one?

41
00:01:44,933 --> 00:01:46,233
Yay.

42
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:47,933
Yay.

43
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:51,200
Okay, so here's our teams,
Bryn and Soleil,

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,800
Luke and Linsey,
Aditya and Alex...

45
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:55,067
I think it can work out.

46
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,133
I think that we can
really work this out.

47
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,933
DUFF:
...Abby and Julia.

48
00:01:59,067 --> 00:02:03,467
You each must individually
bake and decorate

49
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:05,500
one dozen doughnuts.

50
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,500
Then as a team, you will put
your two different doughnuts

51
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,600
together on one board
to create a unified design

52
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:17,467
that's good enough
to appear in our gallery.

53
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,067
I've never been
in an art gallery.

54
00:02:20,133 --> 00:02:22,167
Walk around
and you're like...

55
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,867
That is not true.

56
00:02:23,967 --> 00:02:25,200
Yeah, it is.

57
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,367
It's not...
You've never been to one.

58
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,267
How do you know?

59
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,933
I've seen one on TV,
in cartoons.

60
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:32,100
VALERIE: Your individual
doughnut will determine

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,467
whether you stay
or go home.

62
00:02:34,567 --> 00:02:37,067
All right.
Bakers, you have 2 hours.

63
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,367
Are you ready?

64
00:02:38,467 --> 00:02:39,133
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

65
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,667
Your baking time
starts...

66
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:43,633
now.
-Now!

67
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:44,933
ALEX:
You got it, dude.

68
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:48,967
**

69
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,333
-Let's put it by the sink.
-Okay. Okay.

70
00:02:50,433 --> 00:02:51,733
I decided to make
a strawberry doughnut

71
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,833
with coconut glaze.

72
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,267
Okay, okay.

73
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,733
So I was thinking maybe, like,
a chocolate doughnut, like,

74
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,200
cookies and cream, with, like,
a cream cheese glaze kind of.

75
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:59,200
Okay.

76
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,700
What kind of design
do we want to do?

77
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,067
We could do...We'll figure
it out when we start baking.

78
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:09,233
You could do
lemon blueberry.

79
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:11,067
Yeah.
So you're doing the...

80
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,567
-Bacon maple?
-Yeah.

81
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:13,633
Soleil had this great idea

82
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:16,167
to make doughnut flavors
for Duff and Valerie.

83
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:17,967
You ever try to nail
a doughnut to a wall?

84
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,933
It doesn't work.

85
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:22,900
Duff loves bacon,
and I have a great recipe

86
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,867
for maple bacon doughnuts.

87
00:03:24,967 --> 00:03:27,467
I was thinking make it
shaped like a doughnut.

88
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:28,700
Okay.

89
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,800
We're gonna try
to make this look

90
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,733
like a doughnut made
out of doughnuts.

91
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:35,167
We grabbed some felt pieces
to map out our plan...

92
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,933
Say the hole is, like,
right here.

93
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:40,967
BOTH: Our team name is
The Doughnut Ladies.

94
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,067
I'm so happy
that I got her...

95
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:43,100
We're really excited.

96
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,700
...because she's amazing.

97
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,433
-Like, this is the glaze.
-Yeah.

98
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:51,200
-Oh, I like it.
-Do you see it?

99
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,533
-Yeah, I see it.
-I see it.

100
00:03:52,633 --> 00:03:54,067
So I was thinking, like,
we could make, like,

101
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,367
a strawberry sort of thing,
where it's like this.

102
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,467
And if I do key lime,
I could dye it, like, green.

103
00:03:58,567 --> 00:04:00,733
I was thinking
I would do cinnamon.

104
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:01,833
With a red frosting,

105
00:04:01,933 --> 00:04:03,567
then I could make
a little strawberry.

106
00:04:05,167 --> 00:04:08,100
ABBY: Julia wants to make
a strawberry design,

107
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,067
but it's going
to be really had

108
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,067
to make a strawberry
on a peg board.

109
00:04:12,133 --> 00:04:13,200
ABBY: Should we just make it,
like, abstract?

110
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,167
Not try
to make a strawberry.

111
00:04:15,267 --> 00:04:16,133
Okay.

112
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,467
I need to come up
with the perfect design.

113
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:22,100
What about this?
It's like a swirl.

114
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,267
Ah, these circles are
giving me a headache.

115
00:04:24,367 --> 00:04:26,567
Let's get the doughnuts
done first.

116
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,800
JULIA: Okay.
Let's go.

117
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,533
So I'm gonna be doing
maple bacon popcorn.

118
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,400
So then mine would be,

119
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,900
I guess,
kind of colorful-ish.

120
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,933
-Yeah.
-So you know what?

121
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,100
I'll just pull together
my batter,

122
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,567
and then I can
flavor it later.

123
00:04:36,667 --> 00:04:39,800
-Okay.
-Yeah.

124
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,167
BRYN: I'm so excited.

125
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:44,633
I could eat doughnuts
for breakfast every day.

126
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:47,767
I'm gonna start by making
the actual batter part

127
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:49,233
for my maple bacon doughnut.

128
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,500
So I sift together flour,
baking powder and salt.

129
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,533
I use the sifter so when
I mix it all together,

130
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:58,267
it won't be all clumpy.

131
00:04:58,367 --> 00:05:01,500
For my wet ingredients,
I combine eggs, sugar,

132
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:05,600
milk, vanilla extract
and vegetable oil.

133
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:09,867
Then I fold the dry ingredients
into the wet ingredients

134
00:05:09,967 --> 00:05:12,767
and mix them all together.

135
00:05:12,867 --> 00:05:14,433
Soleil, how you
doing over there?

136
00:05:14,533 --> 00:05:16,567
I'm doing good,
how about you?

137
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:17,700
Good.

138
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,067
I am making a blueberry
doughnut with lemon glaze

139
00:05:22,133 --> 00:05:24,700
and blueberry drizzle on top.

140
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,267
I want to use whole blueberries

141
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:29,067
because when Duff and Valerie
bite into my doughnut,

142
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:33,800
I want them to just taste
the juice and the sweetness.

143
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,133
DUFF:
15 minutes down, guys.

144
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,900
You got an hour,
45 left.

145
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:39,133
I'm from Canada.

146
00:05:39,233 --> 00:05:41,200
We love our maple syrup,
and we love our bacon,

147
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,400
so I'm doing, like,
a maple bacon doughnut.

148
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,333
And then since I love snacking
on popcorn all the time,

149
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:47,967
I think I'm going
to add that, too.

150
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:51,433
Maple syrup is one of
the national flavors

151
00:05:51,533 --> 00:05:55,067
and one of the national
foods of Canada.

152
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,667
Everyone in Canada
loves maple syrup.

153
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,600
The doughnut part is basically
just a regular doughnut batter,

154
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,200
which I added some ground nutmeg
to give it more flavor,

155
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:10,467
and then I alternate between
milk and my flour mixture.

156
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,467
If you were to put, like, all
the milk at once and then mix it

157
00:06:13,567 --> 00:06:15,233
and then put all
the flour at once,

158
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,333
the consistency of your doughnut
would be very,

159
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:21,067
like, dense, really,
really dense.

160
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:22,900
It looks perfect.

161
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,933
I hope this doughnut
makes Canada proud.

162
00:06:25,067 --> 00:06:25,967
-Alex.
-Yeah?

163
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,633
I can do
a spiced doughnut.

164
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:28,900
ALEX:
That would sound good.

165
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:32,767
Okay, so you think that would
go with maple bacon, though?

166
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:36,200
It sounds
kind of, like, gross.

167
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,500
The flavors aren't supposed
to go together, dude.

168
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,967
They can be like
completely different.

169
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,267
Oh, okay.

170
00:06:40,367 --> 00:06:41,067
Oh, okay.

171
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,433
Yeah.
Okay.

172
00:06:42,533 --> 00:06:44,667
I'm making a spiced doughnut
with a lavender glaze.

173
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,233
I've never used lavender before,

174
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,900
and I thought that would be a
good idea for a spiced doughnut.

175
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:52,933
To flavor the glaze,
I need to get my lavender

176
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,600
to steep in the milk.

177
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,800
Then I put my spices
into the doughnut batter

178
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,867
and that's that.

179
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:03,667
**

180
00:07:03,767 --> 00:07:06,600
This is a handy tool.

181
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:09,467
I am making a strawberry
doughnut with coconut glaze

182
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:13,600
because I think those two
flavors go really well together.

183
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,067
I replaced some of the milk
with the strawberries

184
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,533
because I don't want
too many liquids.

185
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,400
I really want a natural
strawberry flavor

186
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,567
in the doughnut.

187
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:23,233
I don't want to get, like,
an extract or anything,

188
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:26,667
but I'm just afraid that the
strawberry may be too subtle.

189
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,067
It's fine.

190
00:07:28,133 --> 00:07:30,100
How is everyone doing?

191
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,167
-Good.
-Good.

192
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,867
What flavor are you making?

193
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:34,067
Cookies and cream.

194
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,067
My inspiration for this
is my love

195
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,400
for chocolate sandwich cookies.

196
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,900
If I put those
and a doughnut together,

197
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,833
it would just be
deliciousness.

198
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,800
I'm gonna make
a chocolate doughnut

199
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,500
to represent the cookie.

200
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,800
I add in cocoa powder
to make it chocolate,

201
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,100
and I'm gonna make
a cream cheese icing

202
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,233
to represent
the cream inside,

203
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:01,067
and then crush up
sandwich cookies

204
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,433
and sprinkle them on top.

205
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,200
I want to make
some doughnut art.

206
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,533
I'm gonna polka dot myself.

207
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:11,133
Look, kids, I'm art.

208
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,933
You should walk
around like that.

209
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:15,467
**

210
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:16,833
Just cinnamon.

211
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:20,600
I love cinnamon rolls, so I'm
making a cinnamon roll doughnut

212
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,433
with a cream cheese glaze.

213
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:25,333
And my sister's favorite
food is doughnuts,

214
00:08:25,433 --> 00:08:29,933
so I hope that I do her justice.

215
00:08:30,067 --> 00:08:33,067
I used the hand mixer
because the stand mixer

216
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:35,400
doesn't reach
the bottom of the bowl,

217
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,233
and it's much easier
with the hand mixer

218
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:39,733
to combine ingredients.

219
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,167
30 minutes down, bakers.

220
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:43,067
You have an hour
and a half left.

221
00:08:43,133 --> 00:08:48,200
Will you be around
after this challenge?

222
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,800
Wow, that's so funny.

223
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,600
I'm making a key lime doughnut
because my signature baked item,

224
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,267
especially because I'm from
Florida, is a key lime pie.

225
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:01,567
To get the key lime pie
flavor into my doughnut,

226
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:05,167
I add lime juice and lime
zest into my batter.

227
00:09:07,433 --> 00:09:09,667
Bakers, can we have
your attention, please?

228
00:09:09,767 --> 00:09:11,500
You've got
to be kidding me.

229
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,500
What is that?

230
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,133
DUFF: Doughnuts
are great and all,

231
00:09:14,233 --> 00:09:16,800
but doughnuts with texture

232
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:20,433
are a whole lot better.

233
00:09:20,533 --> 00:09:22,233
-What?
-Texture?

234
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:25,667
We have Macadamia nuts,
potato chips,

235
00:09:25,767 --> 00:09:27,700
graham crackers...
-Dang it.

236
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,767
I have to get the graham
crackers off that texture bar.

237
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:33,300
What's key lime pie
without a graham cracker crust?

238
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,933
...peanuts, pretzels,
cornflakes,

239
00:09:37,067 --> 00:09:41,267
chocolate wafers
and fruit cereal.

240
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:44,233
You must grab one texture
from our texture bar

241
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,533
and incorporate it
into your doughnuts.

242
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:49,967
Come on up and grab one.

243
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,700
-Just one.
-Just one.

244
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:52,967
Just one,
you cannot share.

245
00:09:53,067 --> 00:09:54,600
Chocolate wafer cookies.

246
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,467
LUKE: Fruit cereal?

247
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:57,167
Fruit cereal is awesome,
go with it.

248
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:59,500
-Wait, what did you need?
-Graham cracker.

249
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,400
Here, wait.

250
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,367
Does pretzels go
with cinnamon?

251
00:10:02,467 --> 00:10:04,433
You can't share
with your teammate.

252
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,300
I have to keep
my graham crackers.

253
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,900
Blech.
I have no idea.

254
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,200
Luke,
that's a good one.

255
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,633
-Okay.
-I promise.

256
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,333
I don't know how to incorporate
this with chocolate.

257
00:10:14,433 --> 00:10:16,367
-What is it?
-Fruit cereal.

258
00:10:16,467 --> 00:10:19,067
LUKE: Fruit cereal really
doesn't go well with my
doughnut,

259
00:10:19,167 --> 00:10:21,467
and I don't know what to do.

260
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,167
**

261
00:10:29,267 --> 00:10:31,100
VALERIE:
Doughnut designs.

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,067
You must grab one texture
from our texture bar

263
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:37,067
and incorporate it
into your doughnuts.

264
00:10:37,167 --> 00:10:38,267
LUKE: Fruit cereal?

265
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:39,700
DUFF: Fruit cereal is awesome.
Go with it.

266
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,367
The twist is, we have to add

267
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:44,300
in a crunchy component
into our doughnuts...

268
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,933
I don't know how to incorporate
it with chocolate.

269
00:10:46,033 --> 00:10:48,033
...and I get fruit cereal.

270
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,467
Of course.

271
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:51,667
I was the last one up there,
so I got stuck with it.

272
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:55,133
Fruit and chocolate
is good.

273
00:10:55,233 --> 00:10:56,933
I feel like it really
doesn't go well

274
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:58,500
with my cookies
and cream doughnut,

275
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,667
so I'm gonna crunch
them up real fine

276
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,733
so you don't
really taste them,

277
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:03,800
you just get
the crunch from them.

278
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,933
I pipe my doughnuts
into the pan

279
00:11:06,067 --> 00:11:07,800
and just sprinkle
the cereal on top

280
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,867
before I bake my doughnuts.

281
00:11:09,967 --> 00:11:11,067
I'm getting frustrated.

282
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,533
Luke is putting, like,
the tiniest amount

283
00:11:12,633 --> 00:11:13,833
of the fruit cereal
on his doughnuts

284
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,367
before he's baking it.

285
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:19,067
Bake it, frost it,
take that doughnut,

286
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,533
stick it in there,
cover that thing.

287
00:11:20,633 --> 00:11:21,933
Is that the sound that
it makes when a doughnut...

288
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,367
Yeah, okay.

289
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,967
**

290
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:26,933
Whatever.
This will go fine with it.

291
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:28,300
It doesn't taste different.

292
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,300
Now that I have pretzels
for my twist,

293
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,100
I'm switching the graham cracker
crumbs for pretzel crumbs.

294
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,800
I'm going for
a key lime pie thing,

295
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,467
so this will be
like the crust.

296
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:40,400
Hour and 15 minutes left,
bakers!

297
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,067
JULIA: I put my pretzel crust on
top of my doughnut batter,

298
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:44,533
and put it in the oven.

299
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:48,267
Glaze is usually just powdered
sugar and some sort of liquid.

300
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,833
For the key lime glaze,
I'm only doing powdered sugar,

301
00:11:51,933 --> 00:11:55,300
juice and zest.

302
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,267
How are you feeling, Julia?

303
00:11:57,367 --> 00:11:59,067
Oh, good.

304
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,267
Are these cinnamon
graham crackers?

305
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:04,333
**

306
00:12:04,433 --> 00:12:05,700
Nope.

307
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm really happy that I was
able to get graham crackers

308
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,533
for the texture twist

309
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:13,200
because I know that it goes
very well with cinnamon.

310
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,500
I'm going to make a graham
cracker cinnamon crumble,

311
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,867
so I crush them up
in the food processor

312
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,067
and add some sugar,
butter and cinnamon

313
00:12:22,167 --> 00:12:25,200
and sprinkle that on
the tops of my doughnuts

314
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,700
so that it will form a nice
crunchy texture and crust.

315
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,100
Whenever we make cinnamon rolls,

316
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,067
they have a cream
cheese frosting,

317
00:12:32,133 --> 00:12:35,933
so I'm adding in some cream
cheese in my glaze.

318
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:39,067
**

319
00:12:39,167 --> 00:12:41,100
That's pretty good.

320
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,467
Linsey, what'd you get?

321
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:44,933
Chocolate wafer cookies.

322
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,100
I grabbed the chocolate
wafer cookies

323
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,500
for my strawberry
coconut doughnut

324
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,800
because I know there's, like,
some chocolate coconut candies

325
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,500
out there and chocolate,
strawberry, that's a no-brainer.

326
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,600
I put it in a piping bag,
crush it up

327
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,367
and just top my doughnuts
with the cookies.

328
00:13:02,633 --> 00:13:04,500
-Those look good.
-Thanks.

329
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,367
LINSEY: I don't know if they're
strawberry enough though.

330
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,067
Now that my doughnuts
are in the oven,

331
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,367
I start working on my glaze.

332
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:13,133
Since I want it to be
coconut-flavored,

333
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,567
I just use coconut milk,
but kind of eyeball it.

334
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:16,967
It's too thin.

335
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:19,200
Just add either coconut milk
or powdered sugar

336
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,133
until I get the desired texture.

337
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:24,367
The consistency has to be,
like, just right

338
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,667
so it's not too, like, watery,

339
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,933
and it won't completely
soak into the doughnut,

340
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:30,567
but it also kind of
just stays on the top.

341
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,900
**

342
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,200
It's coconut-y.

343
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,967
Bryn, how are you
gonna use yours?

344
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,733
Are you just gonna crush
them up and put it in there?

345
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,567
-Probably.
-Okay.

346
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,867
I'm so glad that I did
not pipe my batter yet

347
00:13:43,967 --> 00:13:46,200
because I can put
this twist right in.

348
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,333
My twist ingredient
is macadamia nuts.

349
00:13:49,433 --> 00:13:51,433
I knew this was pretty much
the only thing that I could grab

350
00:13:51,533 --> 00:13:52,933
because it's, like,
one of the only things

351
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:56,800
that goes with my lemon
blueberry doughnut.

352
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,833
Maybe I want to toast these.

353
00:13:58,933 --> 00:14:00,567
I want to roast
these macadamia nuts

354
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,933
because that brings out
the natural flavors

355
00:14:03,067 --> 00:14:05,200
and it gives them
a nice crunch.

356
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,900
Then I pulse them up
until they are nice

357
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,567
and small and fold
them into my batter.

358
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,933
**

359
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,567
To make my lemon glaze,

360
00:14:14,667 --> 00:14:17,900
I'm mixing powdered sugar
with lemon juice.

361
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:22,067
I don't want to not have enough
lemon in there for Valerie,

362
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:26,633
so I need a lot
of lemon juice.

363
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:29,533
Is there a doctor in the house?
I'm seeing spots.

364
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:32,367
**

365
00:14:32,467 --> 00:14:34,300
They're like
two big eyeballs.

366
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,667
I see you.

367
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,367
**

368
00:14:39,467 --> 00:14:42,467
Cornflakes are kind of
all texture and no flavor,

369
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:48,067
so I'm going to just incorporate
some into the batter

370
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,733
and pulse some
of the cornflakes up

371
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,100
and sprinkle those on top,

372
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:56,100
that would also give
the doughnut a good texture.

373
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,267
The best doughnuts will
keep you in the running

374
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:02,733
for all the dough...
nuts.

375
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,633
I feel pretty good about
getting the potato chips

376
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:08,900
because I'm making
a maple bacon doughnut,

377
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:10,367
and the potato chips

378
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:13,367
add a little bit more saltiness
to go with my bacon.

379
00:15:13,467 --> 00:15:16,167
You can't really put potato
chips into the doughnut

380
00:15:16,267 --> 00:15:18,900
because it would be
kind of soggy,

381
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,400
so the only thing
that I can really do

382
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,633
is crush them up
and put them on the top.

383
00:15:23,733 --> 00:15:26,667
So I set it aside and start
on my candied bacon.

384
00:15:26,767 --> 00:15:31,300
I make a candied glaze
by mixing together sugar,

385
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,067
brown sugar and maple syrup

386
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,467
and brush it all over my bacon.

387
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:39,333
I put that in the oven
until it's medium,

388
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:42,900
in between soft and crispy.

389
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,767
Great.

390
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:47,200
I do not like peanuts
by themselves.

391
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,467
They're just weird.

392
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,600
What am I gonna do
with peanuts?

393
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,700
I don't want to use them,
but you know what?

394
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,067
I have to.

395
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,833
What can I do with nuts?

396
00:15:57,933 --> 00:16:00,633
Caramelize them.

397
00:16:00,733 --> 00:16:02,667
Caramelize the peanuts?

398
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,167
So when I'm thinking of texture,

399
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:07,467
I'm thinking of maybe like a
brittle or a caramelized peanut,

400
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,333
so I go with
caramelized peanuts.

401
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,533
Does anybody have
the maple syrup?

402
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:14,933
-Was that Alex that asked that?
-Mm-hmm.

403
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,233
-I do.
-Can I use it?

404
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:17,633
-Yep.
-Thank you.

405
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,633
You're welcome.

406
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,067
To make my caramelized peanuts,

407
00:16:20,167 --> 00:16:24,067
I take brown sugar,
milk, maple syrup,

408
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,333
and then I add in my peanuts.

409
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:29,633
Once my peanuts are
in the caramel,

410
00:16:29,733 --> 00:16:32,567
I put my bacon in the oven.

411
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:34,633
Bacon.

412
00:16:34,733 --> 00:16:37,833
I take my doughnuts out when
they start turning golden brown

413
00:16:37,933 --> 00:16:39,533
and check them
with a toothpick.

414
00:16:39,633 --> 00:16:40,567
Came out clean.

415
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:41,900
They are done.

416
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,200
Alex.
-Yeah?

417
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,833
Do you have the maple syrup
over there?

418
00:16:44,933 --> 00:16:47,100
Yeah, I do.

419
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,267
Trade off.
Again.

420
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,633
Are you doing
maple bacon, too?

421
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:50,767
Yeah.

422
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:52,667
ALEX: Bryn is not Canadian.
I am.

423
00:16:52,767 --> 00:16:54,933
Mine is gonna be better.

424
00:16:55,067 --> 00:16:57,067
Stay out of my territory.

425
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,700
BRYN:
I'm not worried at all.

426
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,667
Mine is gonna taste
the best and look the best.

427
00:17:02,767 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm making a maple glaze
by combining maple syrup,

428
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:08,900
milk and powdered sugar.

429
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:12,267
I glaze it first
by dipping the top

430
00:17:12,367 --> 00:17:14,333
of the doughnut
into my glaze,

431
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,367
and then I want a little bit
more coverage on it,

432
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:21,400
so I just end up pouring it
on top of my doughnuts.

433
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,567
My plan is to sprinkle
my candied bacon

434
00:17:24,667 --> 00:17:27,367
and potato chips on top.

435
00:17:27,467 --> 00:17:28,867
Ow.

436
00:17:28,967 --> 00:17:30,933
I'm doing a lavender
kind of glaze...

437
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:32,067
Cool.

438
00:17:32,167 --> 00:17:33,067
...so I'm gonna
make it purple.

439
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,067
So I think...
-All right.

440
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,233
...those will
go together, right?

441
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,700
I think this will really
work out pretty well.

442
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,967
Booyah.

443
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:45,267
I'm making a lavender
glaze with cardamom.

444
00:17:45,367 --> 00:17:49,533
It's a really popular spice
in Indian deserts.

445
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,567
I strain the lavender
out of the milk

446
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:53,500
and add some of
the purple food coloring.

447
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,500
I'm going for the subtle
lavender color

448
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,833
rather than a really
bright purple color.

449
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:01,900
There's a bit of a,
like, zing to it.

450
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:05,100
I definitely
taste the lavender.

451
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,233
One hour left, bakers.

452
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:10,300
All right.
I'm ready to start my glaze.

453
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,833
I'll use a little bit
of maple extract

454
00:18:12,933 --> 00:18:14,433
because I really
want it to be strong.

455
00:18:14,533 --> 00:18:18,233
I'm mixing it like
a mad man, eh?

456
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,067
Maple glaze is delicious.

457
00:18:20,167 --> 00:18:22,433
Hot, hot, hot.
My doughnuts look good.

458
00:18:22,533 --> 00:18:24,767
Crispy bacon.
And I think this bacon,

459
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:27,333
I'm gonna have
dreams about it later.

460
00:18:27,433 --> 00:18:30,367
Suddenly, I realized that
I forgot about my peanuts.

461
00:18:30,467 --> 00:18:32,467
Uh-oh.

462
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,167
Oh, my goodness.

463
00:18:34,267 --> 00:18:36,767
This is solidified.

464
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,133
Geez.

465
00:18:40,233 --> 00:18:41,900
They are the consistency
of a rock.

466
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,367
Oh, my God.

467
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:45,667
I don't know if I can fix this.

468
00:18:50,067 --> 00:18:53,567
**

469
00:18:53,667 --> 00:18:54,700
LINSEY: These are done.

470
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,100
VALERIE:
One dozen doughnuts.

471
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,700
Then you got
to work as a team

472
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,367
to make
a doughnut design.

473
00:19:01,467 --> 00:19:02,700
50 minutes left.

474
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,567
ALEX: It's solidified.

475
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,433
My caramelized peanuts
are solidified.

476
00:19:10,533 --> 00:19:12,067
Not good.

477
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,300
This has solidified quite a bit,

478
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,133
so I need to thin
it out somehow.

479
00:19:17,233 --> 00:19:20,300
I add about
a tablespoon of milk,

480
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,267
and it's not working for me,

481
00:19:22,367 --> 00:19:28,167
so I add more until it becomes
that thick caramel consistency.

482
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,133
I think this will be okay.

483
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:32,867
Go nuts for doughnuts.

484
00:19:32,967 --> 00:19:35,533
I have to go with it because
I still have to put the glaze

485
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,767
and my bacon on top
of the doughnuts.

486
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,300
SOLEIL: Oh, your doughnuts
look good.

487
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:44,500
I just glazed them twice
because, well, maple glaze,

488
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,833
it's delicious so...

489
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:48,600
Once my two layers
of glaze is dried,

490
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:53,367
I put my bacon and my
caramelized peanut clusters.

491
00:19:53,467 --> 00:19:57,700
**

492
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,167
I get my glaze on my doughnuts,

493
00:19:59,267 --> 00:20:02,700
and I sprinkle on some
of the cornflake crumbs.

494
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,400
I think I'll get
a bunch of texture

495
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,167
from sprinkling the cornflakes
on top of the doughnut.

496
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
LUKE: After I take my doughnuts
out of the oven,

497
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,367
I just throw them
right in the blast chiller.

498
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,933
I needed them to cool because
I don't want it to be all hot

499
00:20:16,033 --> 00:20:18,100
and just melt the icing.

500
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,233
It's a chocolate doughnut
and then a cream cheese icing,

501
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,333
which is basically
cookies and cream.

502
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,100
You can see the fruit cereal
on top of the doughnuts,

503
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,800
but when I ice it,
those colors will disappear,

504
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,000
and then I sprinkle
sandwich cookies

505
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,667
and milk chocolate chips
to drizzle on top.

506
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:37,333
I just want to hide the flavor
of the fruit cereal.

507
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,767
Luke, when you finish
with your glaze,

508
00:20:40,867 --> 00:20:41,967
do you want
to plan it out?

509
00:20:42,067 --> 00:20:43,033
-Yeah.
-All right.

510
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,533
I still have
a little bit to go.

511
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,267
LINSEY: I put the coconut glaze
on top of my doughnuts,

512
00:20:47,367 --> 00:20:48,900
then I take some
of the desiccated coconut,

513
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,067
sprinkle it on.

514
00:20:50,167 --> 00:20:51,567
Take some red sanding sugar

515
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,500
and I'll sprinkle that
on top to indicate

516
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,300
that there's strawberry
in my doughnut.

517
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,700
I think my doughnuts
are looking really pretty,

518
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:01,467
but now we have to make a design
on a board that looks like art.

519
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,167
Try, like, an "X."

520
00:21:03,267 --> 00:21:05,667
Actually, no, I don't know.
-No.

521
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:06,933
We don't exactly know
what to do because it's hard

522
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,633
to make a design
with circles.

523
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:10,267
Let's try that box thing.

524
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:13,933
Why do doughnuts
have to be so hard?

525
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,967
Oh, we can go in
and make a diamond...

526
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:17,067
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

527
00:21:17,133 --> 00:21:17,967
...because I only
I have two left.

528
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,733
Hi, guys.
What you doing?

529
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,867
We're trying
to make our design.

530
00:21:21,967 --> 00:21:23,267
You just pulled one
totally away.

531
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,400
You weren't crazy
about it?

532
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,667
Yeah.

533
00:21:25,767 --> 00:21:27,333
We just got a good idea.

534
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,067
You got a good idea?
Well, have at it.

535
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:30,533
I don't want to interrupt.

536
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:33,300
We finally settle
on this diamond design.

537
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,233
So now
we each have one left.

538
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,133
**

539
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:39,533
We have
two doughnuts left.

540
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:41,067
Okay, what do we do
with the extra ones?

541
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,233
We can just put
something right there.

542
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,067
-Yeah, in the corners.
-Okay.

543
00:21:45,167 --> 00:21:46,867
-That's what we're gonna do.
-Okay, let's go.

544
00:21:46,967 --> 00:21:50,267
It's settled.
Done.

545
00:21:50,367 --> 00:21:52,300
So scared
I'm gonna drop one.

546
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,933
-Push this in more.
-Yeah.

547
00:21:55,067 --> 00:21:58,433
All right.
Guys, 20 minutes left.

548
00:21:58,533 --> 00:22:01,733
To glaze my doughnuts,
I take the bottom part of it,

549
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:06,067
since it's a smoother part,
and I dip it in about halfway.

550
00:22:06,133 --> 00:22:08,100
So are we doing the swirl?
-Yeah.

551
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,533
Yeah, I think the swirl
was better.

552
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,600
ABBY: We don't have to use
red and green,

553
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,733
because I would do pink.

554
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:16,100
Red and green looks
too Christmas-y,

555
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,367
so I'm going to dye
my glaze beautifully pink

556
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:24,333
because pink is
my favorite color.

557
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,167
-I do. I like pink more.
-I like pink more.

558
00:22:29,267 --> 00:22:32,067
Look at the apron.
Look at the doughnut.

559
00:22:32,133 --> 00:22:34,533
Well,
my whole room is pink.

560
00:22:34,633 --> 00:22:37,067
Me, too.

561
00:22:37,167 --> 00:22:40,300
Well,
I have pink doughnuts.

562
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,067
Mm-kay.

563
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,233
I got the graham crackers
and the pink.

564
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,300
Ugh.

565
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,100
Julia, I'm gonna put
teal sprinkles on mine.

566
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Do you want to put, like,
pink sprinkles on yours?

567
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,133
That's a good idea, yeah.

568
00:22:54,233 --> 00:22:55,367
What a great idea.

569
00:22:55,467 --> 00:22:58,167
We could use sprinkles
that are the same colors

570
00:22:58,267 --> 00:23:00,867
as each other's glaze.

571
00:23:00,967 --> 00:23:03,300
Matching sprinkles, it is.

572
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,200
The doughnuts are
looking really good.

573
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,533
Now Abby and I need to get
our swirl assembled

574
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:09,067
on the peg board.

575
00:23:09,133 --> 00:23:12,233
-Does it fit?
-Yeah.

576
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,967
Soleil, what kind of doughnut
are you making?

577
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:15,400
Lemon blueberry.

578
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,967
Lemon juice is not going
to make my glaze

579
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,467
yellow enough for my taste.

580
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:21,533
I think I'm gonna try using
the air-brush machine.

581
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:24,500
It looks so cool.

582
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,133
I want to use
the air-brush machine

583
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,933
because I've never
actually used one before,

584
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,467
and it looks super cool,
so I just want to, like,

585
00:23:31,567 --> 00:23:35,600
lightly add a little bit
more yellow color.

586
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,933
Okay.

587
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:39,700
To decorate, I made, like,
a blueberry compote

588
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:46,167
with blueberries, lemon juice,
lemon zest and sugar.

589
00:23:46,267 --> 00:23:50,633
Then I made some candied
Macadamia nuts to put on top.

590
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:51,900
I'm about to be finished.

591
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,167
I just need to do
a couple more things.

592
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,333
Okay.

593
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:57,067
To assemble my doughnuts,
I put my potato chips

594
00:23:57,133 --> 00:23:59,367
and candied bacon on top,
and there you go,

595
00:23:59,467 --> 00:24:03,467
you have the maple bacon
potato chip doughnut.

596
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,267
13 minutes, bakers.

597
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:09,267
Okay, so one row of mine,
yours, mine,

598
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:11,133
well, kind of mine
and yours and yours.

599
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:13,100
To decorate our doughnut canvas,

600
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,967
we're going to try to do
a zigzag kind of pattern.

601
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:17,267
Yo, how are you doing?

602
00:24:17,367 --> 00:24:18,767
-How's it going?
-Great.

603
00:24:18,867 --> 00:24:20,067
What's the plan?

604
00:24:20,133 --> 00:24:22,200
-A zigzag.
-Okay.

605
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,633
ADITYA: It's going to be
more mathematical

606
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,200
but still, like, art.

607
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,933
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Should we flip it

608
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,533
so it's like this,
or do you think this way?

609
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,600
Um, I think it was good
the way it was.

610
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,367
-Okay. Good.
-All right.

611
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:34,633
I'm just gonna eat
one of these doughnuts.

612
00:24:34,733 --> 00:24:36,600
-No.
-He's like, "No."

613
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,300
I need them.

614
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,733
I hope it's going to work.

615
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,667
Yeah, it's a design.

616
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,200
VALERIE:
Time is ticking away.

617
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,267
What can you do to make
that design the absolute best?

618
00:24:46,367 --> 00:24:48,467
LUKE: This actually
looks really cool.

619
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,333
These kind of look
awkward, though.

620
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:53,167
We're making a doughnut
out of doughnuts.

621
00:24:53,267 --> 00:24:54,367
SOLEIL:
Bryn and I grabbed dowels,

622
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:56,300
started sticking them
in everywhere,

623
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,833
and then we put
our doughnuts on.

624
00:24:57,933 --> 00:24:59,067
Does that look
like a doughnut?

625
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:00,767
Yeah. Do you think it looks
like a doughnut?

626
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:02,067
I think so.

627
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,833
SOLEIL: We think it looks
like a doughnut.

628
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:05,467
You see the cake part

629
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:08,700
and then you see the frosting
like that.

630
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,167
Like that.

631
00:25:10,267 --> 00:25:12,667
It looks like art,
I'm pretty sure.

632
00:25:12,767 --> 00:25:14,067
DUFF:
Four minutes, guys.

633
00:25:14,133 --> 00:25:16,933
I see some designs that
I don't know what they are.

634
00:25:17,067 --> 00:25:18,100
Oh, my gosh.

635
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,100
She's talking about ours.

636
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,233
Okay, let's do
a new doughnut.

637
00:25:21,333 --> 00:25:22,067
Okay.

638
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:24,100
DUFF: Is this
the best you can do?

639
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,067
Why don't I put one of my
doughnuts here instead?

640
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:27,200
ALEX: Yeah, I agree.

641
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,267
I feel like that would...
You know...

642
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,900
Okay.
What should we do?

643
00:25:30,067 --> 00:25:31,567
I don't know.

644
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,300
We're freaking out, and we,
like, try and move stuff around

645
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,067
to make it look more
like a doughnut...

646
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:37,267
I don't know.
Okay, wait.

647
00:25:37,367 --> 00:25:39,167
We're just making it worse.

648
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,800
-Three minutes.
-Switch these.

649
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,200
We don't have time
for this.

650
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,500
DUFF:
Is your design awesome?

651
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,167
Ours isn't.

652
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,800
**

653
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,900
DUFF: Doughnut Designs.

654
00:25:54,067 --> 00:25:56,967
Will this design go
in our art gallery?

655
00:25:57,067 --> 00:25:58,233
Yeah.

656
00:25:58,333 --> 00:26:01,233
We'll be the judge
of that.

657
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,500
I see some designs that I
don't know what they are.

658
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,067
They have to be
talking about ours.

659
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,867
-Oh, let's do a new one.
-Okay.

660
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,200
We don't have time
to pull out the pegs

661
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,433
and then put all
the doughnuts back on.

662
00:26:12,533 --> 00:26:13,867
One minute left.

663
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,700
So we're just trying
to rearrange it

664
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,267
to make it shape better.

665
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,633
Maybe if we, like,
put them closer together...

666
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,600
-10...
-Okay.

667
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:22,367
-9...
-Switch these two.

668
00:26:22,467 --> 00:26:24,867
Wait, no.
Just leave it there.

669
00:26:24,967 --> 00:26:27,500
-7...
-6...5...

670
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,433
4...3...2...1.

671
00:26:31,533 --> 00:26:33,400
Hands up.

672
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:36,133
**

673
00:26:36,233 --> 00:26:38,600
Does it look better now?

674
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,633
I can't really tell.

675
00:26:40,733 --> 00:26:42,567
Doughnut Designs.

676
00:26:42,667 --> 00:26:44,933
Edible art, man.
This is kind of my thing.

677
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,500
This is gonna be
so cool.

678
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,067
Do you think we should bring
in Alex and Aditya,

679
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,867
the "A" team?
-Yes, absolutely.

680
00:26:50,967 --> 00:26:53,533
All right.
"A" team, get in here.

681
00:26:53,633 --> 00:26:54,900
A little easier coming
in here with a buddy?

682
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:57,100
Yeah.

683
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,367
Tell us about your design,
you guys.

684
00:26:58,467 --> 00:27:01,733
So for our design,
we both love to do fusion,

685
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,067
so I thought fusion of patterns.

686
00:27:04,167 --> 00:27:05,233
Is that your explanation

687
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:06,933
for why there's
Aditya's doughnuts,

688
00:27:07,067 --> 00:27:09,267
then your doughnuts,
then there's like oops.

689
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,567
ADITYA: I still think
the colors and everything

690
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:12,367
go well together.

691
00:27:12,467 --> 00:27:13,800
VALERIE:
I think they do, yeah.

692
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,267
It's just it's such a pattern
and then all of a sudden,

693
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,333
there's, like,
a lavender doughnut

694
00:27:17,433 --> 00:27:20,967
where a peanut maple
bacon doughnut should be.

695
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:23,167
Well,
I think if this doughnut

696
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:27,133
and if this doughnut
got switched.

697
00:27:27,233 --> 00:27:29,667
Now, that's a pattern.

698
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:32,500
Yeah.

699
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,067
We're gonna taste
the doughnuts one at a time,

700
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,067
and we'll start
with Aditya's.

701
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:38,133
I made a spiced doughnut.

702
00:27:38,233 --> 00:27:43,200
I put cinnamon, nutmeg, ground
ginger and allspice in it,

703
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:46,400
and then I made
a cardamom lavender glaze.

704
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,300
And for the twist,
I topped it with cornflakes

705
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,100
and also there are cornflakes
inside the doughnut.

706
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,333
I think it's
absolutely beautiful,

707
00:27:54,433 --> 00:27:58,167
and I think it's
a very yummy spiced doughnut.

708
00:27:58,267 --> 00:27:59,800
Really taste the ginger,

709
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,100
but with all those strong,
warm spices,

710
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,800
I still
taste the lavender.

711
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,933
But I think
it's slightly dry.

712
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:09,300
Now, you put cornflakes
in the batter?

713
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,500
Yeah.

714
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,467
The moisture that
you were looking for

715
00:28:12,567 --> 00:28:15,100
inside your doughnut
is now inside those cornflakes,

716
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,400
but also the texture that
you were going for goes away.

717
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,400
Okay.

718
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,400
I definitely got some
from the top here,

719
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,833
but it was subtle.

720
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:26,300
Let's move to Alex.

721
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,333
Okay.

722
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:30,600
This just looks likes
a taste adventure.

723
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:35,167
I made a maple bacon
and caramelized peanut doughnut.

724
00:28:35,267 --> 00:28:38,333
I call it the Ultimate
Canadian Fever Dream.

725
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,767
-You got your maple...
-Bacon.

726
00:28:40,867 --> 00:28:42,867
It looks
like a hockey puck.

727
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,267
Yeah, it kind of does.

728
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:46,333
Mm-hmm.

729
00:28:49,133 --> 00:28:50,233
The doughnut is great.

730
00:28:50,333 --> 00:28:51,933
It's got
nice maple flavor.

731
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:53,767
It's not too much.
Your bacon is crunchy.

732
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,600
You rendered it
really well,

733
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,100
but your bacon is crunchier
than your peanuts.

734
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,767
-Oh.
-Always toast your nuts.

735
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:02,167
You're gonna get
a better crunch,

736
00:29:02,267 --> 00:29:04,333
and you don't want
your nuts to kind of mush.

737
00:29:04,433 --> 00:29:05,267
Yeah.

738
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:06,333
But I like that maple,
the brown sugar.

739
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:08,067
It's really nice
and it's brown

740
00:29:08,133 --> 00:29:09,667
and it's just, mm,
it tastes good.

741
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,700
But it's a little dry

742
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,800
when you get into
that doughnut.

743
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:15,833
Yes,
you can have my bacon.

744
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,700
It's okay.
Thanks, guys.

745
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,533
-Thanks, guys.
-Thank you.

746
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:23,067
**

747
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,567
It's a diamond.

748
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:27,767
It's sort of the representation
of, like, a game.

749
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,167
Yeah.

750
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,300
I wonder if they're
listening to us out there.

751
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,800
Oh,
they wouldn't do that.

752
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,300
Would they?
-I don't know.

753
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:38,100
I think it looks like...
space checkers.

754
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,667
-Oh, no.
-Yes.

755
00:29:39,767 --> 00:29:41,067
-Is that a good thing?
-Yeah.

756
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,967
Sure. Yay.
Woo.

757
00:29:42,067 --> 00:29:43,567
DUFF: It's super weird.

758
00:29:43,667 --> 00:29:46,133
Aw.

759
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:49,133
-L and L.
-L and L. Yeah.

760
00:29:49,233 --> 00:29:52,200
So tell me
about your design.

761
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,833
Basically, our design
is a diamond

762
00:29:55,933 --> 00:29:58,533
with a layer of my doughnuts,

763
00:29:58,633 --> 00:30:00,800
and Linsey's doughnuts, and my
doughnuts and Linsey's doughnuts

764
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,133
going all the way down.

765
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:04,467
But you forgot two.

766
00:30:04,567 --> 00:30:08,867
Those two didn't really
fit into the diamond,

767
00:30:08,967 --> 00:30:10,900
so we just put them
on the top.

768
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,800
So it's a diamond
in the rough?

769
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,233
-Yes.
-Mm-hmm.

770
00:30:14,333 --> 00:30:15,800
I really like the fact
that there are these

771
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,267
two extra doughnuts
on top

772
00:30:17,367 --> 00:30:19,800
because I feel like it's one
of each of you, you know,

773
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,067
and this is something that
you guys have collaborated on.

774
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:23,800
I'm not buying it
totally.

775
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,767
Art is subjective.
-All right.

776
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,067
Linsey,
what did you make today?

777
00:30:27,167 --> 00:30:30,933
I made a strawberry doughnut
with a coconut glaze

778
00:30:31,033 --> 00:30:34,667
and chocolate wafer
cookies for a crunch.

779
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:37,833
It's the mullet
of doughnuts.

780
00:30:37,933 --> 00:30:40,567
Business in the front,
party in the back.

781
00:30:40,667 --> 00:30:42,133
Uh-huh.

782
00:30:42,233 --> 00:30:43,667
You guys don't even know
what a mullet is.

783
00:30:43,767 --> 00:30:45,267
I know it's a hairdo.

784
00:30:45,367 --> 00:30:46,667
It's like the thing that's
short, but then it's long.

785
00:30:46,767 --> 00:30:47,900
Yes.

786
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,433
I had a mullet when I was
about your age.

787
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,567
Wait, seriously?

788
00:30:50,667 --> 00:30:52,300
-Yeah.
-What?

789
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,967
I want to see
what that looks like.

790
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:56,100
**

791
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,467
Really cool.
All right.

792
00:30:58,567 --> 00:30:59,833
Let's eat this thing.

793
00:31:00,067 --> 00:31:03,767
**

794
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:06,500
That kind of taste
like a pancake?

795
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,067
Mm-hmm.

796
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,100
It's a little buttery,
which is awesome.

797
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,133
I love pancakes.

798
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,533
Nothing wrong with that.

799
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:15,367
I'm definitely getting
the texture of the cookies

800
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:17,567
and that's really good,
and I'm getting the coconut,

801
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:19,733
but I'm really not
getting any strawberry.

802
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:20,833
Okay.

803
00:31:20,933 --> 00:31:22,667
I love this doughnut,
though.

804
00:31:22,767 --> 00:31:24,133
It's perfectly baked.

805
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:26,200
It's nice and moist,
but if you're gonna sell me

806
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:27,500
a strawberry doughnut,

807
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,767
I agree,
I should taste strawberry.

808
00:31:29,867 --> 00:31:30,833
Okay.

809
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:32,200
Luke, what did you
make for us?

810
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,133
Today, I made for you
a cookies and cream doughnut

811
00:31:35,233 --> 00:31:39,300
with a fruit cereal crumble,
cream cheese glaze

812
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,467
and then a dark
chocolate drizzle

813
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:45,267
and a crushed sandwich cookie.
-Okay.

814
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,833
What was your
twist ingredient?

815
00:31:46,933 --> 00:31:48,567
-Fruit cereal.
-Fruit cereal.

816
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,700
So you were already gonna put
the cookie in there.

817
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,400
**

818
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,900
Looking for
the fruit cereal.

819
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:56,533
I see them.
They're really small.

820
00:31:56,633 --> 00:31:57,800
Okay.

821
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,967
*M

822
00:32:01,067 --> 00:32:02,300
So, yeah, you know,
the fruit cereal

823
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,067
really needs to be there.
You know what I mean?

824
00:32:04,167 --> 00:32:05,133
This was
a texture challenge.

825
00:32:05,233 --> 00:32:07,300
I can't really feel it,
you know?

826
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,267
I would have liked more
of the fruit cereal

827
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:11,300
because that together
with the chocolate

828
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,967
really does
taste terrific,

829
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:15,300
and I love your dark
chocolate drizzle

830
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,967
with the glaze
that's on top,

831
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,067
but you didn't fill up
the doughnut pan

832
00:32:19,133 --> 00:32:20,300
with enough batter,

833
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,333
so the doughnut is
a little on the dry side.

834
00:32:22,433 --> 00:32:24,800
It's not, like, the most moist
doughnut I've ever had,

835
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,567
but it's not super dry.

836
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:27,400
Maybe because your doughnut

837
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
is a little bit bigger
than mine,

838
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,867
it's not as dry as mine.

839
00:32:30,967 --> 00:32:32,667
-Okay.
-Thanks, guys.

840
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:34,267
-Thank you.
-Bye, thank you.

841
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:37,267
Honestly, I'm really
nervous right now.

842

00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:53,300
Our team name is
Team Doughnut Swirl.

845
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,800
Abby and Julia,
come on in.

846
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:57,900
Hey, guys.

847
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,200
-Hi.
-Hello.

848
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,933
What was your plan
for the design?

849
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:03,467
ABBY: We wanted it to look
like a swirl.

850
00:33:03,567 --> 00:33:04,400
VALERIE: It does.

851
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,867
It totally looks
like a swirl.

852
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:08,833
I think it's really
groovy, man.

853
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:12,233
It's all crazy.

854
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:14,933
You coordinated on colors,
pink with green sprinkles

855
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,333
and green
with pink sprinkles.

856
00:33:16,433 --> 00:33:18,733
You guys really
thought this out.

857
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,167
We did.

858
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:21,800
I think
that's pretty cool.

859
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,600
But how does it taste?

860
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,533
Delicious.

861
00:33:26,633 --> 00:33:27,800
Abby,
what did you have?

862
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:30,067
I have made a cinnamon doughnut

863
00:33:30,167 --> 00:33:33,067
with a graham cracker
cinnamon crumble

864
00:33:33,167 --> 00:33:38,700
on the bottom for texture
and cream cheese glaze.

865
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:41,700
I feel like I'm getting ripped
off on the glaze here.

866
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,233
You could have gone
all the way

867
00:33:43,333 --> 00:33:44,600
because it looks so good.

868
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,233
I want more of it.

869
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:48,800
I'm so disappointed,
because I love that glaze

870
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,900
so much, because
it's really yummy.

871
00:33:51,067 --> 00:33:52,900
I love
the cinnamon flavor.

872
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:55,100
I would love a big cup
of coffee with this.

873
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,933
It would be perfect.
-Mm.

874
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:59,300
Mm,
that's a good doughnut.

875
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,667
It's got
a good density to it.

876
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:03,300
I think the graham crackers
is great texture,

877
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,633
but I think that your doughnut
could have been

878
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:08,267
a little sweeter.

879
00:34:08,367 --> 00:34:09,700
Sweeter.

880
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,433
I think just
a tiny bit sweeter,

881
00:34:11,533 --> 00:34:13,367
this doughnut would
have ruled.

882
00:34:13,467 --> 00:34:15,100
All right.
Let's move onto Julia's.

883
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,167
Mine is a key lime doughnut
with a pretzel crumble

884
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:22,400
on the bottom for the texture,
and it's a key lime glaze.

885
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,333
A lot of times on this show
people tell us something

886
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:29,467
is gonna be key lime
flavored and it never is.

887
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:30,767
Okay.

888
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:32,667
It totally tastes
like key lime.

889
00:34:32,767 --> 00:34:33,967
Florida is key lime.

890
00:34:34,067 --> 00:34:35,833
You know what a key lime
is supposed to taste like.

891
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,067
It's nice and strong.

892
00:34:37,167 --> 00:34:38,133
It's really upfront,
and it's good.

893
00:34:38,233 --> 00:34:39,467
It's not too much.

894
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:43,433
It's really bright
and tart but sweet.

895
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:45,667
But I'm not a fan
of these pretzels.

896
00:34:45,767 --> 00:34:46,800
They almost taste stale.

897
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,200
Okay.

898
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,267
Like they were sitting
in the oven,

899
00:34:49,367 --> 00:34:51,333
and they lost
their pretzelness.

900
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,667
Your doughnut
is really good.

901
00:34:52,767 --> 00:34:55,267
-Thank you.
-Thanks, guys.

902
00:34:55,367 --> 00:34:58,367
**

903
00:34:58,467 --> 00:35:02,767
Bryn and Soleil,
come on in.

904
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,667
VALERIE: We're looking
at your design

905
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,533
and going, "What is it?"

906
00:35:07,633 --> 00:35:09,433
It's a doughnut.

907
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:14,767
So Soleil's doughnut
is, like, the frosting,

908
00:35:14,867 --> 00:35:16,533
and then my doughnut

909
00:35:16,633 --> 00:35:22,467
is, like, the actual
baked part of it.

910
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:24,567
SOLEIL: It's, like,
from the side view.

911
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,233
It's a side...

912
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,467
-There's the hole.
-Yeah, that's the hole.

913
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,200
-Here's the icing.
-Then you look like that.

914
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,333
BRYN: And then
here's the baked part.

915
00:35:32,433 --> 00:35:36,067
-We tried to be creative.
-Use your imagination.

916
00:35:36,133 --> 00:35:38,067
Do you see it now?

917
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,233
DUFF: I'm looking at it
from the side.

918
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,533
Let's hold up a doughnut.

919
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:45,600
**

920
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,833
Oh, now I see it.

921
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:51,367
-Yay.
-No, I don't.

922
00:35:51,467 --> 00:35:54,100
We thought it looked like
a doughnut, but okay.

923
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,567
I bet they taste
really yummy, though.

924
00:35:56,667 --> 00:35:58,067
I hope so.

925
00:35:58,133 --> 00:35:59,533
Soleil, tell us
about your doughnut.

926
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:04,333
I made a blueberry doughnut
with some macadamia nuts in it,

927
00:36:04,433 --> 00:36:08,067
and I have a lemon glaze and
it's not that yellow, actually.

928
00:36:08,133 --> 00:36:12,233
I air-brushed it, and then I put
a blueberry drizzle

929
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:14,800
with some crushed
macadamia nuts on top.

930
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,333
**

931
00:36:17,433 --> 00:36:20,400
DUFF: I'm not sure if the
air-brushing was your friend.

932
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,533
It looks like ketchup,
mustard, blue cheese

933
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:26,333
and garlic cloves.

934
00:36:26,433 --> 00:36:31,433
But the blueberry and
the lemon on the glaze,

935
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:33,367
it all goes together
so beautifully,

936
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:37,067
and I can even taste
the crunch of the macadamias.

937
00:36:37,133 --> 00:36:39,833
But here's the thing, Soleil,
you have a whole blueberry

938
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,500
and you put it
in the oven, it explodes,

939
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,733
and all you're left with
is just that citric acid,

940
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,100
and it gets really,
really sour.

941
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,300
-Okay.
-You want to bust them up,

942
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,200
and you want to mix
it into the dough.

943
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:50,167
-Yeah. Okay.
-Okay?

944
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:51,633
Bryn, tell us
about your doughnut.

945
00:36:51,733 --> 00:36:55,767
Well, today I made a maple bacon
doughnut with potato chips,

946
00:36:55,867 --> 00:37:00,067
and I caramelized
the bacon on top.

947
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:02,867
I love how much you've
glazed this doughnut.

948
00:37:02,967 --> 00:37:04,267
There's a ton
of glaze on it,

949
00:37:04,367 --> 00:37:05,900
all dripping
around the edges.

950
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:07,933
I'm about to take
a second bite.

951
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:10,467
You first get that
bacon saltiness.

952
00:37:10,567 --> 00:37:12,467
I'm definitely getting
potato chip texture,

953
00:37:12,567 --> 00:37:15,900
and that is the moistest
doughnut I have tasted today.

954
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,067
Really moist.

955
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:19,167
It's just soft
and pillow-y inside.

956
00:37:19,267 --> 00:37:20,867
Let me give you
a tip, though.

957
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,533
This bacon is
not cooked enough.

958
00:37:22,633 --> 00:37:23,833
Oh, okay.

959
00:37:23,933 --> 00:37:24,833
I would definitely cook it
a little bit more,

960
00:37:24,933 --> 00:37:26,067
a little crispier.

961
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:27,867
That being said,
it's really, really good.

962
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:29,067
-Thank you.
-Really.

963
00:37:29,133 --> 00:37:30,533
-Good job.
-Thanks, guys.

964
00:37:30,633 --> 00:37:32,533
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

965
00:37:32,633 --> 00:37:33,600
-Thank you.
-Bye.

966
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,067
SOLEIL: I know they didn't like
my presentation,

967
00:37:35,133 --> 00:37:36,800
and they didn't like it
last week either,

968
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,267
so I'm feeling a bit nervous.

969

977
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:07,567
I liked Luke and Linsey.

978
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:09,167
That looks really good.

979
00:38:09,267 --> 00:38:11,067
They made
this diamond shape,

980
00:38:11,133 --> 00:38:12,333
and they had an extra
doughnut each.

981
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:15,667
They really did create
a good representation of them

982
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:17,100
working together
as a team.

983
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,133
I really enjoyed it.

984
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,067
I enjoyed
Julia and Abby's.

985
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:21,900
I liked the way they worked
with each other,

986
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,933
that one
had pink frosting,

987
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:27,100
the other had green
and then opposite sprinkles.

988
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,333
You know, I think
we're on the same page.

989
00:38:28,433 --> 00:38:29,867
I'll tell you,
there's one doughnut

990
00:38:29,967 --> 00:38:31,233
that really stood out
for me today.

991
00:38:31,333 --> 00:38:33,300
-Who's that?
-Aditya.

992
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,167
It was a beautiful doughnut
and that looked like

993
00:38:35,267 --> 00:38:37,167
it should have been in
a high-end shop in Paris.

994
00:38:37,267 --> 00:38:38,967
He had
a beautiful glaze.

995
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:41,933
Who at 11, 12 years old
is using lavender correctly?

996
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:43,600
But it was
on the dry side,

997
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,500
and there were a few doughnuts
that really stood out

998
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,633
because they were
perfectly moist.

999
00:38:47,733 --> 00:38:48,733
Bryn.

1000
00:38:48,833 --> 00:38:50,133
Perfectly moist.

1001
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:52,267
I loved the maple flavor,

1002
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:54,067
and I got the crunch
of the potato chip.

1003
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,300
It needed a little more
crunch from the bacon.

1004
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,733
You loved that doughnut,
don't deny it.

1005
00:39:00,267 --> 00:39:01,633
I got to be honest.

1006
00:39:01,733 --> 00:39:03,067
There are a few items

1007
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,967
that I "dough" not
ever want to see again...

1008
00:39:06,067 --> 00:39:07,533
I see
what you did there.

1009
00:39:07,633 --> 00:39:09,600
Like Soleil's.

1010
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,833
That doughnut, today,

1011
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,867
was definitely
the messiest looking,

1012
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:14,933
but the lemon
was nice and bright.

1013
00:39:15,067 --> 00:39:17,200
But it technically
wasn't sound.

1014
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,200
True.

1015
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:20,267
The blueberries exploded
inside the batter,

1016
00:39:20,367 --> 00:39:24,133
and so what I got was
sour bombs inside the doughnut.

1017
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:26,300
For me today,
Luke stumbled.

1018
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,133
His doughnut
was inconsistent.

1019
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:29,700
Yours was really dry,
mine wasn't.

1020
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,767
Mm-hmm.

1021
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,100
Good chocolate flavor,
I thought.

1022
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,133
But I don't think he thought
it through all the way.

1023
00:39:34,233 --> 00:39:37,067
Luke did not use
his twist very well.

1024
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,900
Fruit cereal
is so good.

1025
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,500
He should have rolled
the entire doughnut

1026
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:41,167
around in that stuff.

1027
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:42,533
-Right?
-Totally.

1028
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:44,267
Yeah.

1029
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:47,800
Which one of those two
bakers stumbled more

1030
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:48,967
and has to go home?

1031
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,533
**

1032
00:39:51,633 --> 00:39:55,467
Bakers, we asked you to go
nuts with doughnuts,

1033
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,733
and you did.

1034
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:59,900
Some of you,
maybe a bit too nuts.

1035
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,033
And because this was
a team design challenge

1036
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:03,867
as well
as a baking challenge,

1037
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,433
we want to give
a special nod

1038
00:40:05,533 --> 00:40:07,967
to the most appealing
doughnut design today,

1039
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:12,667
which came from the team
of...

1040
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:14,800
Abby and Julia.

1041
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,500
-Yes.
-Congratulations.

1042
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,833
Your spiral doughnut design
was a knockout,

1043
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:21,467
but that doesn't mean that
either one of you are safe.

1044
00:40:21,567 --> 00:40:23,400
We told you in the beginning
that you would be judged

1045
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,400
on your doughnuts
individually,

1046
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:32,433
and only one doughnut
was a hole in one,

1047
00:40:32,533 --> 00:40:35,167
and that baker is...

1048
00:40:35,267 --> 00:40:36,400
Bryn.

1049
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:37,433
Yay.

1050
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:39,033
I'm sorry, I'm just
really excited.

1051
00:40:39,133 --> 00:40:41,233
The bacon, maple
and potato chip

1052
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,900
was a great combination.

1053
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,500
Thank you.

1054
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,833
A few other doughnuts
were also sweet enough

1055
00:40:46,933 --> 00:40:48,533
to keep you
in the competition.

1056
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:49,733
Aditya...

1057
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:50,900
Really?

1058
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,767
-Linsey.
-Good job.

1059
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,533

-Yay.

Oh, thank God.

Unfortunately, that
leaves Soleil and Luke.

1064

Please step forward.

1065

LUKE: I'm really
scared right now.

1066
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:13,800
I haven't been on
the bottom yet.

1067
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:16,200
It's really not a good feeling.

1068
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,967
Soleil, the presentation

1069
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:20,300
of your blueberry
macadamia doughnut

1070
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,133
left a lot
to be desired,

1071
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,967
and using
the whole blueberries

1072
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:25,400
just didn't work for me.

1073
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:29,300
SOLEIL: These have been
the greatest weeks of my life.

1074
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,567
I really don't want
to go home yet.

1075
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:33,967
Luke, your cookies
and cream doughnuts

1076
00:41:34,067 --> 00:41:35,233
were inconsistent,

1077
00:41:35,333 --> 00:41:37,367
and the smaller doughnuts
were a little dry.

1078
00:41:37,467 --> 00:41:38,600
We really wish you would
have embraced

1079
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,533
your twist
ingredient, too.

1080

You both have brought so much
to this competition,

1081
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:47,400

leaving us today is...

Being on "Kids
Baking Championship"

1089
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:02,967
has made me a better baker,

1090
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:04,900

I've learned so much.

It's like a swirl.

VALERIE: Abby and Julia, your
spiral doughnut design

6
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:20,000
was a knock-out.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,667
But one doughnut was
a hole in one, Bryn.

8
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,200
Yay.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,767
Bacon, maple, and potato
chip was a great combination.

Soleil, the presentation
of your doughnut

11

to be desired.

-Anatomy?

interested in unicorns.

will be making a unicorn...

I'm deciding
to do an orange cake

represents Florida.

I could do a normal
vanilla buttercream,

a little bit too dense.

butter and sugar.

something a little bit

-Yep, take it.

00:19:29,767 --> 00:19:31,067
Happiness.

441
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:33,067
Jazz hands.

442
00:19:33,067 --> 00:19:36,600
**

443
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,300
Bakers, may we have
your attention, please?

444
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,967
-Oh.
-Yes.

445
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:42,200
Are you kidding me?

446
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,733
Your unicorn cakes
are looking so great,

447
00:19:43,733 --> 00:19:46,800
we think they each
deserve their own name.

448
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,233
What?

449
00:19:48,233 --> 00:19:51,133
You must all bake up
an edible name plate

450
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:54,067
for your unicorn's stall.

451
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:55,600
Kinda like these.

452
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,300
My unicorn's name
will be Charlie.

453
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,200
And mine
would be Gazpacho.

454
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,033
You gotta bake up
something from scratch,

455
00:20:04,033 --> 00:20:06,933
and put your
unicorn's name on it.

456
00:20:06,933 --> 00:20:10,367
Wait, okay.

457
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,733
LUKE: Everyone's
going everywhere.

458
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,300
I think we threw a
horseshoe into the machine.

459
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,433
I think we can go now.

460
00:20:14,433 --> 00:20:16,633
-Okay.
-That was a fight.

461
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:19,533
ALEX: Oh, my God, my legs hurt
from all this running.

462
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:21,200
I'm not very excited
about this twist

463
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,067
'cause I have to bake
something completely

464
00:20:23,067 --> 00:20:25,667
different than what I'd planned.

465
00:20:25,667 --> 00:20:28,133
I'm gonna bake this
leftover cake batter in this

466
00:20:28,133 --> 00:20:31,100
and then use buttercream
to pipe a name.

467
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,267
**

468
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:38,000
ABBY: I'm going to do
a sugar cookie name plate.

469
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,433
I'm creaming together
butter and sugar.

470
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:44,200
Then I add in my
eggs and vanilla,

471
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,800
and then I'm pouring in
my flour, baking powder,

472
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:53,367
salt, cream of tartar,
and I mix that together

473
00:20:53,367 --> 00:20:56,100
until it's perfect
sugar cookie dough.

474
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,733
I hate this twist.

475
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,667
But I'm gonna be
making a sugar cookie.

476
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,700
I decide to name my unicorn
Milo because, like,

477
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,433
when I was young, I used to have
this dog that was named Milo.

478
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:11,567
He died when I was
about 3 years old.

479
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:14,467
I had so much love for Milo,
so I want to put just as much

480
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:17,067
love for this cake
that's named Milo.

481
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,333
No wonder I got loving.

482
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:21,200
It reflects on how
I feel about things.

483
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:24,767
I absolutely hate the twist.

484
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:27,533
**

485
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,133
To make my edible name plate,

486
00:21:29,133 --> 00:21:32,400
I'm going to make
a shortbread cookie.

487
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,833
I am angry just like my unicorn.

488
00:21:35,833 --> 00:21:37,433
And then I cut it
onto a name tag.

489
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:40,067
And then just probably
pipe on some buttercream

490
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,333
and pipe out a name.

491
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,767
Right now, I'm making
a shortbread cookie

492
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,800
for the name plate.

493
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,733
I'm gonna name my unicorn Fred.

494
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:52,600
And I have nothing
against the name Fred.

495
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:54,700
If your name is Fred,
I applaud you.

496
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,167
That's a great name.

497
00:21:56,167 --> 00:21:58,933
But imagine if you had,
like, a pet unicorn,

498
00:21:58,933 --> 00:22:02,867
and he's like magical, majestic,
colorful, rainbow creature.

499
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:05,867
And its name is Fred.

500
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,267
**

501
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:12,267
ADITYA: To create my edible
name plate, I just bake

502
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:17,100
a shortbread cookie in
a rectangular kind of shape.

503
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,267
BRYN: Luckily, my cake is
pretty much done.

504
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:24,067
It's looking pretty
good at the point,

505
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,233
so I can focus on my twist.

506
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:27,767
I start to make
rice cereal treats

507
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:30,767
for this edible name 'cause
they're quick and easy.

508
00:22:30,767 --> 00:22:32,667
DUFF: 30 minutes, bakers.

509
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:37,067
For a unicorn cake
and a baked name plate.

510
00:22:38,833 --> 00:22:40,467
Oh, my God.

511
00:22:40,467 --> 00:22:43,767
I realize that rice cereal
treats are not baked.

512
00:22:46,067 --> 00:22:48,833
They are cooked but not baked.

513
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:52,067
I start freaking out.

514
00:22:52,067 --> 00:22:56,600
I have no idea what I can do
for this edible name plate.

515
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
Uh-oh, Bryn's upset.

516
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:07,600
**

517
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,733
I'm freaking out
'cause I have no idea

518
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:12,767
what I can do for this
edible name plate.

519
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,933
What's going on, honey?

520
00:23:13,933 --> 00:23:15,400
I'm just worried.

521
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm scared that I'm not
gonna have enough time.

522
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,900
You got this.

523
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,533
Okay, keep working.
-Okay.

524
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:24,600
It's okay, Bryn.
You'll figure something out.

525
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,400
BRYN:
I get myself together.

526
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:31,267
I start making sugar
cookie dough right away.

527
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:33,900
I throw some balls of
cookie dough onto the pan.

528
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,600
I'm just hoping that they
bake fast and they taste good.

529
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,333
22 minutes, guys.

530
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,933
ADITYA: For my horn,
I'm going to wrap

531
00:23:43,933 --> 00:23:46,767
gum paste
around a waffle cone.

532
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:47,833
How's it going?

533
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:49,200
Tell me about your twist.

534
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,467
What are you gonna make?

535
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,800
For my twist, I'm making
a shortbread cookie.

536
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,333
And do you have a name picked
out for your sad unicorn?

537
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:58,200
If I'm really pressed for
time, I'll just name it Duff.

538
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,667
But I'm never sad, ever.

539
00:24:00,667 --> 00:24:02,067
Good luck.

540
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,667
Okay, thanks.

541
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,700
I'm running out of time,
and I have a lot to do,

542
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:14,067
so I pipe rosettes and just
kind of blobs onto my cake.

543
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:16,600
I definitely have
to make the design

544
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,800
a bit less complicated than
what I was planning in my head.

545
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,767
To draw the eyes and
the eyelashes onto my cake

546
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:27,167
to make sure that my
unicorn looks sad,

547
00:24:27,167 --> 00:24:29,200
I've got tears on there,
so I just use

548
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,500
a bit of leftover
blue buttercream.

549
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,867
**

550
00:24:33,867 --> 00:24:37,133
LINSEY: I'll make a mane out
of the colored buttercream.

551
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,400
I try to put them all
into one piping bag.

552
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,500
Then I kind of mix together
the edges of each color

553
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,933
'cause I want the blue
and pink edges

554
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,233
to have a little bit of purple.

555
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:48,133
So it's like the full rainbow,

556
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:51,433
and I kind of like
wrap it around.

557
00:24:51,433 --> 00:24:52,733
Wrap it.

558
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,933
11 minutes for
a unicorn cake

559
00:24:57,933 --> 00:25:00,333
and a baked name plate.

560
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,300
JULIA: My cakes look
a little bit too brown,

561
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,833
so I'm hoping they're
not like a rock.

562
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:06,533
I frost it with some leftover

563
00:25:06,533 --> 00:25:08,567
white Swiss meringue
buttercream.

564
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:11,567
I decide to write the name
Pinkie on my mini cake

565
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:13,967
because I have this
one stuffed animal

566
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:17,500
I've had since I was born,
and I named her Pinkie.

567
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,867
**

568
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:22,133
LUKE: I take out my cookie, and
it's a little bit under-baked,

569
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,867
but I can live with it.

570
00:25:23,867 --> 00:25:26,067
I just think cookie dough
tastes really good.

571
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,967
I don't know what
to do for my name.

572
00:25:27,967 --> 00:25:31,067
I'm just thinking of any
names that sound really tough,

573
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,733
something like El Macho.

574
00:25:34,067 --> 00:25:35,333
Big Balf.

575
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,533
Balf, yeah, I like Balf.

576
00:25:37,533 --> 00:25:38,767
Oh, that's a good name.

577
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:41,633
It sounds tough and
like an angry unicorn.

578
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:44,867
Like, "I am Balf."

579
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:47,500
**

580
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,433
ABBY:
I'm taking my sugar cookie.

581
00:25:49,433 --> 00:25:53,967
I write out my unicorn's name,
Dash, onto its name plate,

582
00:25:53,967 --> 00:25:56,067
and it looks perfect.

583
00:25:56,067 --> 00:25:57,633
I'm naming my unicorn Dash

584
00:25:57,633 --> 00:26:00,700
because I'm a competitive
cross-country runner.

585
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,733
And she's very
fast just like me.

586
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:07,700
**

587
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:10,067
BRYN: The cookies look nice
and golden brown.

588
00:26:10,067 --> 00:26:12,733
I douse them with powdered sugar

589
00:26:12,733 --> 00:26:16,533
just in case my sugar
cookies taste like biscuits.

590
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,267
And I write the name,
Belle, on my cookie.

591
00:26:19,267 --> 00:26:21,767
I named my unicorn Belle
just because I think

592
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:26,567
it's a pretty name, and I also
kind of thought of my sister.

593
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:30,233
Her middle name is Belle,
and my dad's middle name

594
00:26:30,233 --> 00:26:32,967
is Belle, so it kind of
just runs in the family.

595
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:36,133
And these cookies are going
to be called cloud cookies.

596
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:40,267
-Six minutes.
-Six minutes, guys.

597
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,867
ALEX:
Golden brown perfection.

598
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:45,267
I pull out my sugar
cookie from the oven.

599
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:47,200
I trim it off to
make almost like

600
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,167
a Welcome to Las Vegas shape.

601
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:53,567
I start to pipe my "M."

602
00:26:53,567 --> 00:26:57,067
It looks like ghostly printing.

603
00:26:57,067 --> 00:26:58,700
Oh, my gosh.

604
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:01,567
DUFF: 2 minutes,
30 seconds.

605
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:05,700
Name plates, emotions,
finished cakes.

606
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,833
ADITYA: The last thing I throw
together is my name plate.

607
00:27:07,833 --> 00:27:11,567
With an edible marker, I write
Duff Jr. on my shortbread cookie

608
00:27:11,567 --> 00:27:13,867
and hope it
doesn't bleed too much.

609
00:27:13,867 --> 00:27:17,067
**

610
00:27:17,067 --> 00:27:18,200
LINSEY: No.

611
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,467
Some of my cookies break

612
00:27:19,467 --> 00:27:20,867
because they're,

You know, I think the eyes

796
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,700
I do wish they
had pupils though.

Oh, yeah.

798
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:48,533
I love the way you've
just covered the whole

799
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:51,267
top of the cake with all
different, lovely colors.

800
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:52,967
I am a little concerned

801
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:55,233
with how thin
your frosting looks

802
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:57,100
'cause your cake
is showing through.

803
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,300
-Oh, okay.
-Your horn?

804
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:01,833
Such a colorful cake
with a brown horn.

805
00:34:01,833 --> 00:34:04,133
I would have colored it.

00:34:04,133 --> 00:34:05,467

Yes.

810
00:34:10,433 --> 00:34:11,967
But, Alex, it is
a little over-baked.

811
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:12,967
Okay.

812
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,433
It's a little
on the dry side.

813
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,367
Your cake is dry.
The lemon flavor is great.

814
00:34:16,367 --> 00:34:17,467
Goes great with
your buttercream.

815
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:18,667
Tell us about
your name plate.

816
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:20,567
So my name plate
is a sugar cookie.

817
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:22,833
What happened near the
end of Milo's name there?

818
00:34:22,833 --> 00:34:24,533
Uh...

819
00:34:24,533 --> 00:34:26,100
Let's taste
the name plate.

820
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,100
I wish the cookie was
a little bit thinner.

821
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,167
It's good flavor.
-Oh, thank you.

822
00:34:32,167 --> 00:34:33,500
But there's some room
for improvement.

823
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,967
-Okay, thanks, Alex.
-Thanks, Alex.

824
00:34:34,967 --> 00:34:36,467
Thank you.

825
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,267
I think Alex made
a lot of mistakes,

826
00:34:39,267 --> 00:34:40,900
but a lot of easy ones
that he could have fixed.

827
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,167
Mm-hmm.

Hello.

831
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:51,633
I got "worried"
for my unicorn.

832
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:54,633
I think that you
absolutely captured it.

833
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:55,800
How appropriate

834
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,633
because you seemed worried
the whole day.

835
00:34:57,633 --> 00:34:58,767
Yeah.

836
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,767
What kind of flavor
cake did you make?

837
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:04,600
I made an almond cake
with a raspberry buttercream

838
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,433
and an almond buttercream
on the outside.

839
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:11,933
And my name plate is made
out of a sugar cookie,

840
00:35:11,933 --> 00:35:15,067
and my unicorn's name is Dash.

841
00:35:15,067 --> 00:35:16,333
Dash.

842
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:18,867
'Cause it's really
fast just like me.

00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,333
You did a beautiful job.

844
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:22,433
I like that you used
licorice for her face.

845
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:24,633
Dash's horn
is a little droopy.

846
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:25,700
Yeah.

847
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,733
I think in his worry,
he's kind of...

848
00:35:27,733 --> 00:35:29,100
Okay.

849
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,967
You want to cut into it,
so we can try it?

850
00:35:30,967 --> 00:35:33,700
Sure.
My cake is four layers.

851
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,533
Wow, four layers.

852
00:35:35,533 --> 00:35:37,267
Oh, boy.

853
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,267
Wow,
look at that cake!

854
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:41,267
Yeah,
cake looks great.

855
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:44,800
That has got some
great almond flavor.

856
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,333
And that jam really
works well together

857
00:35:46,333 --> 00:35:47,833
along
with the buttercream.

858
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:50,933
I wish you had used a jam
that was seedless.

00:35:50,933 --> 00:35:52,333
Oh, yeah.

860
00:35:52,333 --> 00:35:54,133
I don't mind the seeds.
That's just me.

The buttercream is sweet.

866
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,200
And I think with the jam,
it kind of gives you

867
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,500
a little bit
of an acidity.

it wasn't so thick.

Yeah.

871
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:10,100
I wish it was decorated
a little more.

Dash is so beautiful
and so vibrant.

and filled
with blueberry coulis.

you can't really
write on a cookie.

The cookie is gonna suck up
any liquid it touches.

00:04:03,367 --> 00:04:05,200
Ham and cheese?
I got ham and cheese.

107
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,067
That's, like,
one of my favorite sandwiches.

108
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,567
I'm so excited.

109
00:04:09,567 --> 00:04:11,300
Loaf pan.

110
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,167
So I'm making an imposter
ham and cheese sandwich,

111
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,733
and I'm thinking, for my bread,

112
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,867
I'm going to do lemon
pound cake, as my cheese,

113
00:04:18,867 --> 00:04:20,433
orange white chocolate.

114
00:04:20,433 --> 00:04:22,667
I'm not sure what I'm gonna
do for, like, the ham yet,

115
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:25,733
but I think my side dish
is gonna be a salad,

116
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,767
so let's make
the lemon pound cake.

117
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:29,500
"Bread."

118
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
When my butter and sugar
is creamed together,

119
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,367
I alternate between
my dry ingredients

120
00:04:33,367 --> 00:04:35,133
and my wet ingredients
until all of my dry

121
00:04:35,133 --> 00:04:37,800
and wet ingredients
are all finished.

122
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,367
I'm putting my lemon pound cake
batter into a loaf pan

123
00:04:40,367 --> 00:04:41,767
because I want it
to look like bread,

124
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:44,800
so I equally separate it
between two loaf pans,

125
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,067
and I get into the oven
as fast as possible

126
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:49,867
'cause these
things need to bake.

127
00:04:49,867 --> 00:04:52,133
I do not feel that good
about getting turkey wrap

128
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,767
'cause I've never had one.

129
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:56,900
My mom has had one,
but she's not here so hope

130
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,333
I can pull this off.

131
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:01,200
I have turkey wrap,
and for the turkey,

132
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,967
I'm doing a blondie
sliced up and airbrushed.

133
00:05:04,967 --> 00:05:06,600
For the tortilla,

134
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,833
I'm doing a crêpe,
so for the crêpe batter,

135
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:12,267
I'm whisking together
the eggs and the flour.

136
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,700
I slowly add in some water
and milk,

137
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,433
and then I add in salt

138
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:18,633
and some unsalted,
melted butter.

139
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,767
I start to add in some
green food coloring

140
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,600
so it looks like one
of those spinach tortillas.

141
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,967
ALEX: Time?

142
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:29,600
DUFF: 15 minutes gone, hour
and 45 minutes left, bakers.

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,067
ALEX: Oh, my gosh.

144
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:33,533
-Yay, imposters!
-Yay!

145
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,533
-It's imposters day!
-It's so much fun! I love it!

146
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:37,700
Whoo-hoo!

147
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,633
Nothing.

148
00:05:39,633 --> 00:05:41,700
Bryn's looking at me
like I'm crazy.
[ Laughs ]

149
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,167
-Well, Bryn would be right.
-[ Laughs ]

150
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:46,733
At school lunch, I eat, like,
a mix of things.

151
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,700
Sometimes, it's, like,
really unhealthy,

152
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,300
and sometimes, it's pretty,
like, average, you know.

153
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,833
I got chicken nuggets.
I'm so excited.

154
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,100
I think they're one
of the easiest things

155
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:01,867
that you could get in your lunch
box to turn into an imposter.

156
00:06:01,867 --> 00:06:03,900
-Whoa.
-You good?

157
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:06,233
-Oops.
-[ Laughs ]

158
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,067
BRYN: I'm making cake balls
because it's easy to mold

159
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:13,367
into chicken nugget shapes
with sugar cookie french fries.

160
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,067
My cake is in the oven.

161
00:06:15,067 --> 00:06:17,133
Sugar, sugar.

162
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:19,567
For my sugar cookie
french fries,

163
00:06:19,567 --> 00:06:23,467
I mix together powdered
sugar, eggs, and butter,

164
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:27,833
and then I add in
my baking powder and my flour

165
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,100
and mix it all together

166
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,333
until it stops sticking

167
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,833
from the sides of the bowl.

168
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,400
Cookie dough.

169
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,300
Then I put it
in the blast chiller.

170
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,367
Whoa. It's, like,
snowing in here.

171
00:06:37,367 --> 00:06:40,400
If you don't chill it,
it'll stick to the board,

172
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,733
and it'll just be
a lot harder to work with.

173
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:48,433
But then I realize I totally
forgot the vanilla extract,

174
00:06:48,433 --> 00:06:50,567
so I run back, take it out

175
00:06:50,567 --> 00:06:54,067
and just mix in
my vanilla extract by hand.

176
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,567
That should work. See?

177
00:06:55,567 --> 00:06:58,467
All you got to do
is problem solve.

178
00:06:58,467 --> 00:07:01,433
Without the vanilla, it probably
tastes like a biscuit,

179
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:03,900
and you don't want a biscuit.

180
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,300
-Bryn?
-Yeah?

181
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,467
What do you think looks
more like peanut butter,

182
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,967
a cookie butter buttercream
or a pastry cream?

183
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,533
Probably the pastry cream
because it's thicker.

184
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,167
Pastry cream? Okay.
That's what I thought.

185
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,533
I'm gonna do that.

186
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,733
I got a peanut butter
and jelly sandwich,

187
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:22,567
and for my
lunch box imposter "bread,"

188
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:27,300
I'm making a vanilla cake,
and for my peanut butter,

189
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,067
I want to use
a vanilla bean pastry cream,

190
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:33,800
and I also want to have
a homemade jam as the jelly.

191
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,967
Yum.

192
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:36,333
To make my pastry cream,

193
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:38,700
I'm combining my milk
and cornstarch,

194
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,967
adding my egg yolks,

195
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:45,367
and then I'm heating up
milk and sugar on the stove

196
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,967
until it comes to a boil.

197
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,567
Ah!

198
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:50,833
Oopsies.

199
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,300
It's all good.

200
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,600
I'm slowly adding in
my milk and sugar mixture

201
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,867
to my egg mixture
to temper the eggs.

202
00:07:58,867 --> 00:08:00,367
If you don't temper your eggs,

203
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:02,400
then you'll have
scrambled egg pastry cream,

204
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,467
and that is disgusting,

205
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:07,467
so you better make sure
that you temper your eggs.

206
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:10,333
And then I add in my butter
and vanilla bean

207
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,600
and pour it through a strainer

208
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,500
to get rid of any
leftover egg chunks.

209
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,967
I'm adding brown food coloring

210
00:08:16,967 --> 00:08:20,167
to my pastry cream,

211
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:21,433
and it looks like
peanut butter.

212
00:08:21,433 --> 00:08:24,067
VALERIE:
90 minutes left, bakers!

213
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,467
Come on.

214
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,900
Your lunch should look fake
but taste really good.

215
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,967
Yes. [ Chuckles ]

216
00:08:30,967 --> 00:08:33,100
I wish my lunch could be
dessert imposters every day

217
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:35,400
'cause that means,
like, cake or cookies

218
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,067
or brownies or anything

219
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,533
every single day for lunch.

220
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:44,100
That's all I want in the world.
[ Laughs ]

221
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,767
Linsey, what are you
doing for the bread?

222
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:47,500
I'm just making a lemon cake.

223
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,700
A lemon cake?

224
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,533
Yeah, because I'm using
marzipan for the bologna,

225
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:55,067
and almond goes
with lemon, so...
Nice.

226
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,467
Going in the oven!

227
00:08:57,467 --> 00:08:59,867
So to make my bologna,
I get marzipan,

228
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:03,100
which is an almond paste
that's been sweetened,

229
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:06,100
put some food coloring
in and dye it pink.

230
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,867
Look at Linsey's bologna.

231
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,067
She's coloring marzipan.

232
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,067
It looks exactly like bologna.

233
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:13,300
I love marzipan.

234
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,533
And that's no bologna.

235
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:16,233
[ Laughs ]

236
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:18,400
When I was little, I used
to eat bologna plain,

237
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,633
and you would, like,
bite little holes in it,

238
00:09:20,633 --> 00:09:22,067
and, like, my face
was small enough

239
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,733
because the piece of
bologna was this big,

240
00:09:23,733 --> 00:09:26,467
and you'd, like, look through it
and pretend that was your face.

241
00:09:26,467 --> 00:09:28,400
I remember doing that so much.

242
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,767
My dad would do it, and then
the bologna slice was too small.

243
00:09:32,767 --> 00:09:35,367
I love American cheese
on my sandwiches,

244
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:38,200
so I take some yellow
coating chocolate,

245
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,700
melt it and spread it out
on some parchment paper.

246
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,767
-What's that?
-I'm making cheese.

247
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:46,100
What the heck am I
gonna do with this?

248
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,367
Tuna salad, seriously?

249
00:09:49,367 --> 00:09:53,433
Mayonnaise and tuna is basically
what a tuna salad is,

250
00:09:53,433 --> 00:09:58,267
and those are two gross
things combined, just ugh.

251
00:09:58,267 --> 00:10:00,100
This better taste good.

252
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,367
I'm making an imposter
tuna salad sandwich

253
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,633
with white cake as the bread.

254
00:10:05,633 --> 00:10:08,867
For my tuna salad, I'm making
a coconut pastry cream

255
00:10:08,867 --> 00:10:10,833
with whipped cream

256
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:14,367
and then marshmallows
for little chunks of tuna.

257
00:10:14,367 --> 00:10:16,633
Hour and 15 minutes
left, bakers,

258
00:10:16,633 --> 00:10:19,100

00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,300
-Aw.

Can't we just send them
to detention for a couple days?

00:10:23,933 --> 00:10:25,667
-Nope.
-No?

263
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,500
"Kids Baking Championship"
is kind of like school

264
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,333
because we get challenges,
which are like the tests,

265
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,433
and then Duff and Valerie
are like the teacher,

266
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,633
and, like, someone
gets sent home,

267
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,467
which is like someone
getting an F.

268
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:40,067
I don't want to get an F
on this tuna salad test.

269
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,833
Oh, shoot.

270
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,533
I'm done with my pastry cream,

271
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:47,300
and after I strain it and pour
it into the whipped cream,

272
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:52,833
I realize it is really
gummy and thick.

273
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,067
Okay.

274
00:10:54,067 --> 00:10:56,800
This is a little strange.

275
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,167
Ew.

276
00:10:58,167 --> 00:10:59,833
If I gave the judges
a gummy pastry cream,

277
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:03,267
they would say that it
looks like tuna salad, ugh,

278
00:11:03,267 --> 00:11:05,800
but then it would
just taste nasty,

279
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,467
so I just have to throw
it away and start over.

280
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,733
-One hour left, bakers!
-Dish, wait.

281
00:11:10,733 --> 00:11:13,133
Lunch box imposters,

282
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:15,467
the cafeteria will be
shutting down in 1 hour!

283
00:11:21,467 --> 00:11:25,067
**

284
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,167
DUFF:
One hour left, bakers!

285
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,167
Dish, wait.

286
00:11:27,167 --> 00:11:29,333
Lunch box imposters,

287
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,333
the cafeteria will be
shutting down in 1 hour!

288
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,333
Uh-oh.
I'm a little concerned.

289
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,533
Luke is scrapping
his pastry cream.

290
00:11:37,533 --> 00:11:38,667
Wonder why.

291
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,633
Well, usually, that means
he scrambled it.

292
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:43,133
Ugh. Okay.

293
00:11:43,133 --> 00:11:46,633
So my pastry cream
turned out gummy,

294
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:48,367
so I'm going to plan B

295
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:51,067
where I'm gonna make
a coconut whipped cream

296
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:53,433
as the filling for the inside.

297
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:54,833
This whipped cream
is super easy.

298
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:58,400
It's just heavy cream,
coconut milk, and sugar.

299
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,733
My whipped cream
comes together,

300
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:01,800
so I'm adding
in coating chocolate.

301
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,600
I'm gonna do orange and green
for carrots and celery

302
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,167
and then marshmallows
for texture

303
00:12:08,167 --> 00:12:11,333
of, like, little chunks
of tuna in tuna salad.

304
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,733
This better work out.

305
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,967
Okay. What do I still
have to make?

306
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:17,867
I made the cheese, bologna.

307
00:12:17,867 --> 00:12:19,867
Oh, pie.

308
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,233
For my side dish, I'm going to
use pie crust to create chips.

309
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,300
Here we go.

310
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,933
Usually, for school, for lunch,

311
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:27,733
I usually have, like,
a ham and cheese sandwich,

312
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:31,367
so I have had quite a few
ham and cheese sandwiches.

313
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:32,933
That looks like cheddar
cheese color.

314
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:35,900
Once my chocolate has melted
and is dyed orange,

315
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,267
I spread it on a sheet pan.

316
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:40,500
Duh, duh, duh, duh, cheese.
I love cheese.

317
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I love, love, love,
love, love cheese.

318
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,733
Ham, what am I gonna
do for the ham?

319
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:48,133
Maybe a crêpe, I could do
a crêpe as the ham

320
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:49,867
and then just dye it.

321
00:12:49,867 --> 00:12:52,300
Bakers, can we have
your attention, please?

322
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,533
-Oh, my god.
-Oh, boy.

323
00:12:53,533 --> 00:12:54,967
Mm.

324
00:12:54,967 --> 00:12:58,067
We realize we forgot to give you
a drink in your lunch boxes.

325
00:12:58,067 --> 00:13:02,267
You need to double check next
time when you pack our lunches.

326
00:13:02,267 --> 00:13:03,967
So we have juice boxes.

327
00:13:03,967 --> 00:13:05,233
Great.

328
00:13:05,233 --> 00:13:06,667
I don't need juice
in my lunch box.

329
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,167
Can't I just have water?

330
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:11,767
Your job is to incorporate
the juice into your dessert

331
00:13:11,767 --> 00:13:14,700
in a way that we can taste
and that makes sense.

332
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,133
I love juice boxes, but I don't
like baking with them.

333
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:19,533
That's just unusual.

334
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:20,767
Come on up. First come --

335
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:21,967
-Come on up and get your juice.
-...first slurp.

337
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,400
Berry, berry, berry.

338
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,667
-This one.
-Mixed berry.

339
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:29,100
-Perfect.
-I guess passion fruit.

340
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,967
[ Laughs ]

341
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:33,233
Great.
Those guys were thirsty.

342
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,833
What the heck does
a passion fruit taste like?

343
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,367
Back to the cafeteria,
lunch lady.
Yes.

344
00:13:38,367 --> 00:13:40,533
Okay.

345
00:13:40,533 --> 00:13:41,767
Okay.

346
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:43,067
Okay.

347
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,200
I get orange juice
for the twist,

348
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,067
and I'm not very
excited about this

349
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,333
because I already
have everything made.

350
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,867
I already baked everything.

351
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:53,567
My blondies are baked, so my
orange juice can't go in that,

352
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:55,633
and I already have
my crêpe batter done.

353
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,500
Bye.

354
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,633
I decide the crêpes
are the easiest thing

355
00:13:59,633 --> 00:14:02,233
to scrap right now,
so I just dump everything out,

356
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,967
and now I'm making
an orange-crêpe batter.

357
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:07,567
In my crêpe recipe, I replace
the water with the orange juice.

358
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:09,867
I'm adding green food coloring
because I want it

359
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:11,433
to look like a spinach tortilla.

360
00:14:11,433 --> 00:14:14,700
VALERIE: 45 minutes left, guys!
45 little old minutes!

361
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,900
What?

362
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,133
Okay.

363
00:14:20,133 --> 00:14:22,400
I'll get that in two seconds.

364
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,067
I've never had a passion
fruit before,

365
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,733
so I have no idea
what it tastes like.

366
00:14:27,733 --> 00:14:29,200
First time you've ever
had passion fruit?

367
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,500
-Mm-hmm.
-You got it.

368
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,133
You got it.
Show me them muscles.

369
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,567
No. Ugh!

370
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:38,233
-Come on. You got it.
-Can you open it for me?

371
00:14:38,233 --> 00:14:39,200
Yes. [ Laughs ]

372
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,600
Thank you.

373
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,800
Okay.

374
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,400
And you're tasting?
And what do we got?

375
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,233
It kind of tastes
like orange juice

376
00:14:46,233 --> 00:14:48,067
but, like, strawberries
in it kind of.

377
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:49,533
Okay.
I like how you tasted it.

378
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,933
It was like tasting
a fine wine.
[ Laughs ]

379
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:52,967
You aerated a little.

380
00:14:52,967 --> 00:14:54,167
-It's good.
-Yeah.

381
00:14:54,167 --> 00:14:55,500
Got to get all those flavors,

382
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,867
make sure you taste
all those flavors.

383
00:14:56,867 --> 00:14:58,300
You got -- Yeah, totally.

384
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,500
I definitely think
the passion fruit juice

385
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:04,467
will make a really good fruity
buttercream for my cake balls.

386
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,767
Butter.

387
00:15:05,767 --> 00:15:08,467
So I cream together butter
and powdered sugar.

388
00:15:08,467 --> 00:15:11,967
Then I add in some of
my passion fruit juice.

389
00:15:11,967 --> 00:15:14,100
Ooh, it smells good.

390
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:17,933
For my chicken nuggets, I pulse
the cake in a food processor

391
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:20,400
until it forms small crumbs,

392
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,133
and then I put in some
of my buttercream

393
00:15:23,133 --> 00:15:25,733
and form it into
chicken nugget shapes

394
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:28,267
and put it into
my cereal mixture,

395
00:15:28,267 --> 00:15:30,800
and so it looks like
it's just been fried.

396
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Ooh!

397
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,300
What are you making?
Your chicken nuggets?
Yeah.

398
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
-Are you gonna deep fry them?
-No.

399
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,100
-No?
-That's scary.

400
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,200
Ta-da.

401
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,767
I need one of these.

402
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:47,400
I get mixed berry juice.

403
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,233
I'm already making
a strawberry jam,

404
00:15:50,233 --> 00:15:53,500
so now I can just make
a mixed berry jam instead.

405
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,600
I like to see that Abby
is making her own jam.

406
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
PB and J, I mean,

407
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,767
she could've grabbed the jam
off the shelf, but...

408
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:00,367
That's not a lot of work.

409
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:02,800
That's no "Kids
Baking Championship" move.
Mnh-mnh.

410
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,233
To make my mixed berry jam,
I'm adding in my strawberries,

411
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,867
raspberries, blueberries,
and blackberries

412
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:13,267
and my mixed berry juice drink,

413
00:16:13,267 --> 00:16:17,300
powdered sugar for sweetness,
and cornstarch.

414
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,933
The cornstarch will help
to thicken my jam.

415
00:16:19,933 --> 00:16:21,833
Perfect!

416
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,167
Linsey got grape juice
as her twist, and I just --

417
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:27,367
I don't know how that's going to
work with her bologna sandwich.

418
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:29,067
Never had a bologna
and jelly sandwich?

419
00:16:29,067 --> 00:16:30,467
No.

-Think you're about to.

00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Darn it.
What do I do with grape juice?

422
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,100
I'm just so annoyed
because I get there last,

423
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:43,733
and the only juice left
is the grape juice

424
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:46,633
'cause no one else
wanted grape juice.

425
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:49,933
This will not be fun to figure
out how to use this grape juice.

426
00:16:49,933 --> 00:16:52,233
Like, I'll figure you out later

427
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:55,567
'cause whatever I'm doing
doesn't involve juice.

LUKE:
All right. Let's go.

430
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,833
So now I have to use my juice
in my imposter

431
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:00,933
so they can taste it.

432
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,500
I still haven't made
my side dish,

433
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,733
so I decide, why don't
I just make applesauce?

434
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:09,233
I'm thinking,
for the applesauce,

435
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:11,167
I'm just gonna
make it more sweet

436
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,067
and add in a lot of sugar.

437
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:14,800
This is gonna be weird.

438
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,200
And then I add apple juice.

439
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,333
Basically, it's
an applesauce imposter

440
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,233
that's like a sweet
dessert applesauce.

441
00:17:21,233 --> 00:17:23,200
[ Gasps ] I made applesauce.

443
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:28,100
That's not very good.

444
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,867
This twist is so bad.

445
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,233
Oh, my goodness.

446
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,600
At school, usually,
I would drink a juice box

with my sandwich,

448
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,233
but I wouldn't incorporate
it in the sandwich.

449
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:39,600
That would just be disgusting.

00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,167
Since I haven't made
my crêpe batter yet,

453
00:17:45,167 --> 00:17:47,167
I'm going to use
this juice in my imposter

454
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:49,567
by incorporating
it into my crêpe,

455
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,100
replacing the water
with this juice.

456
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:56,067
Strawberry lemonade crêpe,
that's not the worst thing ever.

457

Uh-oh.

00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,833
Uh-oh. It's stuck.

but it's stuck
to the bottom of the pan.

462
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,933
Did not work. Oh, my god.

463
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:09,567

I wonder what's faux lunch.

Oh, thank god.

486

Okay. There we go.

487
00:19:06,533 --> 00:19:09,933
So for my "ham," I am taking
the strawberry lemonade crêpe,

488
00:19:09,933 --> 00:19:12,967
and then I'm airbrushing it
kind of like an orange.

What's Alex airbrushing?

490
00:19:14,233 --> 00:19:15,800
I don't know. It's orange.

491
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,567
What's supposed to be orange
in a ham and cheese sandwich?

492
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,233
The cheese?

493
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:21,600
Okay. Perfect.

495
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,067
For my side dish,
I'm doing cinnamon apple chips

496
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,767
to look like potato chips.

497
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:30,233
I like apple chips because
they sort of remind me

498
00:19:30,233 --> 00:19:32,833
of potato chips
with the texture,

499
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,067
but they taste like fruit.

500
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:36,667
I've never made
apple chips before,

501
00:19:36,667 --> 00:19:39,967
so I'm just sort of
guessing here.

502
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,333
I really need to figure out
how to use this twist

503
00:19:42,333 --> 00:19:44,633
because no one
likes grape juice.

504
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,800
I think I'm gonna make,
like, a sauce with it

505
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,333
for my chips, the side dish.

506
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:54,500
I'm really hoping that this
mixed berry plus grape sauce

507
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,667
has a grape flavor
because, I mean,

508
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,733
I put the whole bag
of grape juice

509
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,367
inside of the berry mixture,

510
00:20:00,367 --> 00:20:02,833
but I'm worried that the other
berries will distract

511
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,533
from the grape flavor.

512
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:06,867
Oh, jeez.
Well, I made a mess.

513
00:20:06,867 --> 00:20:09,600
Oh, my god. They're still raw.

514
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,633
So I go to check on
my lemon pound cake.

515
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:13,500
Ugh.

516
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,533

00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,100

-Hi. What are you making?

519
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:21,733
My cakes are not baking,
so I need to put this foil

520
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:25,267
to have them bake
a little faster in the middle.

521
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,800

what you're doing.
Yeah. Okay.

improvising on the spot,

so the metal gets hot --
Yeah.

you have strong bones.

applesauce looks like,

juice, and I still need a side,

so I run to the pantry,
and I see oats,

562

and I get the idea
to make apple juice granola.

563
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,067

is I'm going to throw my oats

564

in a pot and toast
them with butter.

00:22:01,233 --> 00:22:04,367
Then I'm gonna chop up
pecans and add that.

into a separate bowl

a deconstructed granola bar.

perfect shade of green,

585

I add in some "tomatoes,"

00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:29,233
I'm gonna use the leftover
frosting that I have to make it

625
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:32,733
like a "honey mustard" dip.

626
00:24:32,733 --> 00:24:35,133
Perfecto.

627
00:24:35,133 --> 00:24:38,067
Bryn, you done?

628
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,667
-You sure?
-Yeah.

629
00:24:39,667 --> 00:24:44,900
Is there anything else you could
make that plate amazing?

630
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,300
I don't see anything wrong,

631
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,200
but I'm just gonna
keep on looking

632
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,967
so she thinks I'm doing
what she said.

633
00:24:50,967 --> 00:24:54,067
Sanding sugar or "salt."
[ Laughs ]

634
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:58,467
Ooh, delicious.

635
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,867
So I check on my cakes again.

636
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:03,533
Oh, so the top is done.

637
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,233
* Ah *

638
00:25:05,233 --> 00:25:07,733
Thank goodness they are
finally cooked.

639
00:25:07,733 --> 00:25:09,267
Hot.

640
00:25:09,267 --> 00:25:10,833
So I am cutting through
my first loaf of bread,

641
00:25:10,833 --> 00:25:12,433
and it's kind of breaking.

642
00:25:12,433 --> 00:25:15,633
When I try to cut it very thin,
it's just crumbling.

643
00:25:15,633 --> 00:25:16,967
Oh, darn it.

644
00:25:16,967 --> 00:25:19,300
So I'm just gonna cut it
a little thicker.

645
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:22,833
I think having the bread
a little thick will be okay

646
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,800
because I know that
this cake is nice and moist.

647
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,633
That's a pretty
nice looking sandwich.

648
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:29,733
90 seconds.

649
00:25:29,733 --> 00:25:31,067
Okay.

650
00:25:31,067 --> 00:25:32,300
Oh, my god.

651
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,867
It ain't easy
to imposter-ize, is it?

652
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:37,167
-No!
-Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

653
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,567
You want to be
an imposter legend.

654
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:42,133
-Yogurt.
-That's so realistic.

655
00:25:42,133 --> 00:25:45,067
DUFF AND VALERIE:

3, 2, 1, hands up!

658
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,833
-Those look really good.
-Thanks.

659
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:57,067
Way to go, bakers!

660
00:25:57,067 --> 00:26:00,333
Good job, guys.

661
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,100
Time is up, and I'm
looking at my dish

662
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,400
and thinking it looks mushy
and gross like a tuna sandwich,

663
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,100
so I guess it's a good thing.

664
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:09,500

665
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:16,267
Lunch box imposters, you know,

666
00:26:16,267 --> 00:26:17,833
I really think we put
this thing on the map.

667
00:26:17,833 --> 00:26:19,233
Oh, you betcha.

668
00:26:19,233 --> 00:26:20,433
I can't wait to see
what they've done.

669
00:26:20,433 --> 00:26:23,067
Linsey.

670
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,167
-Hi, Linsey.
-Hi.

671
00:26:24,167 --> 00:26:25,867
-How's it going?
-Good.

672
00:26:25,867 --> 00:26:27,800
All right, Linsey, what was
your lunch box imposter,

673
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,267
and what'd you make for us?

674
00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:32,967
So my lunch box imposter
was a bologna sandwich,

675
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,767
so I made for you
a lemon cake

676
00:26:35,767 --> 00:26:40,933
as the bread and coating
chocolate for the cheese.

677
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:43,933
I used marzipan for the bologna,

678
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:45,867
and I made
a white chocolate ganache

679
00:26:45,867 --> 00:26:48,500
mayonnaise inside
of the sandwich.

680
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,967
That's...

681
00:26:51,967 --> 00:26:53,333
-Yeah, that's pretty good.
-[ Laughs ]

682
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,867
-Yes.
-That looks like bologna, man.

683
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:56,967
It really does.

684
00:26:56,967 --> 00:26:58,267
Thank you.

685
00:26:58,267 --> 00:27:00,200
I will say there's
a lot of bread.

686
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,967
That's more like a hoagie.

687
00:27:02,967 --> 00:27:04,067
-Yeah.
-It's a bologna hoagie.

688
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,267
Yeah, it's a bologna hoagie.

689
00:27:05,267 --> 00:27:06,467
Let's taste it.

690
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:09,933

691
00:27:09,933 --> 00:27:12,567
-Ow.
-[ Laughs ]

692
00:27:12,567 --> 00:27:13,567
Mm.

693
00:27:13,567 --> 00:27:15,267
-I love this.
-Thank you.

694
00:27:15,267 --> 00:27:17,567
I love the lemon
and the marzipan.

695
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:20,733
I didn't realize I liked them
so much together. I do now.

696
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:24,400
I love the crunchiness on
the edges of the bread -- cake.

697
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,100
You know, it's good,
but it is really thick.

698
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,233
I almost had to unhinge
my jaw like a snake

699
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:31,267
to get my mouth around it.
-Yeah.

700
00:27:31,267 --> 00:27:32,700
So tell us about
your side dish.

701
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,633
I made chips, but they are
made of pie crusts,

702
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:38,267
and my twist juice
was grape juice,

703
00:27:38,267 --> 00:27:42,200
so I made a grape
and mixed berry sauce.

704
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,767
You know, I'm looking at these
chips, and I'm like, "Okay.

705
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:46,300
They're too thick, and there's,
you know, not enough sauce."

706
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,900
I only see a little bit of sauce
down there, and I'm like,

707
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,800
"Okay. You know, I'm gonna
have to break Linsey's heart."

708
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,200
I can't.
They're good, you know?
[ Laughs ]

709
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,833
They just taste like
I'm eating pie.

710
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,067
Can totally taste grape juice.

711
00:27:59,067 --> 00:28:01,067
Yes, taste grape juice.

712
00:28:01,067 --> 00:28:02,233
Oh, I was so nervous.
Thank you.

713
00:28:02,233 --> 00:28:04,433
-Great job.
-Thanks, Linsey.

714
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:08,967
Marzipan and lemon, delicious.

715
00:28:08,967 --> 00:28:12,333
Julia, tell us
what you made today.

716
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:14,300
I got turkey wrap,

717
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,067
and for the juice twist,
I got orange juice,

718
00:28:17,067 --> 00:28:19,467
and so for
the actual tortilla,

719
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:22,400
I did a orange flavored
crêpe batter.

720
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,367
And then for the turkey,
I did a blondie,

721
00:28:25,367 --> 00:28:28,833
and I sliced it and airbrushed
it a little bit brown.

722
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:32,400
And for the lettuce, I did
shredded coconut dyed green.

723
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,133
I love, by the way,
that you made a green crêpe

724
00:28:34,133 --> 00:28:36,433
because I love
those spinach wraps.

725
00:28:36,433 --> 00:28:39,867
Your coconut is a little
on the green, green side.

726
00:28:39,867 --> 00:28:43,667
Yeah. I feel like, if I ever got
lettuce that was that color,

727
00:28:43,667 --> 00:28:46,633
I'd be a little wary
to be eating it.

728
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:48,300
It's pretty green.
It's pretty bright.

729
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
Your blondie
is deliciously moist,

730
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,833
and I love the flavor
of your crêpe.

731
00:28:51,833 --> 00:28:54,567
I like that you put
orange in that.
Mm-hmm.

732
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,133
That's a fun way
to use the twist.

733
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:59,833
I would say that
it needs some sauce.

734
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,467
Mm.

735
00:29:01,467 --> 00:29:04,067
Because it's, like,
dry coconut in a crêpe.
Okay.

736
00:29:04,067 --> 00:29:05,933
Something to kind of
make it a little wetter.

737
00:29:05,933 --> 00:29:07,133
Tell us about your side.

738
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,267
For the side,
I did apple chips,

739
00:29:09,267 --> 00:29:11,467
and I baked them
with some cinnamon.

740
00:29:11,467 --> 00:29:13,267
Apple chips that look
like potato chips.

741
00:29:13,267 --> 00:29:14,933
They look like potato chips.

742
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:17,133
Look, even this one, being
a little bit on the burnt side,

743
00:29:17,133 --> 00:29:19,367
that looks like
a real potato chip.

744
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,067
Now, they're a little floppy.

745
00:29:21,067 --> 00:29:22,300
That's because they're apples.

746
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,567
Yeah.
They're a little soggy.

747
00:29:23,567 --> 00:29:27,133
It's not the funnest thing.
[ Coughs ]

748
00:29:27,133 --> 00:29:29,067
[ Laughs ] Too much?

749
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,800
-Yeah.
-That's a lot of cinnamon.

750
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,267
Sorry.

751
00:29:33,267 --> 00:29:34,567
Well, thank you
very much, Julia.

752
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:36,133
Thank you.

753
00:29:36,133 --> 00:29:37,867
That was a lot of cinnamon.

754
00:29:37,867 --> 00:29:40,433
It's a lot of cinnamon.

755
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:41,667
Luke?

756
00:29:41,667 --> 00:29:44,300
What did you get
for your lunch box imposter?

757
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,433
I got tuna salad sandwich.

758
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,533
-Tuna salad sandwich.
-[ Laughs ]

759
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:50,600
Can you say that
with more of a pout?

-Tuna salad sandwich.
-[ Laughs ]

761
00:29:53,167 --> 00:29:56,833
You don't like tuna salad?

-Ugh.
-[ Laughs ]

763
00:29:58,233 --> 00:30:00,467
Today, I made a tuna
salad sandwich,

764
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,433
and the bread is a white cake,

765
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:06,367
and the filling is
a coconut whipped cream

766
00:30:06,367 --> 00:30:08,700
with chopped up
coating chocolates

767
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,800
as carrots and celery,
marshmallows as,

768
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,667
like, the little chunks of tuna,

769
00:30:13,667 --> 00:30:15,933
and then, on the side,

770
00:30:15,933 --> 00:30:19,300
I made a apple juice granola.

771
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:21,567
[ Laughs ]
It almost looked
like you were going

772
00:30:21,567 --> 00:30:24,300
"apple juice granola,"
like a wink-wink.

773
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,200
What was it being
an imposter for?

774
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,967
A deconstructed granola bar

775
00:30:27,967 --> 00:30:31,633
with apple juice.

776
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:32,933
Wow.

777
00:30:32,933 --> 00:30:34,167
I feel like it's --
I don't know.

778
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:35,967
You're better than than that.

779
00:30:35,967 --> 00:30:37,500
-More inventive.
-Yeah.

780
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,100
You can make all kinds
of good stuff.

781
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,533
I feel like that's not
a dessert imposter.

782
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:44,933
This doesn't necessarily say,
"Tuna salad sandwich."

783
00:30:44,933 --> 00:30:46,533
It looks more like a, um...

784
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:49,600
Like a mayonnaise sandwich,
which are delicious.

785
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,867
[ Laughs ]

786
00:30:50,867 --> 00:30:52,533
Really?

You've never had
a mayonnaise sandwich?
Just mayonnaise?

788
00:30:54,067 --> 00:30:56,433
Mayonnaise. Yeah.
When you open the fridge,

789
00:30:56,433 --> 00:30:57,700
and there's nothing
in there but mayonnaise.

-No.
-Okay.

791
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,067
That happens sometimes.

-Wait till you're at a college.
-[ Laugsh ] Right? Yeah.

793
00:31:04,067 --> 00:31:05,600
Get to college, you'll be eating
a lot of mayonnaise sandwiches.

slice of cake

with some whipped cream in it.

796
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,667
I think you could have
definitely gone with

797
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:14,700
more of the orange
and the green chocolate.

798
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,400
The texture would've
been really great.

799
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,733
I like
the marshmallow in there.

800
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,567
I love marshmallows.

801
00:31:19,567 --> 00:31:22,200
If tuna tasted like marshmallows
I would eat a lot more tuna.
[ Laughs ]

802
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,700
-Same.
-Right?

803
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,933
-Same.
-Totally.

804
00:31:24,933 --> 00:31:26,133
Now, your granola,

805
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:28,067
I don't really taste
the apple juice,

806
00:31:28,067 --> 00:31:31,667
and I think what you probably
needed to do was reduce it,

807
00:31:31,667 --> 00:31:33,433
put it in the oven,
toast it off,

808
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,333
and then all that syrup would
make it really stick together

809
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,100
and get really crunchy,

810
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:39,633
and if you took that granola

811
00:31:39,633 --> 00:31:42,167
and folded it into
your whipped cream,

812
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:45,200
that totally would've
looked like tuna salad.

813
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,100
Totally would've looked
like tuna salad.

814
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:49,900
Oh, my goodness.
It totally would've.
Luke!

815
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,133
-Oh, man.
-Luke!

816
00:31:52,133 --> 00:31:52,967
-Thanks a lot, man.
-Thanks, Luke.

817
00:31:52,967 --> 00:31:56,300
Thank you.

818
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,933
Lots of missed
opportunities here.

819

820

821
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:09,333
The Imposter Challenge,
one of my favorites.

822
00:32:09,333 --> 00:32:11,333
Yeah. You know, it's really
a litmus test for these kids.

823
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:12,900
Oh, you betcha. Uh-huh.

824
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:15,500
Abby!

825
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,733
-Hello.
-How's it going, Chef?

826
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:19,067
Good.

827
00:32:19,067 --> 00:32:20,467
So what was your lunch
box imposter?

828
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:24,700
My lunch box imposter
was a PB&J sandwich.

829
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:29,333
I made a vanilla cake
for the bread,

830
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:33,233
pastry cream
for the peanut butter,

831
00:32:33,233 --> 00:32:35,967
and my twist juice
was mixed berry,

832
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:40,300
so a mixed berry jam
for the jelly.

833
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,667
And what's your side dish?

834
00:32:41,667 --> 00:32:46,167
My side dish
a strawberry yogurt,

835
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:49,067
which is actually
a strawberry whipped cream.

836
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,100
I love that you put
the yogurt in this.

837
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,133
It's bringing back memories
of when I used to box lunches.

838
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,800
It looks like a real
lunch box lunch.

839
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,167
Abby, this is great.

840
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:02,600
It really looks like
a PBJ, you know?

841
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:03,700
Really creative.

842
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,067
So it's pastry cream.

843
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,467
I'm gonna be thinking I'm
eating a peanut butter sandwich,

844
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:07,533
but I'm not.

845
00:33:07,533 --> 00:33:11,633
**

846
00:33:11,633 --> 00:33:12,700
Huh.

847
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,067
You know, Abby,
sometimes when bakers

848
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,667
are making dessert imposters,

849
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,200
you know, they focus
so much on the visual

850
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,767
that sometimes they forget
to make it good,

851
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:23,967
you know, to make it actually
something you want to eat,

852
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:27,067
and that is not the case.

853
00:33:27,067 --> 00:33:28,633
This is really good.

854
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:32,333
The -- I want to say,
"Bread," but it's cake.

855
00:33:32,333 --> 00:33:34,233
The cake is super moist.

856
00:33:34,233 --> 00:33:35,600
I can really taste your twist.

857
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,233
You know, I can taste
your mixed berry juice

858
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:38,533
that you got in your juice box.

859
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,500
And it's the pastry
cream in there

860
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,467
that really puts it
all together.

861
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:45,067
I'm gonna have a little
bit of your yogurt.

862
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:47,333
Yogurt.

863
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:50,167
That is some yummy
whipped cream.

864
00:33:50,167 --> 00:33:52,600
Big chunks of berry in there
add the tartness,

865
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,533
and then the sweetness
of the cream.

866
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:57,367
Yeah. I mean, it is.
It's good.

867
00:33:57,367 --> 00:34:00,067
It's also really simple,
whipped cream

868
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,333
with some strawberries in it.

869
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,367
But yet, it's so delicious.

870
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,233
I want to slather that all
over the sandwich

871
00:34:06,233 --> 00:34:08,933
and just stuff it in my face.

872
00:34:08,933 --> 00:34:09,900
-Thanks, Abby.
-Thank you.

873
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:13,267
Thanks, Abby.

874
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:15,400
I just feel like Abby played it
safe with her side dish.

875
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,067
She didn't stretch herself,
but she also gave us

876
00:34:18,067 --> 00:34:20,500
a really lovely tasting dish.
-Sure.

Hey, Bryn, come on in.

That is the smile
of somebody who thinks

880
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,167
they did a pretty good job.

[ Laughter ]

882
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:34,267
Okay. So, Bryn, what was
your lunch box imposter?

883
00:34:34,267 --> 00:34:38,200
My lunch box imposter
was chicken nuggets.

884
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,567
I made the chicken nuggets
like cake balls

885
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:44,533
by crumbling up
some of my vanilla cake,

886
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:47,233
and then I took some
passionfruit buttercream

887
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,467
and put that into it.

888
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:49,767
And that was your
twist ingredient?

889
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,400
Yes.

890
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,333
I took mixed cereal and just
coated the outside a little.

891
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:57,467
My side dish is sugar
cookie French fries.

892
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:58,800
Oh, nice.

893
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,133
What's this?

894
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:02,433
Passionfruit buttercream,
honey mustard.

895
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:06,433
You know what I love about this?
The sanding sugar salt.

896
00:35:06,433 --> 00:35:07,767
-Yes. It sparkles.
-Right?

897
00:35:07,767 --> 00:35:09,333
It's perfect.

898
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:14,800
Now, these nuggets they look
95% amazing.

899
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,167
They're really good,
but they're a little blond.

900
00:35:18,167 --> 00:35:20,867
They look like if I got them
from the grocery store

901
00:35:20,867 --> 00:35:22,467
in the frozen food section,

902
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:24,600
right before
I put them in the fryer.

903
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:27,067
I think maybe even if you just
colored some of that cereal

904
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,867
a little darker before
you made the nuggets.

905
00:35:28,867 --> 00:35:30,300
-Let's taste it.
-All right.

906
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,567
It even looks like chicken
nuggets on the inside.

907
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,267
-[ Laughs ]
-[ Laughs ] Look at that.

908
00:35:35,267 --> 00:35:36,800
Totally tasting
the passionfruit.

909
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:37,933
Oh, thank you.

910
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,367
Totally tasting
the passionfruit.

911
00:35:39,367 --> 00:35:42,633
That cake is moist,
perfect little bit of cake

912
00:35:42,633 --> 00:35:43,900
and cream and crunch.

913
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,233
Thank you.

914
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,067
These sugar cookies,
by the way, delish.

915
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,667
-Thank you.
-Really delicious.

916
00:35:48,667 --> 00:35:50,533
They're perfectly baked.

917
00:35:50,533 --> 00:35:52,867
These cookies are a bit...
They're all right.

918
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,133
I like them.

919
00:35:54,133 --> 00:35:55,200
I could've used a little
more excitement,

920
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,633
I think, in the flavor,

921
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,733
and you know what would've
made them really amazing?

922
00:35:58,733 --> 00:36:00,600
An egg wash because right now,

923
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,833
they look like
uncooked potatoes.

924
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:05,633
I would've liked to have seen
all your food cooked up.

925
00:36:05,633 --> 00:36:06,833
-Thanks, Bryn.
-Thanks, Bryn.

926
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,900
Thank you.

927
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,367
I feel like Bryn was so close

928
00:36:12,367 --> 00:36:14,267
to being a
food imposter legend.

929
00:36:14,267 --> 00:36:15,433
-Yep.
-I mean, these are really great.

930
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:17,233
They're beautiful.
Beautiful.

931
00:36:17,233 --> 00:36:20,700
They're just the wrong color.

932
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,533
Alex!

933
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:25,367
I think being called in
for judging

934
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:27,600
is almost like going
to the principal's office.

935
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:29,067
It so scary.

936
00:36:29,067 --> 00:36:32,067
So tell us what you got today
and how you made it for us.

937
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:35,533
So today I got a ham and cheese
sandwich, so as the bread,

938
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:38,067
I did a lemon pound cake,
and then for the ham,

939
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:40,067
I did a strawberry
lemonade crepe.

940
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:43,300
As the cheese, I did white
chocolate, which I dyed orange,

941
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,867
and then I put some
strawberries as the tomatoes.

942
00:36:45,867 --> 00:36:47,233
Oh, lovely.

943
00:36:47,233 --> 00:36:49,600
I think the bread,
it's really thick.

944
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:52,467
Usually with a sandwich,
I like lots of bread, so...

945
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:54,567
Because if you look at me,
I need the carbs, right?

946
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:57,400
[ Laughs ]

947
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,333
Okay, Alex, whatever you say.
You're so adorable.

948
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:02,133
What was your juice twist?

949
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:04,200
My juice twist was
the strawberry lemonade,

950
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,100
so I put it in my crêpe.

951
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,900
-For the ham?
-Yep.

952
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,300
Well, look at that. Yeah.

953
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,967
My ham is never
quite this orange.

954
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:13,767
Why didn't you use pink?

955
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:15,233
Oh, yeah.
That would work.

956
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,933
I think orange ham
would make me sick.

957
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:22,900
Okay. Here goes nothing.

958
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:25,533
Here is what's great about it,
the strawberry

959
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:26,533
and the chocolate,

960
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,200
when you crunch into
both of them together,

961
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,667
it tastes like
a chocolate-covered strawberry.

962
00:37:29,667 --> 00:37:30,900
Ooh.

963
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,400
I didn't really taste
the lemonade.

964
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,600
Oh.

965
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,267
I think if you reduced it
and made it really strong

966
00:37:37,267 --> 00:37:38,467
and then used that
in your crêpe,

967
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:39,800
you probably would've tasted it.

968
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,267
What did you make for your side?

969
00:37:41,267 --> 00:37:43,400
So my side is a Caesar salad.

970
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,733
I did coconut flakes,

[ Indistinct conversations ]

68
00:02:49,967 --> 00:02:51,933
I got dried mango.

69
00:02:51,933 --> 00:02:53,700
I got dried apricots.

70
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,067
I got dried peaches.

71
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:57,467
I'm the last boy standing.

72
00:02:57,467 --> 00:02:58,967
I really want to represent
the boys

73
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:01,067
and make it to the finale.

74
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:05,067
Also, I'm representing Canada,
so there's a lot riding on this.

75
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:06,433
Mix that all together.

76
00:03:06,433 --> 00:03:08,300
I know the universe is huge,

77
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,733
and I want to make
something that's big,

78
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,433
so I'm thinking a cake.

79
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:14,333
I am making a vanilla
tie-dye cake with

80
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:17,200
a dried peach
crème pâtissière filling

81
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,467
and American
buttercream frosting.

82
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,800
The first thing
I'm gonna work on

83
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,067
is my vanilla tie-dye cake.

84
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,867
It's a massive batch
of cake batter.

85
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:28,633
I think I'm taking a risk
with this tie-dye cake

86
00:03:28,633 --> 00:03:30,133
because, in week six,

87
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:32,200
I got a lot of criticism
from the judges.

00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,267
My tie-dye unicorn cake.

89
00:03:35,267 --> 00:03:36,667
It is a little overbaked.

90
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,200
-Oh, okay.
-It's a little on the dry side.

91
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,633
I'm looking for redemption.

92
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:44,100
Bryn, if you were
to visit any planet,

93
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,333
which planet would you
want to visit?

94
00:03:46,333 --> 00:03:48,333
Maybe Mars
because that's, like,

95
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:51,233
since they're kind of trying
to get there, it's pretty cool.

96
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,467
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

97
00:03:52,467 --> 00:03:54,067
When my batter's complete,

98
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,667
I color one blue, pink,
and purple

99
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,133
with gel food coloring.

100
00:03:58,133 --> 00:04:01,100
Do I see Alex making
a tie-dyed cake?

101
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,767
It's a great idea.

102
00:04:02,767 --> 00:04:07,067
I don't know how I feel about
him doing a tie-dye cake again.

103
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:09,667
Well, he had room
for improvement.

104
00:04:09,667 --> 00:04:11,333
We'll see how it tastes.

105
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:13,300
I think these colors
look like space.

106
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,067
I swirl it around
with a toothpick

107
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:17,100
until it's like a galaxy.

00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,067
Next week is the semifinals.

00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,500
Only four people
are gonna be left,

00:04:23,933 --> 00:04:26,100
My cakes look like
a galactic soup.

00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,367
The big bang theory
didn't come yet,

113
00:04:27,367 --> 00:04:30,867
so it just needs to get baked.

114
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:32,700

00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,600
I have never had mango before.

120
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,833
That is gross.

121
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:49,667
I don't know if I ever
will want to again.

122
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:51,367
Abby just tried her
freeze-dried mango.

123
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:53,467
I don't think she likes it.

00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:58,067
I'm going to make a mango cake
pop and dip my cake pops

125
00:04:58,067 --> 00:05:00,633
in different colored
white chocolate,

126
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,967
and that's gonna
look like a galaxy.

127
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,500
Cake pops are one
of my specialties,

128
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,300
so I'm very confident
in this challenge.

129
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,433
First, I get started
on my mango cake batter.

130
00:05:12,433 --> 00:05:15,333
I'm going to process my mangos

131
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:19,500
and then add them in as some
of my flour into my cake,

132
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,067
and I'm also gonna
make a mango buttercream.

133
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:24,267
Oh, that smells really bad.

134
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:26,433
Hopefully, Duff and Valerie
like mango

00:05:26,433 --> 00:05:29,700
'cause, if they don't, they are
not gonna like this cake.

00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,133
Bake, baby, bake.

137
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:32,800
Bake, bake, bake.

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,400
To make my mango buttercream,

139
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,700
I'm creaming together
butter and shortening,

140
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:40,867
and then I'm adding
in my powdered sugar

141
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:43,733
and some mango purée.

142
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:46,633
The judges can't tell me
it doesn't taste like mango.

143
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:48,667
Oh, you're making
cake pops, Abby?

144
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:50,867

a planet anymore?

00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:09,200
Yeah, but, like, it was,
and then it wasn't.

-It's a planet.
-Okay.

155
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,800
The space part of science
is really cool.

156
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,800
I like Pluto even though it's
not "considered" a planet now.

157
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,067
It's really small and tiny,
but I get bananas.

158
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,633
They smell weird.

159
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:25,567
I'd rather eat, like, a regular
banana than a dried banana.

160
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:27,067
Okay.

161
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:30,400
I decided to make cupcakes
because they're fast to cook,

162
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,667
and I'll have time
to decorate them.

163
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:35,700
I'm going to turn them into
intergalactic cupcakes

00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,533

-Hello.
-What's going on?

00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,700
I got dried banana,
and I have fresh

168

and dried bananas
in my cake batter,

169
00:06:45,333 --> 00:06:48,067
and I'm gonna pipe
out, like, a planet

170
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,467
and, like,
a little rocket ship.

171
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:52,800
How bad do you want to be
the Kids Baking Champion?

172
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,067
So bad because I want to buy
myself a Labradoodle

173
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,367
and name it Snickerdoodle

174
00:06:57,367 --> 00:06:59,700
and then some towards
my baking business.

175
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,233
I love it all.

176
00:07:01,233 --> 00:07:03,567
When I put the freeze-dried
bananas in my batter,

177
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:06,933
it'll kind of turn back
into a "regular banana"

178
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:10,067
because it'll kind of hydrate
itself in the cake batter.

179
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:12,067
This actually looks good.

180
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:13,867
Make sure you taste.

181
00:07:13,867 --> 00:07:18,333
Get some of that banana.

182
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,300
Ooh. It tastes good.

183
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:23,200
I get them into the cupcake pans
with a silver liner

184
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,400
and get them in the oven.

185
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,433
Oh, hot.

186
00:07:27,433 --> 00:07:30,533
For my frosting, I separate it
into three bowls,

187
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,867
color one purple

188
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,933
and then the other teal
and then another one black.

189
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:38,167
I want my intergalactic
frosting to stand out.

190
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,433
Looking good.

191
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:40,867
All right.

[ Laughs ]

195
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,700
Mm. Oh, that smells
like strawberries.

196
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,867
I have not had dried
strawberries before,

197
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:56,200
but I have had, like,
dried fruit before,

198
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:59,067
so I kind of know
how they work.

199
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:03,567
So my inspiration for this
dessert is my love for galaxies

200
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:06,300
because I'm, like,
in love with it,

201
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,067
so I'm making
a strawberry sugar cookie

with a royal icing decoration.

203
00:08:13,467 --> 00:08:15,833
I decided on this
because I think a cookie

204
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,567
is a great canvas
for making a galaxy design,

205
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:21,333
and I also can just
grind up the strawberry

206
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,367
and use it as a dry
ingredient in the cookie.

207
00:08:23,367 --> 00:08:25,500
Some natural pigment here.

208
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,533
So I start by making
my strawberry sugar cookie.

209
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:30,433
I take my freeze-dried
strawberries,

210
00:08:30,433 --> 00:08:34,300
put them in a food processor
so it turns into a powder,

211
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,567
take it out,
and it just poofs everywhere,

212
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:40,133
and I inhale it,
and I'm, like, coughing.

213
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:41,600
Oh, in my lungs.

214
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,700
Does that mean my breath
smells like strawberry?

215
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:49,333
So I add some of my strawberry
powder into the dry ingredients.

216
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:51,600
It's really, like,
a really strawberry flavor.

217
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
Everywhere, it just smells
like strawberry.

218
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:57,567
-It's a pink powder.
-I know. My dough is pink.

219
00:08:57,567 --> 00:09:01,933
I roll the dough out,
use a cookie cutter

220
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:05,833
to cut my shapes, into the oven.

221
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,400
Time to make some royal icing.

222
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,767
Royal icing is simply egg whites

223
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,133
and powdered sugar
and once it hardens,

224
00:09:13,133 --> 00:09:15,867
and it's also a great
canvas for cool designs.

225
00:09:15,867 --> 00:09:19,933
Put some food coloring
in and dye it black, blue,

226
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:21,333
purple, and pink.

227
00:09:21,333 --> 00:09:23,100
Those colors are, like,
the classic colors

228
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,767
of the space galaxy.

229
00:09:24,767 --> 00:09:26,133
I don't really like
strawberries, so...

230
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,367
You don't like strawberries?

231
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,400
It's, like, not as sweet
as you expect,

232
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,067
so then I feel like
strawberries, for me,

233
00:09:31,067 --> 00:09:32,900
are like a bunch
of disappointments.

234
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,700
It's so sweet.

intergalactic dessert.

241
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:50,867
I'm doing cream puffs filled
with apricot pastry cream --
Okay.

242
00:09:50,867 --> 00:09:54,933
...and, like, a galaxy
white chocolate ganache on top.

243
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:56,167
-Super spacey.
-Yeah.

244
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,767
Do you like space?

245
00:09:57,767 --> 00:10:00,867
I used to, like, a lot a year
ago, but then I started baking.

246
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:01,967
-Mm-hmm.
-So...

247
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:03,367
Probably not a lot
of pink in space.

248
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:05,033
I think some of those
nebulas could be.

249
00:10:05,033 --> 00:10:06,633
There's pink stars.

250
00:10:06,633 --> 00:10:09,267
Maybe there's more pink than
we're giving space credit for.

251
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:10,933
To make my pâte à choux
dough, first,

252
00:10:10,933 --> 00:10:12,367
I get started on heating

253
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:15,567
together water, butter,
and salt.

254
00:10:15,567 --> 00:10:17,467
The butter mixture
is coming to a boil,

255
00:10:17,467 --> 00:10:20,633
so I slowly add in my flour.

256
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,467
Now that my dough mixture
looks like

257
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:24,500
it's pulling away
from the sides of the pan,

258
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,333
I beat it, and I'm piping it
onto a greased baking sheet.

259
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,167
Brushing my pâte à choux
with egg wash

260
00:10:31,167 --> 00:10:33,233
will give it a nice
golden brown color.

261
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,533
Ooh, we haven't seen
pâte à choux yet.

262
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:36,433
-Mm-hmm.
-This is exciting.

263
00:10:36,433 --> 00:10:38,367
I know that the judges
see pâte à choux

264
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:40,700
as a pretty difficult
thing to make,

265
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,900
so I really want to show them
that I can do it right.

266
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,733
Going in the oven!

267
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:48,600
90 minutes left, bakers.

268
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:53,000
We want you to make
desserts and beyond.

269
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,067
To make my apricot pastry cream,

270
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,867
I first get started
on whisking together

271
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,800
the milk, sugar,
and vanilla bean

272
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
in a sauce pan over medium heat,

273
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,900
so I'm hoping that adding
the dried apricot to the milk

274
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,367
will get the flavor in there.

275
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,700
In a separate bowl,
I whisk together milk,

276
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,067
cornstarch to thicken it,
and egg yolks.

277
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:15,300
I need to strain this
apricot and vanilla steeped milk

278
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,633
so I can slowly add it
into the egg yolks.

279
00:11:18,633 --> 00:11:20,367
Oh, my god.

280
00:11:20,367 --> 00:11:22,967
And it looks like water,
chunky water.

281
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:25,067
Oh, my god.

282
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:27,133
I have no idea
why this happened.

283
00:11:27,133 --> 00:11:29,100
Looks like water, and I don't
think that's what pastry cream

284
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,500
is supposed to look like,

285
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,833
and that's, like,
the entire dish.

286
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:36,733
Cream puffs aren't cream puffs
without pastry cream.

287
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:40,533
Like, it would just be puffs,
so this needs to work.

288
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,600
Come on.

289
00:11:44,467 --> 00:11:49,067
**

290
00:11:49,067 --> 00:11:51,200
Oh, my god.

291
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,233
It looks like chunky water.

292
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:54,667
Hour and 20 minutes, guys.

293
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,833
Intergalactic desserts,
blow our minds!

294
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,300
Come on.

295
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:01,933
All right. Julia is making
a pastry cream, I think,

296
00:12:01,933 --> 00:12:07,467
and now she's got this weird,
broken apricot milk water.

297
00:12:07,467 --> 00:12:09,900
Ugh.

298
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,933
Mm.

299
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,133
Ew.

300
00:12:12,133 --> 00:12:14,467
Really?
This can't be happening.

301
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:17,700
These are dried apricots,
so I guess that it, like,

302
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,333
absorbed the milk
and just left water.

303
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:24,600
I have a good idea now.
I really have to restart fast.

304
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,767
I've done vanilla
pastry cream a lot,

305
00:12:26,767 --> 00:12:29,100
so I'm going to skip
the apricots in it

306
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,833
and go with what I know.

307
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:33,800
Once my milk mixture is boiling,
I'm straining it,

308
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,700
and it looks perfect.

309
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:36,900
Oh, that's better.

310
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,067
Phew.

311
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,833
This is a huge relief.

312
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,067
I slowly whisk that into
my egg-yolk mixture

313
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:45,267
and cooking it
until it thickens.

314
00:12:45,267 --> 00:12:48,567
I take some leftover apricot
powder that I made,

315
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,633
and I'm putting that into
my finished pastry cream.

316
00:12:51,633 --> 00:12:55,967
Now I can move on to every
other thing I have to make.

317
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,800
My cream puffs look perfect.

318
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,733
I'm at least happy
that something worked out.

319
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,067
Hey, Duff, you know
what my favorite star is?

320
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,633
Sirius.

321
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,267
Yeah, I'm serious.

322
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,067
The Sun! What?

323
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,300
-The Sun rules.
-Yeah.

324
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:13,733
Bakers, can we have
your attention, please?

325
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:15,367
-What?
-Oh, my god.

326
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:18,667
You must also make
an edible Sun --

327
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,067
Sun?

328
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:22,100
...to go with your
intergalactic desserts.

329
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,233
[ Laughs ]

330
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:26,467
-I think Bryn's happy.
-What?

331
00:13:26,467 --> 00:13:30,433
I'm pretty happy about this
twist because I love the Sun.

332
00:13:30,433 --> 00:13:33,967
You cannot use fondant
or gum paste.

333
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:35,333
Okay.

334
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:38,067
Like, really edible,
not just semiedible.

335
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,733
That would be way too easy.

336
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:42,333
I'm really crunched for time
on these cake pops,

337
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:46,367
and now I have to make
a edible Sun to go with them?

338
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,367
Let's see what you got, bakers.

339
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:50,400
Who has the marshmallows?

340
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,467
I am feeling pretty
good on time,

341
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:55,967
so I decide to make my sun now.

342
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:58,733
Julia, can I have
the rice cereal?

343
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:00,367
Yeah.

344
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,600
For my Sun, I'm going to
make a rice cereal treat ball,

345
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,233
cover it in yellow
coating chocolate.

346
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:08,100
I'm gonna make mine different
by making the eyes

347
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,767
'cause it's a cute Sun.

348
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,533
It's a happy Sun.

349
00:14:11,533 --> 00:14:13,067
Then, for the rays,

350
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:16,267
I'm gonna make little streaks
of yellow coating chocolate.

351
00:14:16,267 --> 00:14:17,733
It's kind of like you blob it

352
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:21,700
and then spread it
and blob and spread.

353
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,767
Hey, Val.

354
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:25,267
Why don't aliens eat clowns?

355
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:27,400
I don't know. Why?

356
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,167
-'Cause it tastes funny.

-Hi, Abby.
-Hello.

-I do not like it.

-Why?
-It's, like, too citrusy.

361
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,500
Yeah, I know.

You're the queen of lemons,
but I just --

363
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,433
I don't know.
I don't really like citrus.

364
00:14:46,433 --> 00:14:48,200
What are you gonna do
for the twist?

365
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,100
I'm going to make
a rice cereal Sun.

366
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:54,533
I'm going to dip it
in coating chocolate.
That sounds great.

367
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:56,667
But I'll figure that out later.

368
00:14:56,667 --> 00:14:58,233
Crumbles.

369
00:14:58,233 --> 00:15:00,333
I'm taking my cooled cake

370
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,400
and putting it into
the food processor.

371
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,067
Hmm, it's already pretty moist.

372
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:10,267
I don't know.

373
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:14,400
I am food processing it together
with my mango buttercream

374
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:18,067
because then the cake pops
will hold their shape more.

375
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:20,067
Oh, perfect. Okay.

376
00:15:20,067 --> 00:15:22,933
I'm scooping out my cake crumbs
with a cookie scooper.

377
00:15:22,933 --> 00:15:26,700
That way, all of my cake balls
will be exact same size.

378
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,600
Are you going to be using all
of the black coating chocolate?

379
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,333
No, you can have it.

380
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,900
I'm melting my black
coating chocolate

381
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:38,400
so I can use a lollipop stick
and dip it in the chocolate

382
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,433
and then stick it
into the cake ball

383
00:15:41,433 --> 00:15:45,067
so that they will not
fall off of the stick.

on this crème pâtissière

was still in there.

Okay.

I have my milk on the stove,

403
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,233
which I'm going to infuse
with my dried peaches.

404
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:29,367
When that's boiling, I will
actually temper it

405
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,200
with some eggs and cornstarch.

00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,967

It's overflowing.

have to work with it.

00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,767
I don't know why
it's scrambling on me.

415
00:16:54,767 --> 00:16:56,933
This crème pâtissière
has to come together.

416
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:59,333
This is part of my cake.

417
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,700
I'm just gonna strain it,
see what happens.

418
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,333
You know what?
I'll put it through a sieve.

419
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,300
I want to make sure
that there's no clumps,

420
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,700
and I think it's working.

421
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,400
I guess my mind was playing
tricks on me,

422
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,333
and then I have to fold
in my heavy cream.

423
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,167
DUFF: Okay.
Alex is focused right now.

424
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:16,133
It's good. I like it.

425
00:17:16,133 --> 00:17:17,633
VALERIE: Mm-hmm.

426
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:20,133
Looks like he's got
everything under control.

427
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:21,967
Yeah, it's like his brain
is very loud.

428
00:17:21,967 --> 00:17:23,433
Yeah. Uh-huh.

429
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,233
He's just thinking it through,
thinking it through.

430
00:17:25,233 --> 00:17:27,733
I just mixed that up,
and then it looked okay.

431
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:30,200
Magic.

432
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,767
Then I get started
on my buttercream.

433
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,633
I separate my buttercream
into three bowls.

434
00:17:34,633 --> 00:17:36,400
One I just leave white.

435
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,367
One I color pink, and the other
I color like a darker blue.

436
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,900
-50 minutes left, bakers!
-Oh, my god.

437
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,067
God, I have so much to do.

438
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,833
I have to take a chill pill.

439
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,400
I don't even know
if I can finish.

440

441
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,167
Duff, what are you doing?

442
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,600
Just playing with the ball.

443
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,367
Okay.

444
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,833
Oh.

445
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:01,500
I think Duff's head kind of
looks like another planet.

00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,867
[ Laughs ]

447
00:18:03,867 --> 00:18:06,067
Abby, can I borrow some
of your candy melt colors?

448
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,733
Yes.

449
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,633
I start working on my Sun
with no fondant or gum paste.

451
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,967
Okay. Thank you.

452
00:18:15,967 --> 00:18:17,733
It's not the best thing,

453
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,633
but that's what rice cereal
treats are for.

454
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:21,767
Whoopsies.

455
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:23,933
I may have spilled
all over the place.

456
00:18:23,933 --> 00:18:26,800
I put them into sphere molds,

457
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,867
and I get that into
the blast chiller.

458
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:32,067
While that's happening,
I prepare my coating chocolate.

459
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,400
I mix together some yellow
and some orange.

460
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,467
Then, once my rice cereal
treat is done,

461
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:40,567
I'm trying to spread
the coating chocolate

462
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:43,633
all over the rice cereal treat,
but it's really hard.

463
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,700
It's taking too much time,

464
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,400
so I just gave up
and took the whole thing

465
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,767
and put it in the bowl.

466
00:18:47,767 --> 00:18:50,933
It's kind of messy.

467
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:53,467
-Hi.
-How's it going, Linsey?

468
00:18:53,467 --> 00:18:54,467
Pretty good.

469
00:18:54,467 --> 00:18:55,900
What do you really love
about space?

470
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,400
I don't know.

471
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,900
It's just it's so big,
and you don't know what's --

-All right.
-Go, go, go.

00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
-Ah.
-Good luck, Linsey.

475
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:03,633
Thank you.

476
00:19:03,633 --> 00:19:05,100
It smells like strawberries.

477
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:07,233
That did not turn out how I
wanted it to, but that's okay.

478
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,100
Edges are a little bit
too brown.

479
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,933
I overbaked these.

480
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:13,067
Uh-oh.

481
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:15,833
These cookies are not serveable.

482
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,333
They're not soft
in the center at all.

483
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,467
They need to be at least
a little bit soft in the center,

484
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:21,600
so I'm like,
"What am I gonna do?"

485
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,733
Do I have time
to make another batch?

486
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:25,700
Ugh.

487
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,067
At this point in
the competition,

488
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:30,733
I cannot serve an overbaked
cookie to Duff and Valerie.

489
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,067
That just won't work.

490
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:34,300
All right.

494
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:48,067
I overbaked these.

495
00:19:48,067 --> 00:19:51,200
These cookies are not serveable.

496
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,067
Oops, Linsey's cookies
are a little brown.

497
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:56,067
It looks like space bologna.

498
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:58,067
They're overbaked.
I don't know why.

499
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,367
Do you think I have time
to bake more?

500
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:01,167
It only takes
10 minutes to bake.

501
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,100
If it only takes
10 minutes, then yeah.

502
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,567
Okay. I'm going to.

503
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:06,633
I'm going to take the risk
and try and bake

504
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:09,167
a new batch of cookies
for less time in the oven

505
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:11,133
because I need these
to be perfect.

I mean, I'm trying to get
into the semifinals.

507
00:20:13,467 --> 00:20:15,300
I always make extra batter
just in case

00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,467
for a time like this,

00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:28,267
Thank you.

513
00:20:28,267 --> 00:20:30,133
For my intergalactic design,

514
00:20:30,133 --> 00:20:32,533
you can put three bags
into one bag

515
00:20:32,533 --> 00:20:36,700
so it looks like it's all mixed
together and galaxy,

516
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,267
but I can't fit
the blue in there,

517
00:20:38,267 --> 00:20:40,400
so I'm just going to have
to take that one out

518
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,067
and just do black and purple.

519
00:20:43,067 --> 00:20:44,367
Come on, purple.

520
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:47,267
I frost little dollops
on each cupcake

521
00:20:47,267 --> 00:20:51,033
and decorate them with
luster dust and white pearls.

522
00:20:51,033 --> 00:20:55,567
I make my rocket ships by taking
black and red coating chocolate.

523
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:59,133
Then, for my black, I make
little V shapes on the bottom,

524
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,400
and for my red,
I make little ovals.

525
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,067
They're rocket ships.

526
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:06,900
For the planets, I just make
a circle and then a line across.

527
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,500

in my blast chiller,

the judges don't mind

if there's a indent in it.

00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:36,767
I'm drizzling blue
coating chocolate

00:21:36,767 --> 00:21:38,467
and pink coating chocolate

543
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,433
on top of my black
coating chocolate

544
00:21:40,433 --> 00:21:42,667
so, that way, I can create
a marble effect

for my cake pops.

546
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,067
If you stick it in Styrofoam,

547
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,067
then all the chocolate
melts down,

548
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:50,067
and you don't have
a ring at the top.

Now my Sun.

00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,300
I'm going to make
rice cereal treats

555
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,067
and mold them into a ball.

556
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:11,600
How do you get the cereal treats
to not stick to your hands?

Use the spray and, like,
spray it on you.

00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:18,133
I'm going to coat them
in yellow coating chocolate.

I'm really worried.

It is really important to do
well in this challenge

569
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
because this bake determines

570
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,067
who is going to make it
into the semifinals.

Okay. An edible Sun?
That's fine.

00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:57,067
But no fondant or gum paste?

576
00:22:57,067 --> 00:22:59,700
That was my go-to plan.

577
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:03,233
I see in the pantry that
there's sphere molds,

578
00:23:03,233 --> 00:23:06,267
so I'm gonna use
the molds to make a 3D Sun

out of my cereal treats

I'm using some orange sprinkles,

582
00:23:12,133 --> 00:23:15,867
and I'm putting that on top of
my Sun to give it that flair.

583
00:23:15,867 --> 00:23:19,600
I really want to win because,
with the $25,000,

584
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,800
I'd buy this huge cat
stuffed animal.

I love stuffed animals.

00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,167
Why'd the Sun
go to school, Duff?

587
00:23:27,167 --> 00:23:31,200
Why did the Sun go to school?

588
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,133
To get brighter.

589
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,833
They look a tiny bit better,
not quite.

590
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:41,467
Intergalactic-themed things
in general have, like,

591
00:23:41,467 --> 00:23:43,533
a bunch of colors
that just swirl together,

592
00:23:43,533 --> 00:23:47,067
pretty and irregular
and beautiful,

593
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,767
so I'm using black
as a background

594
00:23:48,767 --> 00:23:52,133
because that's, like, the main
color of, like, space galaxies.

595
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,467
Then I take my blue,
pink, purple

596
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:56,567
and make some swirls on top.

597
00:23:56,567 --> 00:24:00,967
Then I use a toothpick, and I
drag all of the icing around

598
00:24:00,967 --> 00:24:05,067
so it's a nice marbled design.

599
00:24:05,067 --> 00:24:06,400
Linsey, how you doing
over there?

600
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,467
I'm going as fast as I can.

601
00:24:08,467 --> 00:24:09,700
13 minutes left.

602
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,133
Final touches, I'm using
some peppermint extract

603
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,567
and luster dust,

604
00:24:13,567 --> 00:24:15,767
mix them together
to create, like, a paint.

605
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:18,733
Then I put it on a paintbrush,
and I flick the paintbrush

606
00:24:18,733 --> 00:24:21,567
so the paint splatters
onto the cookie,

607
00:24:21,567 --> 00:24:24,300
creating, like,
nice scattered star effect.

608
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,533
I think these cookies
are out of this world.

609
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,967
Pretty sure some got in my eye,
but that's okay.

610
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:32,533
And I also put it on the Sun,
and now my Sun looks golden,

611
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:35,667
and it's glowing
like an actual sun.

612
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,167
Alex, how are you doing?

613
00:24:37,167 --> 00:24:39,900
I'm a little behind schedule.

614
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:42,333
This twist is terrible
because I've had some issues.

615
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:44,933
I don't know if I'm gonna
get everything done.

616
00:24:44,933 --> 00:24:46,633
Ugh!

617
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:48,667
I'm gonna make my edible Sun
by cutting the top of my cakes,

618
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:51,300
and then I'm gonna use
those crumbled pieces,

619
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:53,200
and then I'm gonna
put in some buttercream

620
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,767
and make, like,
a giant cake pop.

621
00:24:55,767 --> 00:24:57,867
I need to speed up.

622
00:24:57,867 --> 00:24:59,500
Let's wrap this thing.

623
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,067
And then I cover it in fondant.

624
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,667
I draw some eyes.

625
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,100
I wonder what Alex is doing with
a big block of yellow fondant.

626
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,367
Oh, okay.

627
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:11,233
Okay.

628
00:25:11,233 --> 00:25:14,867
I forgot I can't use fondant
on this Sun.

629
00:25:14,867 --> 00:25:16,167
Oh, my god.

630
00:25:16,167 --> 00:25:17,400
What am I thinking?

631
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,067
Duff said I cannot use fondant.

632
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:22,467
Ugh!
I just wasted so much time.

633
00:25:22,467 --> 00:25:24,567
I'm a pretty bad
listener sometimes.

634
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,133
Okay.

635
00:25:26,133 --> 00:25:29,533
Okay. Oh, my god.

636
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:35,167
**

637
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:36,533
-This one --
-Thank you.

638
00:25:36,533 --> 00:25:39,267
You got five minutes
to get to outer space.

639
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:43,767
Intergalactic desserts
with an edible Sun,

640
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,367
no fondant, no gum paste.

641
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:49,833
I wonder what Alex is doing with
a big block of yellow fondant.

642
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:50,933
Oh, okay.

643
00:25:50,933 --> 00:25:52,067
What am I thinking?

644
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,633
I cannot use fondant.

645
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:54,933
Ugh!

646
00:25:54,933 --> 00:25:56,733
This is costing me so much time.

647
00:25:56,733 --> 00:25:57,800
Oh.

648
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,933
I have a lot to do still.

649
00:25:58,933 --> 00:26:00,467
I need a miracle right now.

650
00:26:00,467 --> 00:26:02,067
Does anyone have
the yellow or...

651
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:03,533
The yellow what?

652
00:26:03,533 --> 00:26:06,267
Does anybody have
the yellow coating chocolate?

653
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:07,800
Yes...

654
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,367
I decide I'm just going to cover
it in melted coating chocolate,

655
00:26:10,367 --> 00:26:12,800
and then maybe I'm just gonna
roll it in some sprinkles.

656
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,067
I have to finish.

657
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:16,433
I think, to me,
it looks like a Sun

658
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,533
that has been beat up
a little bit.

659
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,967
The Sun is pretty old.

660
00:26:19,967 --> 00:26:22,067
It must've got beat up by
some of the other planets here

661
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,967
and there.

662
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:26,400
Now I'm in a mad rush to finish.

663
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,967
I have to finish, or else,
I will be going home.

664
00:26:29,967 --> 00:26:34,233
To assemble my cake,
I take my peach crème pâtissière

665
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:36,100
and then put that
in the middle and then

666
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,467
my second layer of cake,
and then on the outside,

667
00:26:38,467 --> 00:26:40,400
I put my American
buttercream frosting.

668
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,833
I alternate between my blue,
my pink and my white

669
00:26:44,833 --> 00:26:48,167
to make almost, like,
a galaxy-looking cake.

670
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:50,167
-Time?
-Three minutes, Alex.

671
00:26:50,167 --> 00:26:53,067
Aye, yi, yi.

672
00:26:53,067 --> 00:26:54,533
There's almost no time left,

673
00:26:54,533 --> 00:26:56,433
and Julia is just starting
to fill her cream puffs.

674
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:59,867
-I can't watch.
-You better pipe fast.

675
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:01,633
I'm so far behind.

676
00:27:01,633 --> 00:27:04,533
I spent so much time
remaking my pastry cream.

677
00:27:04,533 --> 00:27:07,300
My time management is not good.

678
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,167
Julia, you're cutting it close.

679
00:27:09,167 --> 00:27:10,567
I know.

680
00:27:10,567 --> 00:27:12,433
I'm doing the math
inside my head,

681
00:27:12,433 --> 00:27:16,133
and making 12 cream puffs
in only a few minutes,

682
00:27:16,133 --> 00:27:18,267
I don't think I'll have time.

683
00:27:18,267 --> 00:27:19,733
Julia, are you gonna finish?

684
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:22,067
I don't think so.

685
00:27:22,067 --> 00:27:23,167
-You can do it.
-You can do it.

686
00:27:23,167 --> 00:27:24,433
-Go, go, go.
-Am I even --

687
00:27:24,433 --> 00:27:25,800
Everybody's gonna finish,
right?

688
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,100
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

689
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,567
-You got it.
-It's okay, Julia.

690
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:29,933
You got this.

691
00:27:29,933 --> 00:27:32,900
Take your time.
Take your time. Breathe.
Breathe.

692
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,367
Touchdown.

693
00:27:34,367 --> 00:27:36,967
I'm rushing to get
this Sun on top.

694
00:27:36,967 --> 00:27:39,600
Oh, my god. Disaster.

695
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
Keep your head in the game.

696
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,267
I want to make sure that
I cover the cardboard

697
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:44,233
because the judges
will really hit me

698
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:47,067
if I serve them cardboard again.

699
00:27:47,067 --> 00:27:48,700
Looks like a little planet
is there.

700
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,400
I just put all these dollops
all over my cake,

701
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,533
and they look like
little planets

702
00:27:52,533 --> 00:27:53,867
'cause there's eight of them.

703
00:27:53,867 --> 00:27:57,567
They're all orbiting the sun.

704
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,800
One minute,
you've got this, Julia.

705
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,500
I can do this.

706
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,133
I'm taking an airbrush
and brushing on some black.

707
00:28:06,133 --> 00:28:08,133
It does resemble a galaxy.

708
00:28:08,133 --> 00:28:09,833
7...6...

709
00:28:09,833 --> 00:28:13,600
5...4...

710
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,167
3...2...1...

711
00:28:17,167 --> 00:28:21,500
Hands up.

712
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,267
Oh, no.

713
00:28:23,267 --> 00:28:28,467
My cereal treat
is imploding right now.

714
00:28:28,467 --> 00:28:31,667
Now I'm going to have to present
this sun to the judges,

715
00:28:31,667 --> 00:28:34,067
and it doesn't even
look like a sun.

716
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:38,300
Oh...

717
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,767
Intergalactic desserts,
fantastic.

718
00:28:41,767 --> 00:28:43,433
Can't wait.

719
00:28:43,433 --> 00:28:45,133
Hey, Abby.

720
00:28:45,133 --> 00:28:46,300
-Hi.
-Hi, honey.

721
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,067
How's it going, Abby?

722
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:52,133
So what happened to the sun?

723
00:28:52,133 --> 00:28:56,567
It had a lot of gas in it
and then it exploded.

724
00:28:56,567 --> 00:28:59,167
-So it's the end of the world?
-Yes.

725
00:28:59,167 --> 00:29:00,767
I love that you took the time

726
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,167
to make different color
for the rays.

727
00:29:03,167 --> 00:29:04,200
I wish it had stayed
together, though.

728
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,267
-Yeah.
-Darn it.

729
00:29:05,267 --> 00:29:07,400
Tell us about your cake pops.

730
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:13,067
My cake pops are a mango cake
pop dipped in coating chocolate.

731
00:29:13,067 --> 00:29:14,300
I hope it tastes
as good as it looks

732
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,833
because I love looking at it.

733
00:29:15,833 --> 00:29:19,833
It's just sparkly and swirly
and colorful and fun.

734
00:29:19,833 --> 00:29:24,067
I actually really like the fact
that there's like black, black,

735
00:29:24,067 --> 00:29:25,567
black, black,
little bit of color,

736
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,900
black, black, black,
black, little bit of color.

737
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,900
Here we go.

738
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:39,967
**

739
00:29:39,967 --> 00:29:42,200
Your cake here
is really mashed up.

740
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,800
Now it tastes good and it
really tastes like mango,

741
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,400
and that's awesome,
but I think it's a little dense,

742
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,133
and I feel like the texture,

743
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:51,933
you still want it
to be reminiscent of cake.

744
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:55,800
It's almost like cookie dough,
a touch on the sweet side

745
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,167
because the chocolate is sweet,
and I love it.

746
00:29:59,167 --> 00:30:00,267
-You do?
-I love it.

747
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,567
Okay. [ Laughs ]

748
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:05,200
Let's taste this sun,
shall we?

749
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:09,067
Cereal treat, very tasty,
fell apart, though.

750
00:30:09,067 --> 00:30:10,867
-Oops.
-Abby, thank you so much.

751
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:11,867
-Thanks, Abby.
-Thank you.

752
00:30:11,867 --> 00:30:13,267
See you.

753
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:17,033
Oh, I'm really worried.

754
00:30:20,467 --> 00:30:23,700
**

755
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,633
Intergalactic desserts.

756
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,033
I love this challenge,
love it.

757
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:30,333
Alex.

758
00:30:30,333 --> 00:30:31,933
All right. So tell us your
freeze-dried ingredient

759
00:30:31,933 --> 00:30:35,100
and your intergalactic
inspiration.

760
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,067
I got the freeze-dried peaches,

761
00:30:38,067 --> 00:30:40,300
and my inspiration
behind this cake

762
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,333
is my love for science
and planets and stars,

763
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,533
so I made a vanilla tye-dye cake

764
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:49,900
with dried peach
crème pâtissière filling

765
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,400
and American buttercream,

766
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,233
which I dyed a few
different colors.

767
00:30:53,233 --> 00:30:56,200
And then the sun
is actually a cake ball,

768
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,867
and on the outside,
you have yellow candy melts

769
00:30:58,867 --> 00:31:01,167
and I rolled it in sprinkles.

770
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:02,400
-Alex.
-Yeah?

771
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,100
I am so proud of you.

772
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,333
Oh, thank you.

773
00:31:05,333 --> 00:31:07,100
Are you looking
for redemption?

774
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,233
-Yeah.
-Yeah, aw.

775
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:11,067
I love the swirls.

776
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:14,733
It's almost like the sun
is exploding.

777
00:31:14,733 --> 00:31:18,300
I love that you hid
the cardboard.

778
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,100
There are a couple
little technical flaws.

779
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:24,400
Your icing job, you just need
to be a little bit smoother,

780
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,300
and the sun is not
quite centered on the cake.

781
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,400
I wish the sun was
a little more round,

782
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,067
a little more well-defined.

783
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:32,200
I don't mind the finish
on the cake.

784
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,800
I really do think it looks
like a rustically-iced cake.

785
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:39,333
**

786
00:31:39,333 --> 00:31:43,967
Hmm, now I was supposed
to taste peach in there?

787
00:31:43,967 --> 00:31:45,533
Yeah.

788
00:31:45,533 --> 00:31:48,667
Oh, my goodness.
Is he not tasting the peach?

789
00:31:48,667 --> 00:31:50,633
Well, that's good 'cause
I totally taste peaches.

790
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:51,733
Oh, okay, good.

791
00:31:51,733 --> 00:31:53,333
Don't you dare mess
with me like that.

792
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,500
You can really make me pass out.

793
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,300
I love all the colors in here,
and the crème pâtissière

794
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:02,067
is so lovely
and creamy and smooth.

795
00:32:02,067 --> 00:32:06,767
That is a really light, fluffy,
tender, delicious, moist cake.

796
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,067
Thank you.

797
00:32:08,067 --> 00:32:11,733
We need to try the sun
a little bit.

798
00:32:11,733 --> 00:32:14,267
I love the crunch
of the non-pareils

799
00:32:14,267 --> 00:32:17,500
and the coating chocolate,
and then that flavor.

800
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,567
You get that cake flavor
right inside.

801
00:32:19,567 --> 00:32:21,833
-I'm impressed.
-I'm very impressed, Alex.

802
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,067
Oh, okay, that's good.

803
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,333
You redeemed yourself today.

804
00:32:24,333 --> 00:32:26,067
-Okay, thank you.
-See you.

805
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:29,700
I think my galaxy cake is gonna
blast me to the semi-finals.

806
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,933
**

807
00:32:31,933 --> 00:32:33,400
Bryn.

808
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,533
My freeze-dried ingredient
was freeze-dried bananas,

809
00:32:36,533 --> 00:32:40,533
and I made a banana cupcake
with banana frosting.

810
00:32:40,533 --> 00:32:42,167
That sun is so cool.

811
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,500
Thank you.

812
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,700
I love it, but what is
the red bug on my...

813
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,100
It's supposed to be
rocket ships.

814
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,967
Oh, it's a rocket ship.

815
00:32:52,967 --> 00:32:55,867
Some have, like,
a planet on them.

816
00:32:55,867 --> 00:32:57,133
-Oh, I got a planet --
-Yeah.

817
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:58,433
...and a rocket.

818
00:32:58,433 --> 00:33:02,467
What I'm looking at here
is naked cupcake,

819
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:04,800
and it would have been nice
to fill all this nakedness

820
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,367
in with the blue.

821
00:33:06,367 --> 00:33:07,967
I, too, would like to see
this a little fuller,

822
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,333
but I can't get too mad

823
00:33:09,333 --> 00:33:11,233
because this is the color
of the Baltimore Ravens,

824
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:13,400
the greatest football team.

825
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,467
I don't think the purple is
enough to let me really say,

826
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:18,533
"Okay, yeah,
this is outer space."

827
00:33:18,533 --> 00:33:20,600
This rocket ship
is kind of adorable.

828
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,433
**

829
00:33:24,433 --> 00:33:28,233
Bryn, this is so moist --

830
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:30,533
-Oh, thank you.
-...and so yummy.

831
00:33:30,533 --> 00:33:32,733
It's saying,
"Banana, banana, banana."

832
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:35,367
I don't know if it says
intergalactic to me,

833
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:37,200
but that is
one yummy cupcake.

834
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,367
-Thank you.
-A little dense.

835
00:33:39,367 --> 00:33:40,433
Okay.

836
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:43,733
A little dense,
you need to be fluffier.

837
00:33:43,733 --> 00:33:45,067
You got good banana flavor,

838
00:33:45,067 --> 00:33:46,500
and that's really,
that's tough to do.

839
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:49,067
Let me try and taste this Sun.

840
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:52,133
You have anything to say, Sun?

841
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:55,700
Seriously, Bryn,
that technique with the rays

842
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,733
is just so wonderful.

843
00:33:57,733 --> 00:34:02,067
Thank you.

844
00:34:02,067 --> 00:34:04,767
You're like a child, just --

845
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:06,133
I am pretty strong.

846
00:34:06,133 --> 00:34:08,267
Oh, no.

847
00:34:08,267 --> 00:34:12,167
That looks so good.

848
00:34:12,167 --> 00:34:14,933
Mm-hmm, that's yummy.

849
00:34:14,933 --> 00:34:16,433
That sun was hilarious.

850
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:19,067
It was a fun, interactive
moment with your dessert there.

851
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,567
-[ Laughs ]
-Thank you, Bryn.

852
00:34:20,567 --> 00:34:23,067
-Thanks, Bryn.
-You're welcome. Thank you.

853
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:25,400
**

854
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,433
-Hi, Linsey.
-Hi.

855
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,967
What kind of cookies are they?

856
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,633
Strawberry sugar cookies.

857
00:34:31,633 --> 00:34:35,333
I made royal icing, and I piped
them in swirls and I did,

858
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,867
like, a drag marble.

859
00:34:36,867 --> 00:34:38,167
It's beautiful.

860
00:34:38,167 --> 00:34:39,667
Thank you.

861
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,967
Mine looks like
a far out galaxy.

862
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:45,100
It's pretty far out, man.

863
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,800
It's like you're flying
into a black hole.

864
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,167
For the sun, I made
a rice cereal treat.

865
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:53,100
I painted on some yellow
gold luster dust.

866
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,767
The sun is really beautiful.

867
00:34:54,767 --> 00:34:58,200
If I was at, like,
the restaurant at NASA,

868
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,767
you know, and this
is what I got for dessert,

869
00:34:59,767 --> 00:35:02,233
I'd be pretty happy about that.
You know?

870
00:35:02,233 --> 00:35:03,700
Let's see what's going on here.

871
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:06,267
Ooh, looks like it's going to be
a little bit crunchy

872
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:09,700
and a little bit chewy,
and I think...

873
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,900
That's so good.

874
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,067
Is it good?

875
00:35:12,067 --> 00:35:13,533
-Really?
-Thank you.

876
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:16,967
So strawberry, like, there's
strawberry all through that.

877
00:35:16,967 --> 00:35:20,700
And my brain and my heart

878
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,833
explode with joy.

879
00:35:23,833 --> 00:35:25,633
-Linsey, that's a good cookie.
-Thank you.

880
00:35:25,633 --> 00:35:27,567
You know, I mean, look,
it's perfect on the outside,

881
00:35:27,567 --> 00:35:28,700
nice and crispy.

882
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,300
On the inside,
it's a little bit chewy.

883
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,133
You've just blown me away.

884
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:33,700
There we go.

885
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,200
Thank you.

886
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,067
It's like one of those
chocolate mint candies,

887
00:35:39,067 --> 00:35:41,167
but with the crunchiness
of the cereal treat.

888
00:35:41,167 --> 00:35:43,733
Wow, is this good.
I love it.

889
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:45,233
I could use a little
more marshmallow.

890
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,067
What do you think of the mint?

891
00:35:47,067 --> 00:35:48,533
I don't like it.

892
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,600
I love it.

893
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,800
That's a big bite
of coating chocolate.

894
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,767
Val, you're eating it
like an after-dinner mint.

895
00:35:53,767 --> 00:35:55,067
Thank you, Linsey.

896
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,167
-Linsey, thank you.
-Thank you.

897
00:35:56,167 --> 00:36:00,133
**

898
00:36:00,133 --> 00:36:01,733
Hey, Julia.

899
00:36:01,733 --> 00:36:06,167
I made a cream puff filled
with a apricot pastry cream,

900
00:36:06,167 --> 00:36:07,967
and it's topped with
a white chocolate ganache.

901
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:11,967
It looks really cool, and I love
that you used a couple colors

902
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,933
on there, the orange
and the yellow.

903
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:15,267
It gives it dimension.

904
00:36:15,267 --> 00:36:16,833
-I love sprinkles.
-Yeah.

905
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:20,467
Would I really know
that this was intergalactic?

906
00:36:20,467 --> 00:36:24,633
Well, there is the sun,
so you could, like, guess.

907
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:25,967
It just looks like...

908
00:36:25,967 --> 00:36:27,133
Moon rocks.

909
00:36:27,133 --> 00:36:28,800
-Yeah, but, you know --
-That's spacey.

910
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,100
...yeah, I mean, cream puffs
are delicious, so it's still --

911
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,667
I'm still going to eat it.

912
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:33,900
It's frustrating because I
could see where you were headed,

913
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,067
and it just didn't happen.

914
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:37,700
Yeah.

915
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,700
**

916
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:43,300
So, Julia, your pastry
cream is delicious --

917
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,067
-Yay.
-...super smooth, super velvety.

918
00:36:45,067 --> 00:36:46,167
Okay.

919
00:36:46,167 --> 00:36:47,333
Your pâte à choux
is also really good.

920
00:36:47,333 --> 00:36:49,200
It's nice and dry and crispy.

921
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,167
The bad part is I love
your pastry cream so much,

922
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:55,133
-I didn't get enough of it.
-Okay.

923
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:56,133
I'm tasting a little bit of
the apricot,

924
00:36:56,133 --> 00:37:00,067
barely, barely, barely.

925
00:37:00,067 --> 00:37:01,133
One thing I like
about your sun,

926
00:37:01,133 --> 00:37:03,467
nice and big
and round and bulbous,

927
00:37:03,467 --> 00:37:06,367
just like the sun, and I like
the orange sprinkles on there.

928
00:37:06,367 --> 00:37:07,633
It kind of gives it some depth.

929
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,633
That is so yummy.

930
00:37:09,633 --> 00:37:12,200
Just the right amount
of marshmallow.

931
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:15,500
-You need a lot of marshmallow.
-Mmm!

932
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,733
Well, it didn't really
take me to outer space,

933
00:37:18,733 --> 00:37:20,967
but it definitely
took me to flavor town.

934
00:37:20,967 --> 00:37:22,533
-Thank you, Julia.
-Thank you.

935
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:23,933
Thanks, Julia.

Your baking time
starts...

65
00:02:42,767 --> 00:02:43,833
now!

**

67
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,567
When I go to the beach, I
usually go to the Jersey Shore.

68
00:02:54,567 --> 00:02:58,733
**

69
00:02:58,733 --> 00:03:00,933
I sometimes build sandcastles.

70
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:04,200
Usually I don't because I don't
have, like, the buckets.

71
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,400
I usually, like, dig a giant
hole and then sit in it.

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,767
It sounds, like, really boring,

73
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:12,367
but it's actually
really satisfying.

74
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:17,967
For my baked treat, I am going
to make a mini berry hand pie.

75
00:03:17,967 --> 00:03:20,700
Cold butter.

76
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,667
First I get started
on my pie crust.

77
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:26,733
I put flour, butter and salt
into the food processor,

78
00:03:26,733 --> 00:03:29,367
grind it up until
it resembles crumbs,

79
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,900
and I add in my water and I
also add some white vinegar

80
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:34,700
because that makes it
more flaky, pulse it

81
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,533
until it forms into a dough.

82
00:03:36,533 --> 00:03:38,733
All right.

83
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:40,533
Now I start making my filling.

84
00:03:40,533 --> 00:03:44,233
I take some blueberries,
blackberries and raspberries,

85
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,633
put them into a saucepan,
add some lemon juice,

86
00:03:46,633 --> 00:03:47,900
lemon zest,
a little bit of water

87
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,533
and a little bit of sugar.

88
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:52,600
I think berries and, like,
fruit and stuff,

89
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,300
they're, like, really great
snacks to have at the beach.

90
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,067
I'm making a hand pie
because I think those are easy

91
00:03:58,067 --> 00:04:00,467
to put inside of a sandcastle,

92
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:04,900
and it's also more interesting
than, like, cupcakes or cookies.

93
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,100
I'm gonna make
orange sugar cookies,

94
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,733
and then I'm gonna
cut them out like stars

95
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,567
and make them look
like starfish.

96
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:15,867
I feel like starfish goes
perfectly with a beach theme.

97
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:19,067
I know that my sugar cookie
recipe is really good,

98
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:20,300
and when you think of beach,

99
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,800
you think of, like,
seashells and starfish,

100
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,100
so it's perfect.

101
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,267
For my sugar cookie dough, I'm
gonna cream together butter,

102
00:04:28,267 --> 00:04:31,067
powdered sugar, eggs,
vanilla extract.

103
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:34,400
For my dry ingredients,
I'm gonna add my flour,

104
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:39,833
then I'm gonna add in my
orange juice and orange zest.

105
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,367
I don't know what I'm going
to do

106
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,133
for my rice cereal-treat
sandcastle yet,

107
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:45,067
but I'm gonna
figure it out as I go.

108
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:47,867
I'm gonna make rice
cereal treats after

109
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:52,067
because rice cereal treats
are really easy to make.

your mobile office?

118
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:12,067
The beach reminds me of fruit

119
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:15,100
because you get a lot
of fruity drinks on the beach.

120
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:18,933
So I'm making my sandcastle
out of fruit cereal treats

121
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:21,700
and my baked item
will be peach cobbler cupcakes.

122
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,067
Let's grease these guys.

123
00:05:24,067 --> 00:05:27,067
I'm spraying the bottom
of my cupcake pans

124
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:30,600
just so the peach
cobblers don't stick.

125

Butter.

126
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:34,567
To make my peach cobbler,
first I get started on melting

127
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:37,100
my brown sugar
and butter in a pan.

ALEX: For my baked good, I'm
going to do, like, a mini tart.

130
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,133
Crust is gonna be,
like, sablé dough,

131
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:46,533
and then I'm gonna fill it

132
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:49,067
with a chocolate ganache
and then some raspberries.

133
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:51,067
I want to make tarts
because I love making tarts.

134
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,733
It's so cute,
elegant and beautiful.

135
00:05:53,733 --> 00:05:56,567
Of course they're delicious.

136
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:59,167
To make my sablé dough,
I add butter

137
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,533
and then I whip that up.

138
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:04,067
I add egg yolks and vanilla,
and then on the side,

139
00:06:04,067 --> 00:06:07,300
I have granulated sugar
and confectioners' sugar,

140
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,867
and I mix them together.

141
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:09,967
There we go.

142
00:06:09,967 --> 00:06:11,933
To my flour, I add
a little bit of salt

143
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:15,533
because usually a sablé dough
is kind of like sweet and salty.

144
00:06:17,933 --> 00:06:19,133
I like sablé

145
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,133
because it's almost
like a pastry crust.

146
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,333
Oh, it's like heaven.

147
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:25,867

my last one,

Just let us bake in peace.

Please no twists,
please, but no.

Beaches are
often tropical.

And one of our favorite
tropical flavors

160
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:00,733
is pineapple.

161
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:05,300
So you must use pineapple
in your baked treats.

162
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,467
Pineapple doesn't go with any
of the flavors that I'm using.

Hot, hot, hot.

164

my chocolate raspberry tart

with the pineapple.

sounds disgusting,

upside-down cake?"

I'm combining flour, sugar,
shortening, salt, milk and eggs.

type of pineapple I want,

189
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:28,867
I usually use the rings for
my pineapple upside-down cake,

but the rings don't fit
in these cupcake pans,

191

so I'm just gonna put some
chunks in the bottom of each one

right in the middle.

00:10:26,267 --> 00:10:27,933
To make my rice cereal treats,

238
00:10:27,933 --> 00:10:31,367
I put marshmallows and melt
those down with some butter.

239
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm putting in
my pineapple juice

240
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,933
with my marshmallow mixture,

241
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:39,067
hoping that I'll get
the pineapple flavor

242
00:10:39,067 --> 00:10:42,433
and Duff and Valerie
will be able to taste it.

243
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,333
I'm using the regular
rice cereal

244
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:46,833
because it's the tan
color like sand.

245
00:10:46,833 --> 00:10:49,200
Do I have enough?
Probably.

246
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,533
I need to work really fast,

247
00:10:50,533 --> 00:10:52,067
so I don't put my pie
crust in the fridge.

248
00:10:52,067 --> 00:10:55,467
I just roll it out, so I'm
noticing they're a little small,

249
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:59,300
so I roll them out a bit
more to make them bigger

250
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,800
because there's nothing
worse than a hand pie

251
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,400
that's, like, this much filling
and, like, this much dough.

252
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,867
Close up my hand pie
and use a fork to seal it,

253
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:14,833
and then you also use the fork
to poke holes in the top

254
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:19,333
so the air inside
doesn't make the thing explode.

255
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,833
You do not want
an exploded hand pie.

256
00:11:23,833 --> 00:11:25,967
BRYN: Abby, how you doing?

257
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:29,067
-Good, how are you?
-Good.

258
00:11:29,067 --> 00:11:32,433
I am gonna use fruit cereal
to make my cereal treats

259
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,400
because it's like the rainbow,

260
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,867
and that just reminds
me of the beach.

261
00:11:36,867 --> 00:11:39,500
Hello.
-Hello!

262
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,767
How badly do you want to win
"Kids Baking Championship"?

263
00:11:41,767 --> 00:11:45,067
I want to win "Kids Baking
Championship" so badly.

264
00:11:45,067 --> 00:11:46,167
Why?

265
00:11:46,167 --> 00:11:49,467
Because I want money.

266
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,900
If I win, I'm gonna take
my family on a cruise

267
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,933
and go on a headband
shopping spree

268
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,767
because I wear them
all the time,

269
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:57,767
and they're my
favorite accessory.

270
00:11:57,767 --> 00:12:00,867
I also want to represent
Wisconsin.

271
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,967
Wisconsin.
What?

272
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,867
I said it just like you.

273
00:12:05,867 --> 00:12:08,267
No. You said...
No.

274
00:12:08,267 --> 00:12:10,700
She's totally
over-exaggerating it.

275
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,567
It's just Wisconsin.

276
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:14,667
Teach me how to say it.

277
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,600
-Wisconsin.
-Wisconsin.

278
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,300
Wisconsin.

279
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,833
-Wisconsin.
-Wisconsin.

280
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,333
Yeah.
That was better.

281
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:24,833
-Oh, thank you.
-Yeah.

282
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,867
-Okay. You get going.
-I'm going.

283
00:12:26,867 --> 00:12:28,733
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

284
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:32,267
ABBY: The secret to making
the perfect cereal treat

285
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:35,600
is having lots of butter
and marshmallows.

286
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,967
I'm going to have to watch
the butter, though,

287
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,300
for this challenge

288
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:44,233
because I need my cereal treats
to be strong and sturdy,

289
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:47,167
and if I make them
with too much butter,

290
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:49,767
then they won't be
able to stand up.

291
00:12:49,767 --> 00:12:52,167
Does anybody have
the rice cereal?

292
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:54,200
I do.

293
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,733
I get started on my s'mores
rice cereal treat.

294
00:12:57,733 --> 00:12:59,300
For my cereal mixture,

295
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:02,433
I have 7 1/2 cups
of regular rice cereal

296
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:04,833
and then 7 1/2 cups
of chocolate rice cereal,

297
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,600
and then 1 cup of
chopped graham crackers

298
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,500
and then 1 cup of semi-sweet
baking chocolate chips.

299
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,633
There we go.

300
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,267
I hope that I can make it
to the finale

301
00:13:14,267 --> 00:13:16,300
because I'm
the last boy standing,

302
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,700
and I am so close
to getting that dog I want.

303
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,933
That little puppy just keeps
coming closer and closer.

304
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:24,233
Whoa!

305
00:13:24,233 --> 00:13:28,467
Right now I'm cutting out
my starfish cookies,

306
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,267
and then I'm gonna put them
in the oven so they bake.

307
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:35,467
I'm gonna make my sugar
cookies look like starfish.

308
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,900
Perfect.

309
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,867
Starfish are so cool because you
can break off one of its arms

310
00:13:39,867 --> 00:13:40,867
and it'll grow back.

311
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,333
Going to the oven.

312
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,300
But I wish, like,
starfish cookies,

313
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,667
if you, like, bit into it,

314
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,433
it'd just grow back
and you could keep eating it.

315
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:51,367
Those look good, Abby.
-Thank goodness.

316
00:13:51,367 --> 00:13:53,233
ABBY: I'm checking on my
upside-down cakes,

317
00:13:53,233 --> 00:13:55,900
and they look like
they're ready,

318
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:59,267
but them I'm trying to
get them out of the pan

319
00:13:59,267 --> 00:14:02,733
and they are not
coming out at all.

320
00:14:02,733 --> 00:14:06,867
Oh, look what's going on
at Abby's station.

321
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:10,300
My cakes are kind of
sticking to the pan,

322
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,400
so I have to, like,
pry them out.

323
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,100
This is bad.

324
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,867
It's not how I wanted this
to go.

325
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:22,167
**

326
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,833
One hour left, bakers!

327
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,200
DUFF: Cereal-treat sandcastles
and baked treats.

328
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,233
Mmm.

329
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:33,800
Who wants to stay?
Who wants to go home?

330
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,267
ABBY: This is a major
setback for me

331
00:14:37,267 --> 00:14:40,333
because these pineapple
upside-down cupcakes,

332
00:14:40,333 --> 00:14:44,300
they're supposed to be
my key to the finale,

333
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,967
but they are not
my best baked good.

334
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:50,267
**

335
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:52,767
LINSEY:
Just need to pour it in.

336
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,067
Let's start with that.

337
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:56,400
-Chef Linsey.
-Hello.

338
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,200
DUFF: Ooh, what is that?

339
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,067
I'm making a rice cereal treat
with chocolate cereal.

340
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:03,467
-Awesome.
-That smells so good.

341
00:15:03,467 --> 00:15:06,333
I'm gonna use chocolate
rice cereal for my sandcastle

342
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,800
because I love chocolate.

343
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,267
Who has the cinnamon?

344
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:12,500
Me.

345
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,967
Thank you.

346
00:15:13,967 --> 00:15:17,333
I'm making a cinnamon-chocolate
rice cereal treat sandcastle

347
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,467
because, you know,
you don't want to make, like,

348
00:15:19,467 --> 00:15:21,433
a regular rice
cereal-treat sandcastle.

349
00:15:21,433 --> 00:15:24,367
That's boring because
I love chocolate.

350
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:25,800
We've established that.

351
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,333
And also, cinnamon is a nice
flavor to put with chocolate,

352
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:32,067
and I think it'll kind of
spruce things up a bit.

353
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:34,067
Man, this thing would be
great for snowball fights.

354
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:36,767
ALEX: Perfecto.

355
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:40,367
Now, I'm from Canada, so I have
never made a sandcastle,

356
00:15:40,367 --> 00:15:42,600
but I've made a snowman
and snow forts.

357
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,433
Oh, this smells so good.

358
00:15:44,433 --> 00:15:46,200
I think my rice cereal treats

359
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,433
are gonna stand out
from the others

360
00:15:47,433 --> 00:15:49,333
because I'm doing s'mores.

361
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:50,867
I'm just gonna spray
a sheet pan,

362
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,400
put some on there
for my walls,

363
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,067
and then I'm gonna have
some more for my molds.

364
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,233
DUFF:
Look what Alex is doing.

365
00:15:57,233 --> 00:15:58,767
That's gonna be
his mold, I think.

366
00:15:58,767 --> 00:16:02,100
Oh, smart.

367
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,667
Okay.
There we go.

368
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,867
This Bundt pan and these molds
is just like what you would use

369
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:09,400
to make a sandcastle
at the beach,

370
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:14,100
I think, because I don't really
make sandcastles at all, so...

371
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,500
It takes a lot
of rice cereal treats

372
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,100
to fill this Bundt pan.

373
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,767
It's huge, but you know what?

374
00:16:19,767 --> 00:16:21,767
It's gonna look really good.

375
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:25,067
ABBY: Bryn, your sugar cookies
look pretty done.

376
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,200
Thank you, Abby.

377
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,367
Next I get started
on my royal icing.

378
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:32,167
Royal icing is
simply egg whites,

379
00:16:32,167 --> 00:16:35,267
powdered sugar
and cornstarch.

380
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,433
Perfect.

381
00:16:36,433 --> 00:16:39,133
I'm using the pineapple
in my royal icing,

382
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:41,233
and I'm coloring it yellow

383
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,833
because I like
the color yellow...

384
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,200
Yellow.

385
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,533
...and most starfish are, like,
a yellow-orange color.

386
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:50,367
I want to be in
the finale so bad.

387
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:51,800
There's only four of us left,

388
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,067
and my decorating is going
to help me stand out

389
00:16:55,067 --> 00:17:00,433
because it's beautiful
and clean and wonderful.

390
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:03,300
Bryn, do you ever
make sandcastles on the beach?

391
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,767
Every time we go to the beach,
I always make a sandcastle.

392
00:17:05,767 --> 00:17:06,867
Me, too.

393
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,333
They're, like,
my favorite thing.

394
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:11,700
ABBY: I had never made a
cereal-treat sandcastle before,

395
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:17,100
but I love the beach
because Katie and I

396
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
are very competitive sisters,

397
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:24,500
so when we go to the beach,
we have sandcastle competitions,

398
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:28,533
and our parents are the judges,
but they always say it's a tie

399
00:17:28,533 --> 00:17:29,800
because they don't
want to, like,

400
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,100
have favorites or anything.

401
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,367
VALERIE: No pressure.

402
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,767
You're just baking to
make it to the finale.

403
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:36,667
That's it.
That's all, no pressure.

404
00:17:36,667 --> 00:17:39,333
DUFF: Yeah. We're not gonna be
critical or anything.

405
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,833
You know what?
Let's not even judge it.

406
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:42,833
Nah.

407
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,600
I really wish that
my mom and dad

408
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,267
were the judge
of this competition

409
00:17:46,267 --> 00:17:48,733
and not Duff and Valerie.

410
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:50,800
How are you building
your sandcastle?

411
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,333
I think I'm making mine like
a classic sandcastle because...

412
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,333
-Okay.
-...I love making sandcastles,

413
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,933
and that's usually
the vision I have.

414
00:17:57,933 --> 00:17:59,333
All right.

415
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:01,967
So, Linsey, how badly do you
want to be in the finale?

416
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,833
I really want to be
in the finale

417
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:05,333
because, I mean,
you've worked really hard.

418
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:06,433
You've beat out, like,
thousands of kids

419
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,567
even just to get here,

420
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,400
and then just being
in the finale is,

421
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,300
like, it's unbelievable.

422
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,733
-You really want it?
-Yeah.

423
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:14,867
Okay. All right.
Well, then, better deliver.

424
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:16,200
-Okay.
-Good luck.

425
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,633
Thank you.

426
00:18:17,633 --> 00:18:20,400
LINSEY:
I want some for decoration.

427
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,267
If I win, I would save a bunch,
give some to, like, my parents

428
00:18:24,267 --> 00:18:27,067
and then the rest I would spend

429
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:29,200
probably on a bunch
of baking stuff.

430
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,867
45 minutes left, bakers.

431
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:34,800
**

432
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:38,800
Cereal-treat sandcastles
in 45 minutes!

433
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,600
You better start
dumping that, girl.

434
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:43,467
I'm going!

435
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,933
Sounds like my children.

436
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:48,800
This is a lot of cereal treats.

437
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,933
"I'm going, Mom."

438
00:18:52,667 --> 00:18:54,700
ABBY: Valerie would be
a really cool mom

439
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,300
because she would
cook delicious dinners

440
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,067
and she's a celebrity,

441
00:19:00,067 --> 00:19:02,200
so I would be
a celebrity's child.

442
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,567
I just have to flatten them.

443
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,333
Flat.

444
00:19:08,333 --> 00:19:11,600
But my mom's cooler.

445
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,333
-Bryn, you okay?
-Yeah.

446
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,900
I always build sandcastles
at the beach.

447
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,167
They're so much fun,

448
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,467
and you can do so many
different things with it.

449
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:26,500
Two years ago, my dad
and I and my sister,

450
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:29,067
we made this huge sandcastle,

451
00:19:29,067 --> 00:19:31,567
and it was, like,
3 stories tall,

452
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:34,300
but Sun's more into tanning now.

453
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,467
She wants to be tan.

454
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:40,233
Now I just build
sandcastles with my dad.

455
00:19:40,233 --> 00:19:42,067
30 minutes, bakers.

456
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,700
Do I have enough time
to make walls?

457
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:51,433
I got my molds filled
and cooling,

458
00:19:51,433 --> 00:19:53,067
and I'm thinking,
"Oh, my goodness.

459
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:54,800
Am I gonna have enough
rice cereal treats

460
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:57,300
to make the walls
and enough for the judges?"

461
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,667
Linsey, do you have
extra marshmallows?

462
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,767
-Yes.
-I think, "You know what?

463
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:03,633
I've just got to
start another batch."

464
00:20:03,633 --> 00:20:07,000
I'm doing another quick batch
of these rice cereal treats.

465
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,667
This is to get us to the finale.

466
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:12,633
I want to have a nice
big castle, big display.

467
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:14,300
VALERIE: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa.

468
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,600
Alex is making a new batch
of cereal treats.

469
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,000
What is going on?

470
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,133
I need to hustle because
if I don't get this done,

471
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:22,133
well, bye-bye me.

472
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,667
Another batch, stressful.

473
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:32,300
**

474
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,633
DUFF:
30 minutes, bakers!

475
00:20:33,633 --> 00:20:34,967
I need to focus, focus.

476
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:37,800
I think I'm taking a risk
because I'm making

477
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,800
more rice cereal treats.

478
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:42,633
I'm using the same pot, throwing
in some butter and marshmallows.

479
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,800
I add my cereal,
mix it together.

480
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,033
Boom. I'm done.
There we go.

481
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,000
I think I'm like
Speedy Gonzales right here.

482
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,233
Hopefully these tarts
will turn out.

483
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:54,700
So after my rice cereal treats,
my second batch is all done.

484
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,767
I'm gonna start
building my tarts.

485
00:20:56,767 --> 00:21:01,333
I think my little tarts look
so good, look like the tropics.

486
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:04,300
I should see sandcastles
starting to be built.

487
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,600
I should see
walls going up.

488
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,067
I want to see turrets.

489
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,100
VALERIE: Hurry, bakers.

490
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,067
You got to get
these sandcastles made,

491
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:14,067
and they need to be
beautiful and impressive.

492
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,500
ABBY: Time's running out,

493
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,100
and I need to start assembling
my sandcastle,

494
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,267
like, yesterday.

495
00:21:20,267 --> 00:21:21,767
To build my sandcastle,

496
00:21:21,767 --> 00:21:25,267
I'm taking each of
my sheet-pan walls

497
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,833
so that way, it forms a box.

498
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:31,100
Abby, how are you doing?

499
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,067
Good.

500
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,167
Not really, actually.

501
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,133
That's a big sandcastle.

502
00:21:37,133 --> 00:21:39,067
Seriously?

503
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:40,800
[ Sighs ]

504
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm definitely starting
to stress...

505
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,267
Does anyone have
the waffle cones?

506
00:21:46,267 --> 00:21:47,400
I do.

507
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,133
...because I'm down
to the wire on time,

508
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:52,433
and I still have to
assemble my castle.

509
00:21:52,433 --> 00:21:55,533
My sandcastle plan is
to make a regular square,

510
00:21:55,533 --> 00:21:58,900
then take my turrets
and put them on each corner,

511
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,800
and then I'm gonna use
some coating chocolate

512
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,300
to make it as sturdy
as possible.

513
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:09,200
There's a lot of pressure riding
on this rice cereal castle.

514
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,767
I am so close to the title
of Kids Baking Champion.

515
00:22:13,767 --> 00:22:16,867
I can almost reach it.

516
00:22:16,867 --> 00:22:19,567
If I am the next Kids
Baking Champion,

517
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:22,333
my business will blow up.

518
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:26,400
Who doesn't want a birthday cake
from the Kids Baking Champion?

519
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,567
Probably do it like that, right?

520
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:28,567
Okay.

521
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:30,333
I start assembling
my sandcastle,

522
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,833
and I take two of my walls,

523
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,600
spread on some
coating chocolate.

524
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,933
All right.

525
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:36,933
I go with coating chocolate
to hold it all together

526
00:22:36,933 --> 00:22:39,667
because coating
chocolate hardens,

527
00:22:39,667 --> 00:22:41,533
and I think it'll look good.

528
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:44,733
So, you know, my ancestors
lived in a castle.

529
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:46,133
-Really?
-So I kind of...

530
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:49,900
You know, I could live in
a sandcastle because I get it.

531
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,900
I think my ancestors, like,
tilled the ground

532
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:56,267
around your
ancestors' castle.

533
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,700
Hopefully
they can come out.

534
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,067
I'm ready to get my rice cereal
treats out of these molds.

535
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:04,067
**

536
00:23:04,067 --> 00:23:07,333
I'm trying to get them out,
but they're just not coming out.

537
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:10,200
**

538
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,500
Uh-oh.
Oh, my goodness.

539
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,533
Are these gonna come out?

540
00:23:12,533 --> 00:23:14,933
Oh, shoot.
Come on.

541
00:23:14,933 --> 00:23:17,167
So I really bang it,
and then...

542
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:19,400
* Ahh *

543
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,133
Yes.
Two of them came out.

544
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:22,100
Phew!

545
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,633
**

546
00:23:24,633 --> 00:23:25,733
ABBY: Crap.

547
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:28,133
To try and make
the walls more study,

548
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,933
I'm cutting them in half

549
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:33,300
and then using that
as the wall instead.

550
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:36,533
Then I'm sticking toothpicks
in each corner

551
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:39,267
so that way the walls
stay together.

552
00:23:39,267 --> 00:23:42,433
Now I'm thinking to myself,

553
00:23:42,433 --> 00:23:44,367
"Well, this looks
really boring,"

554
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:47,900
so I'm deciding
to cut a door out,

555
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:51,700
but when I cut it,
the wall starts to cave in,

556
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:56,267
and it is a big mess.

557
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:57,367
LINSEY: Nope.

558
00:23:57,367 --> 00:24:01,600
I think I should reinforce
the walls a bit.

559
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,900
At this point, everything
is just not holding,

560
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,200
and the walls
are way too thin.

561
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,367
This has to be a sandcastle,
not a pile of sand.

562
00:24:09,367 --> 00:24:10,600
What the heck?

563
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,067
Then I realize, "Oh, there's
that cold spray,

564
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:16,367
that magic cold spray
in the pantry."

565
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,933
Whoa.

566
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:20,500
So I'm spraying it on, and it's,
like, drying the chocolate.

567
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,267
Whoa!
This is cool.

568
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:24,733
Why haven't I used this
in the past?

569
00:24:24,733 --> 00:24:26,667
Some magic...

570
00:24:26,667 --> 00:24:29,633
And I feel like a superhero
with that gun,

571
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,133
like, my freeze ray.

572
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:36,200
10 minutes, bakers,
10 minutes left.

573
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,367
BRYN: I finally have
my castle assembled,

574
00:24:38,367 --> 00:24:40,600
and I have to put
my cookies in there.

575
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,600
Then I'm like,
"This looks way too boring."

576
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,300
So I run over to the pantry and
grab these charcoal rock things.

577
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:52,633
The charcoal candies are
supposed to be like rocks

578
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:55,167
around my sandcastle,

579
00:24:55,167 --> 00:24:57,700
and then I put the two
gumdrops on the front

580
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,233
so it looks like bushes.

581
00:25:00,233 --> 00:25:02,100
ABBY: Oh, seriously?

582
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:06,667
My wall is caving
in really fast,

583
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:10,700
and my door situation
is not helping

584
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,467
and I need to add
some extra support

585
00:25:13,467 --> 00:25:15,667
so I'm grabbing
some plastic cups

586
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:18,333
just to help hold up my castle.

587
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:23,067
I'm ready
to build this thing.

588
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:28,333
I get my main piece
which is my Bundt.

589
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:35,933
And then I try to figure out
how I'm gonna build this.

590
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:37,400
All right.

591
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,833
I grab my tarts, and then
I place them into my castle as,

592
00:25:39,833 --> 00:25:42,667
like, little soldiers
walking into battle.

593
00:25:43,767 --> 00:25:45,167
My tarts are gonna fight

594
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:47,267
all the other girls'
little treats.

595
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,333
Well, you know what?
Let's not get too mean.

596
00:25:49,333 --> 00:25:52,067
BRYN: Your sandcastle
looks good, Linsey.

597
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:53,233
Thank you.

598
00:25:53,233 --> 00:25:54,500
DUFF: Looks like Linsey is
brushing the outside

599
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,767
of her castle
with coating chocolate.

600
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,667
It's probably smart,
help keep it together.

601
00:25:58,667 --> 00:26:00,600
Are there
graham crackers?

602
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,600
-I have them.
-Like mortar.

603
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,400
And crushed graham crackers
to make it look

604
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,867
like sand, very smart.

605
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:09,567
While I'm building
the sandcastle,

606
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,667
it's looking
a little bit boring.

607
00:26:11,667 --> 00:26:13,300
I realize, "Oh, I should
probably use

608
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,467
some graham cracker crust
because that would be cool.

609
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:19,067
That would help it look
like a sandcastle."

610
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,400
Abby, how you doing?
You okay down there?

611
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,367
ABBY: No.
The cups are not working.

612
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,267
This is terrible!

613
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:33,500
These walls look like
an elephant stomped on them.

614
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:38,733
I'm frantically replacing
the one caving-in wall.

615
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,900
Seriously?

616
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,867
Things are not looking
pretty right now.

617
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,967
90 seconds, bakers.

618
00:26:47,967 --> 00:26:49,800
BRYN:
I'm looking at my sandcastle,

619
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,867
and it's definitely not
the prettiest thing you'll see.

620
00:26:52,867 --> 00:26:55,633
You can definitely see a lot
of my coating chocolate,

621
00:26:55,633 --> 00:26:58,567
but I'd rather see
the coating chocolate

622
00:26:58,567 --> 00:27:01,400
than not have
a castle at all.

623
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:04,067
Bakers, remember, your stuff
has to hold together.

624
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:08,133

[ Gasps ]

626
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,633
I'm freaking out right now,
and I just see it fall apart,

627
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:21,167
and it's just so sad to see your
masterpiece go crumbling down.

628
00:27:21,167 --> 00:27:22,400
This thing can't fall.

629
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,133
That's the whole challenge.

630
00:27:24,133 --> 00:27:26,700
I'm holding it together
until they call time,

631
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:30,300
and I'm just gonna
hope that it stays.

632
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:34,267
ABBY: I'm deciding to take off
the wall with the door on it

633
00:27:34,267 --> 00:27:37,067
because it is caving in.

634
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:41,733
Now I'm adding an arch
so it looks a little better.

635

DUFF AND VALERIE:
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

Yeah.

640

Cereal-treat sandcastles.

641
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,067
Filled with goodies.

642
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,533
Hey, Abby.
Come on in.

643
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,200
ABBY: There's a lot of pressure
on me today

644
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,267
because I really want
to make it to the finale,

645
00:28:16,267 --> 00:28:19,700
but I don't know
if this is good enough.

646
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,833
Hi.

647
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,233
Hi.

648
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:25,100
What's going on?

649
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,633
Um, it's kind of tippy,

650
00:28:27,633 --> 00:28:30,833
but it's a rainbow.

651
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:31,900
Yeah.

652
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,300
I like your choice
of cereal treats.

653
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,367
Thank you.

654
00:28:34,367 --> 00:28:36,567
So tell us what you made
for us today.

655
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:40,367
I made a pineapple
upside-down cupcake

656
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:45,667
with a fruit
cereal-treat sandcastle.

657
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:48,533
What happened
with your arch?

658
00:28:48,533 --> 00:28:51,767
It fell in.

659
00:28:51,767 --> 00:28:53,067
Yeah.
The arch is tough.

660
00:28:53,067 --> 00:28:54,233
Yeah.

661
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:57,300
Your walls are really high,
and that's cool,

662
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:01,667
but I think that might
have contributed to this.

663
00:29:01,667 --> 00:29:02,933
You know?

664
00:29:02,933 --> 00:29:04,900
You know what might
have helped, too,

665
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,067
is in real castles,
when the walls go up,

666
00:29:07,067 --> 00:29:08,933
they all have a base
to them.

667
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,100
Yeah.

668
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,067
But I noticed you did use
some toothpicks

669
00:29:11,067 --> 00:29:12,400
to try
and keep it together.

670
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,400
-Yeah.
-All right.

671
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,133
So your castle,
it's a little funky.

672
00:29:15,133 --> 00:29:17,100
-It's a little wonky.
-Let's taste the wall.

673
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,067
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

674
00:29:22,067 --> 00:29:25,533
I forgot how much
I love fruit cereal.

675
00:29:25,533 --> 00:29:26,833
Fruit cereal is a really
nice choice

676
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,300
because
it's really colorful.

677
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,800
I love the way
this stuff tastes.

678
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,433
I love that you made pineapple
upside-down cakes.

679
00:29:33,433 --> 00:29:35,100
Let's taste it.
-All right.

680
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:37,900
It looks like you had
a little trouble

681
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,300
getting these out
of the pan.

682
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,333
Yes.

683
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:43,600
I hoped
he wouldn't notice that.

684
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,067
Mmm.

685
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:50,200
It's moist,
sweet, pineapple-y.

686
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,667
It's a really delicious
pineapple upside-down cake.

687
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,433
Yeah. Abby,
your cake is really good.

688
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:57,233
Getting a lot of
pineapple flavor.

689
00:29:57,233 --> 00:29:58,367
Man, I just wish

690
00:29:58,367 --> 00:29:59,833
that it came out
of the pan clean, you know,

691
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,467
because that's just
such a great look.

692
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,600
Yeah.

693
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,200
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

694
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,133
Thanks, Abby.

695
00:30:07,133 --> 00:30:09,233
I loved her cake,
absolutely loved her cake,

696
00:30:09,233 --> 00:30:11,567
but her castle didn't quite
turn out how she had hoped.

697
00:30:11,567 --> 00:30:12,967
I think here she was
just too ambitious,

698
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:15,600
but the cake
was delicious.

699
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,100
Yeah.

700
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,333
Alex.

701
00:30:18,333 --> 00:30:19,233
Hello.

702
00:30:19,233 --> 00:30:20,367
Hi, Alex.

703
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,433
Well, tell us
about your castle.

704
00:30:22,433 --> 00:30:24,267
So my castle is actually

705
00:30:24,267 --> 00:30:27,100
a s'mores-rice-cereal-
treat castle,

706
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,767
and then the baked item is
actually a piña colada tart.

707
00:30:30,767 --> 00:30:33,600
These are adorable.

708
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,133
I just want to cut it open
to see how deep.

709
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:38,433
I would have liked to have
seen a little bit

710
00:30:38,433 --> 00:30:39,667
more
of that pastry cream.

711
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:41,367
There's a lot
of crust in there.

712
00:30:41,367 --> 00:30:42,567
Okay.

713
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,833
But the flavor itself,
you really nailed it.

714
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,567
Good coconut flavor,
it's in there,

715
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:48,167
and the pineapple
is in there, too.

716
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:50,067
Okay.
I do love that crust.

717
00:30:50,067 --> 00:30:52,767
It falls apart like a really
great sandy cookie.

718
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:54,767
Okay.

719
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,367
Tell me about, like,

720
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,967
the design
of your castle here.

721
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:01,067
Like,
what goes on in here?

722
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:03,300
The soldiers go in
through that doorway,

723
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:04,433
and then they all meet up

724
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:06,167
in that big little
volcano-looking thing,

725
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,100
that Bundt, and then
they have their meetings,

726
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,333
and then they go to battle here

727
00:31:09,333 --> 00:31:11,067
and there with all
the other castles.

728
00:31:11,067 --> 00:31:12,400
Okay.

729
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,533
You're definitely planning
on some sort of siege.

730
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:16,500
Well, isn't that what
castles are all about?

731
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,133
Yeah.
Protection.

732
00:31:18,133 --> 00:31:21,533
I love that
you used a Bundt pan

733
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:25,567
to make the big
soldier-gathering place.

734
00:31:25,567 --> 00:31:29,300
It just is a really interesting,
fun-looking castle.

735
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Let's taste it.

736
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:37,200
**

737
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,600
Do you know what
a third-party manufacturer is?

738
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,433
I do not speak French.
I don't know.

739
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,367
We need to call
a third-party manufacturer

740
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,800
and have them start making
these and selling them

741
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,233
in stores
because they're amazing.

742
00:31:48,233 --> 00:31:49,300
-Oh, really?
-Amazing.

743
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,233
-It's delicious. Yeah.
-Thank you.

744
00:31:50,233 --> 00:31:51,800
-It's...
-S'mores.

745
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,333
...s'mores
in a cereal treat.

746
00:31:53,333 --> 00:31:55,233
Well done, you.
-Thank you.

747
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,533
Booyah.

748
00:31:56,533 --> 00:31:57,900
Yeah.
-Thanks, Alex.

749
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:59,533
Okay. Thank you.

750
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:00,967
Like, I knew this was
gonna be delicious

751
00:32:00,967 --> 00:32:02,267
because I picked up
this little thing,

752
00:32:02,267 --> 00:32:03,267
and it's, like, 3 pounds.

753
00:32:03,267 --> 00:32:05,633
Yeah.
It's really tasty.

754
00:32:05,633 --> 00:32:08,800
**

755
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:12,533
It looks like there's
a vampire or a werewolf

756
00:32:12,533 --> 00:32:15,067
in there that's
waiting to get me.

757
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:16,200
Let's bring in Linsey.

758
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,933
-Yeah.
-Hey, Linsey.

This is the last round
until the finale,

760
00:32:21,467 --> 00:32:24,300

to get through it.

761
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,467
How's it going, Chef?

762
00:32:25,467 --> 00:32:26,567
Pretty good.

763

Tell us about your day
and your castle.

764
00:32:27,867 --> 00:32:30,733
So for my castle,
I made a cinnamon

765
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:32,967
and chocolate rice cereal treat.

766
00:32:32,967 --> 00:32:35,867
I tried to cover my castle
with graham cracker crumbs

767
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,267
to kind of make it
look more like sand.

768
00:32:37,267 --> 00:32:38,367
Hmm.
Okay.

769
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:40,067
I like the graham crackers
on the outside,

770
00:32:40,067 --> 00:32:42,333
and it's holding
together really well.

771
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,633
All right.
Let's taste your treat.

772
00:32:43,633 --> 00:32:46,067
I can smell the cinnamon.
I'm very excited about this.

773
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:49,700
**

774
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,600
This starts off so good,

775
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:54,633
but as the cinnamon
builds,

776
00:32:54,633 --> 00:32:57,200
maybe you're a little
heavy-handed on the cinnamon.

777
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,433
Okay.

778
00:32:58,433 --> 00:32:59,800
I have a problem with adding
too much cinnamon.

779
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:02,300
You can do less cinnamon,
and it would be really good,

780
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:04,067
and you could also keep it
just the way it is,

781
00:33:04,067 --> 00:33:05,167
and it's still
really good.

782
00:33:05,167 --> 00:33:07,367
You know what I mean?
-Okay.

783
00:33:07,367 --> 00:33:08,600
And what is your treat
that you baked?

784
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,900
It looks like an empanada.

785
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:14,267
My treat is a mixed berry
and pineapple hand pie.

786
00:33:14,267 --> 00:33:16,467
-Oh.
-Hand pie.

787
00:33:16,467 --> 00:33:17,867
See, with all those
berries in there,

788
00:33:17,867 --> 00:33:19,433
I hope we can taste
that pineapple,

789
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:20,733
but this looks really...

790
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:22,267
I mean, you know?

791
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,800
It's beautiful.

792
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,067
If I got that
at a restaurant,

793
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:26,467
I'd be totally fine
with that.
Yeah.

794
00:33:26,467 --> 00:33:30,100
That...That's a really
big accomplishment

795
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,433
because restaurants,

796
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,067
I mean, their sole purpose

797
00:33:33,067 --> 00:33:34,967
is, like, cooking
and baking and stuff.

798
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,733
Let's taste this pie.

799
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:40,433
You know, you got a good ratio
of pie crust to filling.

800
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,367
Right off the bat,
I got my pineapple.

801
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,600
One small, tiny little
problem, though --

802
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,933
I would have liked it
a little bit sweeter.

803
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,100

Okay.

You did.

827
00:34:31,233 --> 00:34:33,700
I wanted to make it look
like a real sandcastle,

828
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,400
so I used just
the regular cereal treat

829
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,600
so it has the tan color.

830
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:40,733
Well, I like
the landscaping.

831
00:34:40,733 --> 00:34:42,067
-Okay.
-I think it's neat.

832
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:43,767
It looks like you put a lot
of chocolate on there.

833
00:34:43,767 --> 00:34:47,100
It was just to try to keep it
from falling and tumbling.

834
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,433
Got you.
That can be a little neater.

835

That's one thing I know.

Decorating is my thing,
and it's in front of them,

837

838
00:34:56,867 --> 00:34:58,800
It's unfortunate
that you've got

839
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,333
three fairly good turrets,

840
00:35:00,333 --> 00:35:03,067
and then the one,
it just keeps tipping over,

841
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,233
and if you had
evened out the walls,

842
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:10,100
it would have made all
the difference in the world.

843
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,967
Now, is there pineapple
in here?

This is
a good cereal treat.

any of the pineapple

from the top

to smash these down

a little weight on them,

to hold themselves up

about Bryn's castle

was the fun rocks

was very simple,

00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,800
This is gonna be amazing.

934
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,567
In 2 hours,
everybody did something.

935
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,133
You know,
they'd flavored something.

936
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,833
I feel like Bryn
did the bare minimum.

937
00:38:27,833 --> 00:38:30,433
I will say that Bryn managed
to get four walls up,

938
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:34,633
and Abby did not,
and her arch fell over.

939
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:36,800
Abby and her great
collapsing castle, you know,

940
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,833
she only had two turrets,
and one of the walls

941
00:38:39,833 --> 00:38:41,200
was just, you know,
ready to go.

942
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,800
And that was a really
disappointing castle.

943
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,700
You know what I was
really disappointed in?

944
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:49,067
She stacked up all of her
pineapple upside-down cakes

945
00:38:49,067 --> 00:38:50,300
one on top of the other.

946
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:53,133
That's not how
you serve those.

947
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:57,067
So only three of these bakers
are gonna get to go

948
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,500
to the finale next week.

949
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:00,867
-Ay-yi-yi.
-I think the question is,

950
00:39:00,867 --> 00:39:03,533
which bakers had
the least flaws today?

951
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,067
We got to make
that decision.

952
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:12,433
**

953
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:16,133
Bakers, you gave us
a heck of a Beach Day,

954
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:19,533
but there was only
one baker that delivered

955
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:22,200
on both design
and flavor.

956
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:24,700
Alex.

957
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:27,067
-Oh, really?
-Nice job, Alex.

958
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:29,667
Really.

959
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,300
Yes.

960
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,967
Your s'mores sandcastle
was cleverly designed

961
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:36,267
and really good,

962
00:39:36,267 --> 00:39:39,300
and the sablé crust
on your piña colada tarts,

963
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,633
crispy, buttery
and delicious.

964
00:39:42,633 --> 00:39:43,833
Thank you.

965
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:44,967
I'm serious, man.

966
00:39:44,967 --> 00:39:46,833
You should package
and sell those walls.

967
00:39:46,833 --> 00:39:48,133
-Really? Maybe I should.
-Seriously.

968
00:39:48,133 --> 00:39:49,067
Maybe I will.

969
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:51,467
Talk to me after.
I got a guy.

970
00:39:51,467 --> 00:39:52,467
Congratulations, Alex.

971
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,400
We will see you
in the finale.

972
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,567
I am in the finale, last boy
standing in the finale,

973
00:39:58,567 --> 00:40:02,267
first Canadian in the finale.

974
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:04,000
Feels really good.

975
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,100
-Good job.
-Thank you.

976
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:10,767
Now that leaves Abby,
Bryn and Linsey.

977
00:40:10,767 --> 00:40:13,500
Please step forward.

978
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,933
Today was all about earning
a spot in the finale.

979
00:40:17,933 --> 00:40:20,033
Unfortunately, each one
of you did have issues.

980
00:40:20,033 --> 00:40:23,033
ABBY: It is very nerve-racking
to know

981
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:25,500
that any one of us
could go home

982
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,667
because we are
all amazing bakers

983
00:40:27,667 --> 00:40:29,600
and have become best friends.

984
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,367
Abby, the walls of your
fruit-cereal castle

985
00:40:33,367 --> 00:40:34,733
were too high,

986
00:40:34,733 --> 00:40:38,400
and that left them
leaning really badly,

987
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,700
and your little pineapple
upside-down cakes,

988
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:41,900
although they tasted good,

989
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:45,033
they were torn up from
sticking to the pan.

990
00:40:45,033 --> 00:40:47,700
Bryn...

991
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,833
you made a really decent
simple sugar cookie

992
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:52,933
and an uneven,
wobbly castle.

993
00:40:54,933 --> 00:40:57,033
We didn't taste pineapple
in your cookie,

994
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:59,400
and using it as a garnish
on your cereal treat

995
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,633
really didn't work
for us.

996
00:41:02,633 --> 00:41:06,733
Linsey, your castle was
rather dark

997
00:41:06,733 --> 00:41:09,133
and foreboding.

998
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:10,900
We liked the graham-cracker
sand idea,

999
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,633
but your berry-pineapple
hand pies

1000
00:41:13,633 --> 00:41:16,367
were definitely
not sweet enough.

1001
00:41:16,367 --> 00:41:18,533
Each and every one of you

1002
00:41:18,533 --> 00:41:21,600
are incredibly
gifted bakers,

1003
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:25,733
and you've become part
of our "Kids Baking" family.

1004
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:30,200
But unfortunately, the baker
leaving us today is...

1005
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:35,167
**

1006
00:41:35,167 --> 00:41:36,967
...Bryn.

1007
00:41:36,967 --> 00:41:38,833
I'm sorry.

1008
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,067
Bryn, you're the best.

1009
00:41:40,067 --> 00:41:42,533
You are
the sweetest, Bryn.

1010
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:44,067
I don't like it.
-Yeah.

1011
00:41:44,067 --> 00:41:46,867
**

1012
00:41:46,867 --> 00:41:49,433
I'm really proud of myself
that I made it this far.

1013
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:51,300
Good luck.

1014
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,533
We all have bad days sometimes,

1015
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,700
but if I see
a sandcastle standing,

1016
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,567
I'm gonna kick it over.

1017
00:41:58,567 --> 00:42:03,067
Bakers, you are
in the finale.

1018
00:42:03,067 --> 00:42:05,133
-Yes.
-Guys, we did it.

1019
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:06,700
Booyah.

1020
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,333
ABBY: Finale!

﻿1
00:00:08,533 --> 00:00:10,267
VALERIE: Previously on
"Kids Baking Championship"...

2
00:00:10,267 --> 00:00:14,767
Cereal treat sand castles
filled with yummy baked goods.

3
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:16,267
With pineapple in it.

4
00:00:16,267 --> 00:00:18,700
Your stuff has to
hold together.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,667
Did not get an pineapple.

6
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:21,733
-It's...
-S'mores.

7
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,433
S'mores in a cereal treat.

8
00:00:23,433 --> 00:00:25,167
-Well done, you.
-Thank you.

9
00:00:25,167 --> 00:00:28,300
There was only one baker
that delivered

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,033
on both design and flavor.

11
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:33,967
Alex.

12
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:36,833
The baker leaving us
today is...

13
00:00:36,833 --> 00:00:38,767
...Bryn.

14
00:00:38,767 --> 00:00:44,200
**

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,200
DUFF: They have no idea what
they're about to get into.

16
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,433
They're gonna love
this challenge.

17
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:48,533
-Yeah.
-They're gonna love it.

18
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:51,900
**

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,400
-What the heck?
-Oh, my goodness.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,200
-Wow!
-That's so many balloons.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,233
I am in the finale,
and this is, like,

22
00:00:58,233 --> 00:01:00,567
the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

23
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:02,733
This is the most balloons
I've seen in one place.

24
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,233
-I just want to pop them all.
-Exactly.

25
00:01:06,233 --> 00:01:09,067
-Hi.
-Hi.

26
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:10,067
Welcome to the finale.

27
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:11,800
Whoo!

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,067
Finale!

29
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:15,767
Woot, woot!

30
00:01:15,767 --> 00:01:17,633
I can't believe it.

31
00:01:17,633 --> 00:01:19,600
You have baked your hearts
out for nine weeks,

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,333
and it definitely feels like
it's time to celebrate.

33
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,633
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes.

34
00:01:23,633 --> 00:01:28,067
But this celebration
is not for you.

35
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:29,933
-Mm.
-Oh, okay.

36
00:01:29,933 --> 00:01:32,933
Guess whose
birthday it is, bakers?

37
00:01:32,933 --> 00:01:34,133
Food Network?

38
00:01:34,133 --> 00:01:36,800
**

39
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,133
"Food Network Magazine."

40
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,767
-Oh!
-Really?

41
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:42,767
"Food Network Magazine"
is 10 years old,

42
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,100
a decade of greatness,

43
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,667
and guess who gets to
make the birthday cake?

44
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,967
-[ Gasps ]
-You.

45
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:53,800
-Aw.
-You.

46
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,300
No pressure, but the winning
cake must be good enough

47
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,700
to represent a magazine

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,067
with nearly
14 million readers.

49
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:04,133
Holy smokes.

50
00:02:04,133 --> 00:02:05,967
Minds blown.

51
00:02:05,967 --> 00:02:08,767
[ Laughs ]

52
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:13,433
Oh, and by the way, the cake
itself is worth $25,000

53
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,733
and the title of
Kids Baking Champion.

54
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,233
Oh, my gosh.

55
00:02:18,233 --> 00:02:21,633
I can probably get, like,
100 dogs with $25,000,

56
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,433
but I only want one.

57
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:28,100
We are giving you five hours to
create birthday cake magic --

58
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,633
-Oh, my goodness.
-Okay, okay, okay.

59
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:32,333
...and we want your cakes
illustrate the color

60
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:35,067
and richness
of "Food Network Magazine."

61
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,200
Okay.

62
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,167
By the end of today,

63
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:41,167
one of you will be

64
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,833
the Kids Baking Champion.

65
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,800
-Oh, my god.
-Oh, my god.

66
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,767
One of us, guys.

67
00:02:46,767 --> 00:02:48,067
All right, bakers.

68
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:51,167
Your baking time starts...

69
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:52,700
...now!
-Now!

70
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,433
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

00:02:54,433 --> 00:02:57,600
**

72
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,500
I need cinnamon.

73
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:03,567
I am in the finale,
so I am going to bring it today.

74
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:08,067
I'm making an ultimate
pumpkin spice cake.

75
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:11,133
I really wanna wow the judges
with sophisticated flavor,

76
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,867
and I think pumpkin spice cake

77
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:16,100
with an orange cream cheese
frosting is pretty darn good.

78
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,233
I'm thinking of a whole
bunch of colors.

79
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,600
Then, probably on the top,
I'm gonna put,

80
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,067
"Happy 10th birthday,
'Food Network Magazine.'"

81
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:25,933
To get my cake started,
I pour in butter in the mixer,

82
00:03:25,933 --> 00:03:29,200
and I take some granulated
sugar and brown sugar,

83
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,367
put in my pumpkin purée.

84
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:35,300
I mix a lot of eggs
and a lot of milk.

85
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,067
For my dry mixture,
I have flour, baking powder,

86
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:41,800
baking soda, and salt.

87
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,133
Okay. Now my spices.

88
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:46,233
I add all my spices
to my dry mixture.

89
00:03:46,233 --> 00:03:48,967
I have ground cinnamon,
ground cloves,

90
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:53,300
ground allspice, ground nutmeg,
and ground ginger.

91
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
There's a lot of spices in this.

92
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,600
No wonder it's called
pumpkin spice.

93
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,400
I alternate between my dry
mixture and my wet mixture.

94
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,833
I don't want to put
all my wet mixture,

95
00:04:03,833 --> 00:04:05,367
or my butter will curdle.

96
00:04:05,367 --> 00:04:07,167
If I was to put
all my dry mixture,

97
00:04:07,167 --> 00:04:09,233
it just won't be
the right texture.

98
00:04:09,233 --> 00:04:13,267
Mm. That smells so good.

99
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:14,900
Abby, what are you making?

100
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,933
I'm making a vanilla bean cake

101
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:21,067
with strawberry buttercream
and lime buttercream.

102
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:23,067
Ooh, that sounds delicious.

103
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:26,667
First, I'm getting started
on my vanilla bean cake batter.

104
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:28,367
That's a lot of butter.

105
00:04:28,367 --> 00:04:32,300
I'm quadrupling my cake recipe

106
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,067
because my cake is going to be
two tiers tall.

107
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,400
First tier is going
to be fondant

108
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,367
and the second tier, sprinkles.

109
00:04:41,367 --> 00:04:43,467
Instead of adding
vanilla extract,

110
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:46,633
I'm going to add in vanilla
beans to my cake batter

111
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,300
because vanilla beans
are very expensive,

112
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:52,267
and my mom doesn't like
to buy them for me,

113
00:04:52,267 --> 00:04:56,067
so I want to use
as many as I can.

114
00:04:56,067 --> 00:05:01,200
I'm making way too much batter
to fit in this bowl,

115
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,367
so I've dumped it
into another bowl

116
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:07,567
so I can just mix it by hand

117
00:05:07,567 --> 00:05:12,567
and hopefully get
everything incorporated.

118
00:05:12,567 --> 00:05:16,167
-That is one full bowl.
-Uh-huh.

119
00:05:16,167 --> 00:05:18,067
Abby, what is that?

120
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,800
Cake batter.

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
So you're making just
a little, tiny cake?

122
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,100
-Yep.
-[ Chuckles ]

123
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,400
No, it's gonna be big.

124
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,533
This bowl still isn't
quite big enough.

125
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:32,800
This calls for
the jumbo metal bowl.

126
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,133
This'll work.

127
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,967
**

128
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,500
Four.

129
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,400
Linsey, what kind of cake
are you making?

130
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,233
I'm making a chocolate cake,
and I'm going to have, like,

131
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,533
a coconut filling
and raspberry buttercream.

132
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,633
-Oh, that sounds good.
-Okay.

133
00:05:47,633 --> 00:05:49,633
This is the one challenge
where we get to make

134
00:05:49,633 --> 00:05:52,400
whatever flavor cake we want,
and I love chocolate.

135
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,167
It's my favorite thing
in the entire world,

136
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,167
and now I get to make
a chocolate cake,

137
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,067
and I also think that
coconut and raspberry

138
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,467
are two flavors that go well
together and with chocolate.

139
00:06:00,467 --> 00:06:03,067
I'm gonna make
a dark chocolate cake

140
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,900
with a marble fondant,

141
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,467
and, just,
I'm making it two tiers.

142
00:06:08,467 --> 00:06:13,067
To make my chocolate cake,
I use oil instead of butter

143
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:16,167
because it will keep
the cake moist,

144
00:06:16,167 --> 00:06:17,700
and I add in some
coffee extract

145
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,100
because coffee helps bring out
the flavor of chocolate,

146
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,067
and I want this chocolate cake
to be the most chocolaty cake

147
00:06:24,067 --> 00:06:25,700
that there is out there.

148
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,767
Bring out the flavor
of the chocolate because,

149
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:30,200
dude, this cake
needs to be so perfect

150
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,533
that it's worth $25,000.

151
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:35,667
I have made this cake
so many times before,

152
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:39,567
and I love making it,
and I love eating it, too.

153
00:06:39,567 --> 00:06:41,433
Well, chocolate
comes from a tree,

154
00:06:41,433 --> 00:06:44,667
so technically it's,
like, a vegetable.

155
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:46,267
-Hi, Linsey.
-Hi.

156
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,067
Have you always loved
decorating cakes?

157
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:50,200
Because I've noticed you've got
quite a skill for decorating.

158
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,733
I love decorating cakes.

159
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:55,700
I don't make them too often
because my mom doesn't like

160
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:58,667
when we have, like,
so much cake in the house.

161
00:06:58,667 --> 00:07:00,733
[ Laughs ] I get it. I get
your mom. I can tell, yeah.
Yeah.

162
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:03,633
All right, well, I'm really
excited to see your cake.

163
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:04,933
Thank you.

164
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:07,200
I really don't want there
to be giant air pockets

165
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,867
or air bubbles in the cake,

166
00:07:10,867 --> 00:07:14,100
so I bang it on the counter

167
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,567
in order to bring all
those air bubbles up

168
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:17,467
so they kind of
just go up and pop.

I'm too small to transport
my cakes by myself.

172

Yeah, because you had,
like, so many layers.
Yeah.

My orange cream cheese frosting.

00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,733
I need a lot of cream cheese.

180
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,967
I take my cream cheese
and butter, cream it together.

181
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:54,400
I add a lot of powdered sugar.

Got my nostrils. Ugh.

185
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,700
I'm putting a little bit
of heavy cream

186
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,533
because I need to thin
it out a little bit,

187
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:12,433
and then I zest some orange,
add some orange extract.

188
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,767
Not too much 'cause, yeah,

189
00:08:13,767 --> 00:08:15,567
I don't want it to be
overpowering.

190
00:08:15,567 --> 00:08:17,133

pillowy heaven in a bowl.

pounds and pounds

193

and pounds of buttercream.

194
00:08:25,367 --> 00:08:27,700
I know. It's crazy.

195
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,200
Now it's time to start
my raspberry buttercream.

00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,867
Just going to sift everything,

197
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:34,067
and this is gonna take a while.

198
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:37,467
Then I start sifting my sugar
'cause I don't want any lumps.

199
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:40,067

everywhere.

but I cannot give the judges
lumpy buttercream.

00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:53,700
Okay.

206
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,300
I finally get done sifting my
sugar, so I add it to my butter.

207
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,167
Then, instead of adding milk,
I add raspberry purée

208
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:04,200
because I want it
to taste like raspberry.

209
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,800
I'm gonna add some lemon
for tartness.

I decide to add a little bit
of tartness,

211
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:14,267
so I put in lemon zest
and a little bit of lemon juice.

Abby, what would you do
if you won the $25,000?

I'm gonna take
my family on a cruise

was mixed with the butter.

I'm also going to make lime
buttercream with lime juice,

green and yellow food coloring

black dots in my buttercream,

What else could I do other
than cream cheese frosting

265
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,700
and a cake?

266
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:47,133
Maybe pastry cream, I'll do,
like, some crème pâtissière.

267
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,367
Pastry cream
or crème pâtissière,

268
00:11:48,367 --> 00:11:50,200
whatever you want to call it.

269
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,767
I'm currently working on
orange spice pastry cream

270
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:58,467
that I'm gonna fill
the middle of my cakes with.

271
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,800
I heat up some milk with some
cornstarch and orange extract,

272
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,433
just a little bit, not too much,

273
00:12:03,433 --> 00:12:08,133
because I don't want it
to overpower all those spices.

274
00:12:08,133 --> 00:12:10,400
I start to temper my eggs
and my sugar.

275
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,300
I'm whisking like crazy

276
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,333
because I don't want
to get scrambled eggs.

277
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:16,900
Ah. That's quite the workout.

278
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,567
Okay.

279
00:12:18,567 --> 00:12:21,833
Pastry cream is all thickened,
and then I add ginger, cinnamon,

280
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,867
cloves, nutmeg...

281
00:12:23,867 --> 00:12:25,500
An 1/8th of a teaspoon.

282
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,800
...allspice, cardamom
and apple pie spice.

283
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,067
That's seven spices,
so the judges better like it.

284
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:34,700
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

285
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,633
Alex, what would you do
if you won the $25,000?

286
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:42,867
I think I'll probably buy
a stand mixer and get a dog,

287
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,433
like, in the future.

288
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:46,300
Yeah, I would buy a dog, too.

289
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,400
Yeah.
I think I'll get a beagle.

290
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,367
I don't think beagles
will be very happy

291
00:12:50,367 --> 00:12:51,667
with the winters in Canada,

292
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:54,133
but I know they're
gonna love me.

293
00:12:54,133 --> 00:12:55,667
I'd get a Maltese.

294
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,400
I'm, like, allergic
to most dogs --
Oh.

295
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:00,467
...and I'm not allergic
to that one at all.

296
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:03,367
So I need to start making
my coconut filling.

297
00:13:03,367 --> 00:13:06,267
I take some coconut milk,
sweetened condensed milk,

298
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:09,733
and a little bit
of cream of coconut,

299
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:11,433
and I've got my coconut filling.

300
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:14,067
Ooh, that is coconut-y
to the max.

301

302
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,433
Oh, that was so satisfying.

303
00:13:19,433 --> 00:13:22,167
I take my cake leveler
and level my cakes.

304
00:13:22,167 --> 00:13:23,733
Actually, that's a good height.

305
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,700
I need to level them because
they'll be easier

306
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,267
to stack that way,

307
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:30,967
and I'll just have cleaner,
straight, even layers.

308
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:34,700
Please be baked okay.

309
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,833
Yes. Oh.

310
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:40,200
This is the most satisfying
thing in the world.

311
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,500
Peeling the parchment
paper off...

312
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,067
Oh, that was so satisfying.

313
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,133
...is, like, the best.

314
00:13:46,133 --> 00:13:47,500
I poke holes in the cake,

315
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,967

on the coconut filling.

317
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,100
All right.
Let me get a turntable.

318
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,533
Now I have to start
assembling my cake.

319
00:13:57,533 --> 00:14:01,300
I put on a thin layer
of raspberry buttercream.

320
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,800
I repeat that
for all the layers,

321
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,200
and then I crumb coat and chill.

322
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,133
I assemble my bottom tier
of four layers

323
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:13,100
and then my top tier
of three layers.

324
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,433
Hey, our faces should be
on this cover.

I have never made a cake
that has to be worth $25,000.

330
00:14:35,533 --> 00:14:38,300
I made a cake for my library,

331
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,800
but that was just
for a $15 gift card.

332
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,067
Alex, how many layers
are you making your cake?

333
00:14:45,067 --> 00:14:47,067
I'm making my cake
actually two tiers

334
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:49,067
and three layers in between.

335
00:14:49,067 --> 00:14:50,333
That's what I'm doing, too.

336
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:52,433
I was gonna do four layers,

337
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,667
but I want to be
able to carry it,

338
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:58,400
and if it was four, I think
it would be too heavy.
Oh, okay.

339
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,733
I'm taking one layer
of vanilla cake

340
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,967
and then piping
strawberry buttercream,

341
00:15:02,967 --> 00:15:05,633
and then I'm taking another
layer of vanilla cake

342
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:08,767
and piping lime buttercream
in the middle.

344
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,167
Okay. Let's put you in
the blast chiller.

345
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:16,333
I wanna make sure that I put
enough buttercream

346
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:20,300
in between the layers
because it tastes super good

347
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:23,767
with a lot of buttercream.

348
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:26,967
2 1/2 hours, bakers.

349
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:30,300
Trim it a little bit,
not too much or else my layers

350
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,533
are gonna be way too thin.

351
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,900
I'm starting to trim my cakes
to make them flat,

352
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:40,667
but they are a little too thin,
so I can't trim them too much.

353
00:15:40,667 --> 00:15:42,867
Next, I need to soak
my cakes in simple syrup,

354
00:15:42,867 --> 00:15:45,833
so I just combine equal
parts water and sugar.

355
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:49,067
Put that on the stove
until all the sugar dissolves,

356
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,300
spreading it all over the cake,

357
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,933
and then it will
be nice and moist.

358
00:15:51,933 --> 00:15:53,333
Holy smokes.

359
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:55,467
I take one layer of
the pumpkin spice cake,

360
00:15:55,467 --> 00:15:57,167
and then I get
my spice pastry cream,

361
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:59,767
put it in the middle.

362
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:03,100
As I'm stacking my cake,
it's kind of wobbling around.

Oh.

364
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,433
But it's too late now,

365
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:09,433
so I'm just jamming
frosting inside.

366
00:16:09,433 --> 00:16:13,867
I was hoping maybe it would kind
of stabilize it a little bit.

367
00:16:13,867 --> 00:16:15,067
Holy smokes.

368
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:17,767
This is just a disaster.

369
00:16:17,767 --> 00:16:19,167
It's leaning.

370
00:16:19,167 --> 00:16:21,667
The frosting is melting
a little bit,

371
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:24,600

it's gonna fall over.

00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,600
Oh, that's cool.

439
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,567
I still have a lot
of decorating,

440
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,300
so I'm just going to make
a 10 out of fondant.

441
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,767
I'm rolling out my fondant
super thick

442
00:19:24,767 --> 00:19:30,467
so that way my 10 will stand up
on the top of my cake.

443
00:19:30,467 --> 00:19:31,767
I have some leftover dots,

444
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:33,700
so I'm gonna put them
on my number 10

445
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,267
so they will match all
throughout the cake.

446
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:39,433
You are the best kid
bakers in America

447
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:41,667
and possibly Canada.
-Yeah.

448
00:19:41,667 --> 00:19:44,067
-Let's just say North America.
-Yeah. [ Laughs ]

449
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,833
Shout out to our
Canadian friends.

450
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:48,467
I love Canada.

451
00:19:48,467 --> 00:19:50,067
I do, too.

452
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:55,067
I put the second layer of
the buttercream on my cakes,

453
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,700
ready for the fondant.

454
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,133
All together.

455
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,867
I really want all the colors
on the cake

456
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,600
because "Food Network Magazine"
is very colorful,

457
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,667
so I figure
the best way to do that

458
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,367
is to marble my fondant.

459
00:20:08,367 --> 00:20:10,333
To marble fondant, you need
to roll out tubes

460
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,900
of each of your colors.

461
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,133
You stick them all together
and twirl them.

462
00:20:14,133 --> 00:20:17,767
Roll it into a ball and knead
it to must it all together.

463
00:20:17,767 --> 00:20:21,400
Then, I put it in the sheeter.

464
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,100
[ Gasps] Love the marbling
fondant thing

465
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,733
that Linsey is doing.

466
00:20:25,733 --> 00:20:27,200
You got to be careful
when you're marbling fondant.

467
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,867
-You don't want to overdo it.
-Mm-hmm.

468
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:32,367
If you overdo it,
it just turns kind of gray.
Yeah.

469
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:34,267
I think that this
marbled fondant

470
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:37,333
will really impress the judges.

471
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,133
Oh, it's not big enough.

472
00:20:39,133 --> 00:20:41,200
The sides are not
big enough at all,

473
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,133
but I can't remix it
and reroll it

474
00:20:43,133 --> 00:20:44,267
because then the fondant
is just going to turn,

475
00:20:44,267 --> 00:20:45,700
like, a muddy brown-gray.

476
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,500
I'm just gonna have
to make do with this.

477
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:50,933
It's a little bit messy
and kind of ripping,

478
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,833
but it's the best
I got right now,

479
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:55,700
and it covers the entire cake.

480
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Don't freak out.

481
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,667
Cover up my top tier
and smooth everything out.

482
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,700
It's not like this cake
will determine --

483
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,467
Oh, well, it does.

484
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,867
So I roll out a piece of white
fondant and wrap it around.

485
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:11,267
And make a bow with some white
fondant, place it on,

486
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:13,300
and it looks like
a nice little present.

487
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,200
I'll just put a border
around the bottom.

488
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,467
On a scale of 1 to 10,
what's your stress level?

489
00:21:18,467 --> 00:21:20,800
Mm, five.

490
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,467
-Five?
-Yeah.

491
00:21:22,467 --> 00:21:24,167
Five?

492
00:21:24,167 --> 00:21:27,100
Mine's, like, a seven,
and I'm just standing here.

Scared as heck.

495
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,067
I'm trying to cover
a 10-inch cake.

496
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,433
That needs a lot of fondant,

497
00:21:36,433 --> 00:21:40,533
so I'm taking about
four bags of fondant.

498
00:21:40,533 --> 00:21:44,933
I have to literally put almost
all my weight onto this fondant

499
00:21:44,933 --> 00:21:46,133
just so it rolls out.

500
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:48,100
I need more strength.

501
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,300
This stuff is so hard.

502
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,700
[ Speaks indistinctly ]
...fondant rolled out.

503
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:57,267
I have passed nine weeks of big
bakes to get to the finale.

504
00:21:57,267 --> 00:22:01,600
I am not gonna give
up this time.

505
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:02,733
Come on.

506
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:05,533
Oh, maybe I might just --
Maybe I got it.

507
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:10,400
I know it's not perfect,
but I just have to roll with it.

508
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,067
With the holes,
I'm just gonna cover them

509
00:22:12,067 --> 00:22:14,800
in these little
red polka dots,

510
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,533
and then I'm thinking
I'm just gonna do, like,

511
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:19,100
a little ribbon
to represent, like, a gift.

512
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,633
I put my red polka
dots on there,

513
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:23,733
and I think it looks
pretty good.

514
00:22:23,733 --> 00:22:26,800
My 6-inch fondant is coming out
so much better than my 10-inch

515
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,233
because it's a smaller cake.

516
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:29,467
It's easier to cover it.

517
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:30,800
I need to cover this cardboard

518
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,167
because Duff does not
like cardboard.

519
00:22:33,167 --> 00:22:34,500
Who would love cardboard?

520
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,933
I don't know.

521
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:37,833
I have to get this done
'cause I still have to make

522
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,867
that number 10 cake topper.

523
00:22:39,867 --> 00:22:43,567
I just need to cover that first.

524
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,767
Now that my dots are all
on my first tier,

525
00:22:45,767 --> 00:22:48,267
it's time to get started
on my second tier.

526
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,667
I'm going to roll it
in sprinkles.

527
00:22:50,667 --> 00:22:53,133
I'm adding a lot of frosting
so that way,

528
00:22:53,133 --> 00:22:54,567
when I roll it in sprinkles,

529
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:59,200
they'll have plenty
of room to stick.

530
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,233
That's an amazing method
that Abby's got right there.

531
00:23:02,233 --> 00:23:03,600
Yeah, it's a cool technique
because, you know,

532
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,733
you got a cake
with no decoration on it.

533
00:23:05,733 --> 00:23:08,133
Ten seconds later, you have
a cake that looks amazing.
Yeah.

534

535
00:23:10,867 --> 00:23:12,333
Boom.

536
00:23:12,333 --> 00:23:13,733
Well, that was fun.

537
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:15,733
Abby, what are you
using for your 10?

538
00:23:15,733 --> 00:23:17,267
Fondant.

539
00:23:17,267 --> 00:23:18,833
I'm doing rice cereal treats.

540
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,067
I know the other two girls
are doing fondant, like,

541
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,500
just fondant,
and they said edible,

542
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,233
so I'm thinking
rice cereal treats.

543
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:28,367
I'd like something a little
bit more edible

544
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:29,467
as opposed to just fondant.
-For the 10?

545
00:23:29,467 --> 00:23:31,067
But, you know,
in the world of cakes,

546
00:23:31,067 --> 00:23:32,633
you don't care about what
the topper tastes like.
Right.

547
00:23:32,633 --> 00:23:34,533
You want to make sure
it really holds up well.

548
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,867
-And really looks good.
-Yeah.

549
00:23:36,867 --> 00:23:39,633
I dip my one and zero
in the white chocolate

550
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:43,367
and then kind of like almost
bread it in my sprinkles.

551
00:23:43,367 --> 00:23:44,933
I put them in the blast
chiller for a little bit

552
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:47,367
so that white chocolate
can kind of solidify.

553
00:23:47,367 --> 00:23:49,333
15 minutes left, bakers.

554
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:53,500
What can you do to make
your cake really stand out?

555
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,167
Well, it's "Food Network
Magazine"'s birthday.

556
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:58,167
Usually, on a birthday cake,
there's candles.

557
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:02,133
I'm gonna make 10 candles.

558
00:24:02,133 --> 00:24:05,133
So I'm going to make candles.

559
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,333
This will also be a candle.

560
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:10,333
You need 10 candles 'cause
it's the 10th birthday.

561
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,667
I'm going to pipe a border.

562
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:14,800
Let's get a tip.

563
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,533
10 minutes, guys.

564
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:19,133
Ooh, this is going to be
a good little showdown.

565
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:22,300
It's very close.

566
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:26,367
I'm piping a buttercream border
because it will draw

567
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:28,500
the whole cake together,

568
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:34,100
and also it will cover up
the seams where the cakes meet.

569
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,600
Mm...

570
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:40,367
Something just doesn't
look finished about it.

571
00:24:40,367 --> 00:24:44,567
Glitter is awesome because
it makes everything sparkly,

572
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:48,533
and some little pearl
sprinkles are super cute

573
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:52,333
and would add the perfect
detail to my birthday cake.

574
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:57,067
Six minutes, bakers,

my one and my zero

off the cooling rack,
but they are really frozen.

-Four minutes.
-Oh, jeez.

585
00:25:22,933 --> 00:25:24,667
Why is this happening to me?

586
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:28,333
I'm not gonna finish.
I don't think I will.

587
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:32,267
I have some extra, so I quickly
whip up another one.

588
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:33,533
I take my zero off,

589
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,167
and I need to be
really delicate.

590
00:25:35,167 --> 00:25:38,833
Oh, my god. I got it. Yes!

591
00:25:38,833 --> 00:25:40,267
I got it off.

592
00:25:40,267 --> 00:25:42,767
There we go, mister zero.

593
00:25:42,767 --> 00:25:45,267
I realize that I should put
"happy birthday" on here,

594
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:49,267
so I grab a red edible,
edible, marker,

595
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:51,367
and then I write,
"Happy birthday."

596

On the cake,
there's only a zero.

It's not the birth of
"Food Network Magazine."

so I need to get a one done.

[ Laughs ] Awesome, awesome.
Tell us about your cake.

632
00:27:25,467 --> 00:27:28,400
I wanted my cake to be rainbow

633
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,733
because that reminds me
of birthdays and parties,

634
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,767
and the balloon wall
was super awesome,

635
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:37,067
and I wanted my cake
to kind of look like that.

636
00:27:37,067 --> 00:27:38,767
Cool.
Tell us about your number 10.

How did you make that?

638
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:43,333
My number 10 is made
out of fondant.

639
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,967
-Just straight fondant?
-Yep.

-Technically, it's edible.
-Yeah.

Abby,
that cake is spectacular.

642
00:27:50,767 --> 00:27:54,333
Anybody having a 10th
birthday would love

643
00:27:54,333 --> 00:27:56,067
to have that cake
in front of them.

644
00:27:56,067 --> 00:28:00,167
I love that you chose two
different looks for each tier

645
00:28:00,167 --> 00:28:02,433
and your rosettes
all the way around,

each having a little
pearl inside to show

647

that they're all
these little flowers.

648
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:08,733
It was so meticulous.

649
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,567
I can tell you really put
a lot of thought into this.

650
00:28:11,567 --> 00:28:14,367
I'm absolutely blown
away by this cake.

651
00:28:14,367 --> 00:28:16,200
I think the technique
of rolling the cake

652
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,067
in the sprinkles
was really good.

653
00:28:18,067 --> 00:28:19,600
You know, it's nice and even.

654
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,300
I think your fondant is really
clean, and I love the glitter.

655
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:24,567
I put glitter on everything.

with lime buttercream,
strawberry buttercream,

661
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,067

in vanilla buttercream.

That's lots of
buttercream, huh?
Yep.

That's, like, a one-to-one
buttercream-to-cake ratio.

Very lime-y. I like that.

670
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:03,900
That buttercream is lime-y,
and that other buttercream

671
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,767
is strawberry-y,

672
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,367
and your cake is vanillla-y,

673
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:12,333
and it's all really
good, big flavors.

674
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:15,867
It's definitely a bit dry.
It's not, like, super dry.

675

It's not like, "Oh, god, I feel
like I'm eating a cracker,"

676
00:29:18,633 --> 00:29:20,333
but it could definitely
be a little more moist.

677
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,867
Don't be afraid
to soak your cakes.

678
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:24,533
Some syrup in there, it really
makes a big difference.

679
00:29:24,533 --> 00:29:26,200

disappointing because

it's such a gorgeous cake,

and the buttercream
is so flavorful,

682
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:33,733

a little on the dry side.

love pumpkin spice cake,

My cake is inspired
by "Food Network Magazine."

I have a whole bunch
of colors on there

700
00:30:14,667 --> 00:30:17,200
because if you look at the cover
of "Food Network Magazine,"

701
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,600
you see a whole
bunch of colors.

702

if you got your own spread

"Food Network Magazine"
about Alex?

708
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:30,433

the first Canadian

710
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,400

as the winner would be

just a whole different --

712
00:30:38,033 --> 00:30:39,800
It would be amazing.

713
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,300
Well, listen, Alex,
I think that, you know,

714
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,933
your cake is kind of
sitting a little wonky,

715
00:30:43,933 --> 00:30:46,533
sitting a little funny,
but it has a lot of character,

716
00:30:46,533 --> 00:30:48,067
and I think character
counts for something.

717
00:30:48,067 --> 00:30:49,600
Oh.

718
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,467
You know, I mean, technically,
it's not perfect.
Yeah, I know.

719
00:30:51,467 --> 00:30:53,967
There's a big wrinkle
I can see right here.
Mm-hmm.

720
00:30:53,967 --> 00:30:57,067
I think the flat polka dots
is probably not the best thing

721
00:30:57,067 --> 00:30:58,567
to cover up that seam with

722
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:01,900
because they have to sort of,
like, bend in there,

723
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,167
and they kind of --
You know what I mean?
Oh, yeah.

724
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:04,500
But I like all the colors,

725
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,867
and you know what I think
my favorite part is?

726
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:10,233
The zero because it looks
like a giant donut --
Oh, really?

727
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:11,700
...and it's for
"Food Network Magazine,"

728
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,800
so there should be
some food on there.
Yeah.

writing on top of the cake

been nice to see

more artistic effort --

are in there,

afraid of the spices.

You just pounded away
on those spices here,

I wish that there was a little
bit more frosting

cream cheese with pumpkin,

is lovely,

to be enough of that either.

Okay.

cream on top of that.
Oh.

You would have had cake,
cream cheese frosting,

would've had it,

00:33:12,233 --> 00:33:16,667
The taste was there,
and the decoration, it was okay,

783
00:33:16,667 --> 00:33:19,400
so maybe I might have a shot
at winning this thing, maybe.

786
00:33:27,733 --> 00:33:30,467
DUFF: 10th birthday cake
for "Food Network Magazine."

787
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,600
That's so cute with
the candles.

788
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:36,367
The final judging, it's really
crazy that I got to this point,

789
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:38,300
and I'm just really nervous.

790
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,100
-Fun.
-It is fun.

791
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:41,633
-A lot of fun.
-Yeah, a lot of colors.

792
00:33:41,633 --> 00:33:43,600
I love the logo.

793
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,867
My heart is just beating really
fast and just shaking a bit.

794
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:49,800
Hey, Linsey.

796
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,367
-Hi.
-Hi.

797
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:57,067
How did you feel today?

798
00:33:57,067 --> 00:33:58,533
I feel pretty good.

799
00:33:58,533 --> 00:34:01,467
Did you ever think that
when you started nine weeks ago

800
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,300
that you'd be standing
here in the finale?

801
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,733
I did not think I'd be here
in the finale at all.

802
00:34:06,733 --> 00:34:08,233
Really?

803
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,500
I didn't think I would just last
this long, and it's really cool.

804
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,600
-All right. [ Chuckles ]
-[ Chuckles ]

805
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,267
So, Linsey, tell us
about your cake

806
00:34:13,267 --> 00:34:14,700
and the inspiration behind it.

807
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,567
So today I made a chocolate cake
with a creamy

808
00:34:18,567 --> 00:34:21,900
coconut filling
and a raspberry buttercream.

809
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,267
I made a chocolate cake
because this entire competition,

810
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:27,267
I haven't really had
a big chance to make, like,

811
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:29,233
chocolaty desserts,
and chocolate

812
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:31,333
is, like, my favorite thing
in the entire world,

813
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:33,733
and also, for decoration,
I used marbled fondant

814
00:34:33,733 --> 00:34:35,833
because I feel like
the "Food Network Magazine"

815
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:40,267
is always really colorful
and interesting, so...

816
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,500
You know, we're celebrating
"Food Network Magazine"'s

817
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:42,800
10th birthday,

818
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,600
and that is a celebration cake
if I ever seen one.

819
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,100
It definitely looks like
a birthday cake.

820
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:51,067
It is so classy and beautiful.

821
00:34:51,067 --> 00:34:54,100
I love that you made
a Food Network logo.

822
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:56,067
That's a lot of fun,
and you did a really,

823
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:57,500
really great job with it.

824
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:00,067
I love that you put
candles up there.

825
00:35:00,067 --> 00:35:01,433
And I'm looking at your cake,

826
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:06,500
and it is whoosh, whoosh,
whoosh, totally straight --

827
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,867
-That looks great.
-Mm-hmm.

828
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:09,167
Thank you.

829
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:11,233
...but there's only
eight candles.

830
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:14,233
Oh, the Food Network
symbol is two.

831
00:35:14,233 --> 00:35:15,933
No, I counted,
even with those two.

832
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:19,100

833
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,367
-Oh.
-[ Laughs ]

834
00:35:20,367 --> 00:35:22,767
I thought I made more.

835
00:35:22,767 --> 00:35:24,067
D'oh.

836
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,767
Doy! [ Laughs ]

837
00:35:25,767 --> 00:35:29,333
The marbling is beautiful, but
there's a few technical flaws.

838
00:35:29,333 --> 00:35:31,233
There's some rips
on the bottom cake.

839
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:33,300
-Mm-hmm.
-It's dried out in places.

840
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,067
Yeah, I love the marbling.

841
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,600
I think it's a really
fun technique.

842
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,533
A little bit less kneading
of the fondant

843
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:40,300
and I think it would
have been a little brighter

844
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,500
'cause once those colors start
to mix, they get a little muddy.

845
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,967
-Yeah.
-I love that you attempted it.

846
00:35:44,967 --> 00:35:47,167
Oh, yeah. It's cool.

847
00:35:47,167 --> 00:35:50,067
-Let's taste it.
-All right.

848
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:52,367
Please, please
just like the cake.

849
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:58,533
Please, I'm begging you.

850
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,900
Creamy coconut.

851
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,133
Mm-hmm.

852
00:36:01,133 --> 00:36:05,067
**

853
00:36:05,067 --> 00:36:07,700
Very raspberry. Mm.

854
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,967
Nice tartness to it.

855
00:36:08,967 --> 00:36:11,167
Yeah, I added a bit of lemon.

856
00:36:11,167 --> 00:36:13,467
I don't taste a ton
of the coconut filling.

857
00:36:13,467 --> 00:36:16,833
All it did was really moisten
your cake quite nicely.

858
00:36:16,833 --> 00:36:19,333
So the coconut filling,
it was more of a soak than a --

859
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:21,067
-Yeah, it was a soak.
-Got you.

860
00:36:21,067 --> 00:36:22,400
I wish there was more
of the coconut.

861
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,767
I could definitely use
more coconut flavor.

862
00:36:24,767 --> 00:36:27,200
I can taste it.
It's really faint --
Okay.

863
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:29,300
...but it has a lot of
good big chocolate flavor,

864
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:30,833
really good raspberry flavor.

865
00:36:30,833 --> 00:36:32,133
It's really nice together.

866
00:36:32,133 --> 00:36:33,567
-Thank you.
-Thank you, Linsey.

867
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:36,067
-Thanks, Linsey.
-Thank you.

868
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:38,067
I thought it was an incredibly
moist chocolate cake.

869
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,967
I'm just a little bit
disappointed in the fondant

870
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:41,267
on the bottom cake,

871
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:43,367
to put all that
work in to marble

872
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,367
and then have it not
quite come out.

873
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,733
I know that everyone else
did a really great job,

874
00:36:48,733 --> 00:36:50,467
so I may not...

875
00:36:50,467 --> 00:36:52,200
I don't think I'll, like, win,

876
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:53,900
but I think I did
a really great job.

878
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,733
We have three amazing
bakers in the finale,

879
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:05,300
and each one of them had
a unique take on a birthday cake

880
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:08,500
for "Food Network
Magazine"'s 10th birthday.

881
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,900
All right.
Let's talk it through.

882
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,900
-All right.
-How about Alex?

883
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:12,600
Spices.

884
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,133
Oh, my goodness.
That cake tasted so good,

885
00:37:15,133 --> 00:37:17,067
might've been
the best bite of the day.

886
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:19,233
Listen, that was
a very moist cake.

887
00:37:19,233 --> 00:37:22,333
It was very sophisticated,
pumpkin, spices.

888
00:37:22,333 --> 00:37:24,533
-He made a pastry cream.
-Yeah.

889
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,500
I like his festive
10 on top, too.

890
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,600
I like the zero because
it looked like a donut.
[ Laughs ]

891
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:33,067
But his decorating had
a lot to be desired.

892
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:34,867
It was a little rough.

893
00:37:34,867 --> 00:37:38,733
I think Abby's cake was beyond.

894
00:37:38,733 --> 00:37:41,767
I mean, that cake did not look
like a 13-year-old did it.

895
00:37:41,767 --> 00:37:44,067
I like how Abby switched up
her techniques,

896
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:47,167
but then she brought them all
together with her piped flower.

897
00:37:47,167 --> 00:37:49,833
And the little pearls
on each one.

898
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:52,067
The strawberry flavor
was really big in Abby's cake.

899
00:37:52,067 --> 00:37:53,700
The lime flavor was really big.

900
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,500
But, whoa, the ratio,

901
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,300
there was almost
more buttercream than cake,

902
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,067
and for me, the biggest
problem with the cake

903
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:01,433
was how dry it was.

904
00:38:01,433 --> 00:38:04,300
It was very
disappointing for me.
Got you.

905
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,067
Linsey's cake, that was
a moist, chocolaty,

906
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,367
delicious slice of cake,

907
00:38:10,367 --> 00:38:13,067
and the raspberry
buttercream with it.

908
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:14,567
I love that cake.

909
00:38:14,567 --> 00:38:16,467
I love the flavor
of Linsey's cake,

910
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:19,467
but I could definitely
use more coconut flavor.

911
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:22,167
Linsey's decorating
had more flaws.

912
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:24,167
She also did more stuff,

913
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,233
and she tried more
advanced things.

914
00:38:26,233 --> 00:38:28,600
-She marbled fondant.
-Wow.

915
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,800
She sculpted fondant
into 3D shapes.

916
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,067
She made candles.

917
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:34,100
She made the Food Network logo,

918
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:37,967
and I have to say Linsey's
cake was a lot tastier.

919
00:38:37,967 --> 00:38:40,333
But Abby's cake was so clean.

920
00:38:40,333 --> 00:38:42,067
It was definitely
for a 10th birthday,

921
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,200
but, you know,
when you think about it,

922
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:48,067
the challenge here was to make
a 10th birthday cake

923
00:38:48,067 --> 00:38:51,267
for "Food Network Magazine."

924
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:54,133
It's this close.

925
00:38:54,133 --> 00:38:57,067
This is only our fourth
Kids Baking Champion.

926
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,733
I want to make
the right decision.

927
00:38:58,733 --> 00:39:00,200
I think we do every year,

928
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,167
and I think
we're going to again.

-No.
-No, not at all.

We started with
12 amazing kid bakers,

and after a series of really
demanding challenges

937

and unexpected twists,

938
00:39:31,567 --> 00:39:35,833

as our finalists.

940
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:42,667
Today, you spent five hours
making the cake of your lives.

941
00:39:42,667 --> 00:39:45,333
Linsey, you made
a sophisticated,

942
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:48,733
moist chocolate cake
with precise, even layers.

943
00:39:48,733 --> 00:39:51,933
You used multiple techniques,
like fondant marbling

944
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:56,067
and sculpting the Food Network
logo, very, very impressive.

945
00:39:56,067 --> 00:39:57,467
Thank you.

946
00:39:57,467 --> 00:40:01,667
Abby, your vanilla bean
cake was gorgeous.

947
00:40:01,667 --> 00:40:04,500
It was neat and clean
and festive with strong,

948

intense flavors,

949
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,267
and your details,
like the meticulous pearls

950

and the tier covered
in sprinkles,

00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,533
really beautiful work.

I mean, we could eat
that cake all day long.

956
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,900
It was so delicious.

957
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:26,267
Thank you.

958
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:27,700
We appreciated your
rice cereal topper,

959
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,100
and the whole thing made
for a really happy cake.

960
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,300
Thank you.

961
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,333
So we had to ask ourselves,

962
00:40:33,333 --> 00:40:35,800
which cake was
the most successful

963
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,267
in meeting the challenge

964
00:40:37,267 --> 00:40:41,000
of celebrating "Food Network
Magazine"'s 10th birthday?

965
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,067
And the thing is, only one
of you can walk out of here

966
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,767
with the title of
Kids Baking Champion

967
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:48,867
and $25,000.

968
00:40:48,867 --> 00:40:51,267
**

969
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:55,300
If I win, every Canadian
will be proud of me.

970
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,133
Super nervous,
this is the most nervous

971
00:40:57,133 --> 00:41:00,600
I've ever been
in my entire life.

972
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,167
In an incredibly
close decision,

973
00:41:03,167 --> 00:41:05,867
like, ridiculously
close, like --

974
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:09,100
"We're not friends
anymore" close.
...splitting hairs,

975
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,600
the winner of

976
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:16,467
"Kids Baking Championship"
is...

977
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:19,067
**

978
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:23,133
Oh, my gosh.

979
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:24,567
DUFF AND VALERIE:
...Linsey!

980
00:41:24,567 --> 00:41:26,933
-Oh, my god.
-Congratulations.

981
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,100
Congratulations, Linsey.

982
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:31,133
You are
the Kids Baking Champion.

983
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:32,133
Congratulations.

984
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:33,267
[ Laughs ]

985
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:35,667
Other than being born,

986
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:39,200
this is the best moment
of my entire life.

987
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,733
-All of you guys --
-So good.

988
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:42,867
-...you're all the best.
-Bring it in. Bring it in.

989
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:45,633
Yay!

990
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,067
Even though I didn't win,
I am so proud of myself

991
00:41:48,067 --> 00:41:49,967
that I made it
to the final three

992
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:52,300
in "Kids Baking Championship."

993
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,600
-You guys have fun?
-Yeah.

994
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,167
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

995
00:41:55,167 --> 00:41:57,900
I still think that I'm a winner
in everyone in Canada's eyes.

996
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,667
Yeah, maybe I might get
a parade when I get home.

997
00:42:00,667 --> 00:42:02,533
-Wow!
-Whoa!

998
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:06,933
I am the Kids Baking Champion.

999
00:42:06,933 --> 00:42:11,600
