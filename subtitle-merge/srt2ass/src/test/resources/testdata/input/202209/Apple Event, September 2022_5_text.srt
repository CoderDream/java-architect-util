Tim Cook: Good morning.

6
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,594
We're so glad you could join us.

7
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:04,198
At Apple, we're fortunate
to be surrounded by people

8
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,400
who strive to innovate together

9
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:11,038
to create products and experiences
that enrich people's lives,

10
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,941
products that are intuitive
and easy to use,

11
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:17,311
that have a unique integration
of hardware and software,

12
00:01:17,344 --> 00:01:19,479
and that are incredibly personal.

13
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:22,816
Today, we're here to talk
about three products

14
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:25,252
that have become essential in our lives:

15
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:28,755
iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch.

16
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:30,457
They're always with you,

17
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,727
useful whenever and wherever
you need them,

18
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,964
and are designed
to work seamlessly together.

19
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:40,300
On their own, each is industry leading.

20
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:43,904
Together, they provide
a magical experience.

21
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:47,140
With one tap,
AirPods are instantly set up

22
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:50,143
and ready to work
with your iPhone and Apple Watch,

23
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:53,447
and automatic switching allows sound
to move seamlessly

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:56,416
between any of your Apple devices.

25
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,888
There's also incredible integration
between iPhone and Apple Watch.

26
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:04,725
Together they provide the convenience
of having your notifications

27
00:02:04,758 --> 00:02:09,463
and messages on your wrist
and available with just a glance.

28
00:02:09,496 --> 00:02:14,101
You can seamlessly hand off phone calls
between your iPhone and Apple Watch,

29
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,937
and you can set your destination
on your iPhone

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:20,541
and your Apple Watch will help guide you
along the way.

31
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:24,378
Users can even get their health
and fitness data from Apple Watch

32
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:27,114
and see it on the Health app
on their iPhone.

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:30,984
These are just a few examples
of the unique and powerful ways

34
00:02:31,018 --> 00:02:34,521
our hardware and software
are designed to work together,

35
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:39,393
enhancing and enriching the experiences
you have with these products.

36
00:02:39,426 --> 00:02:43,864
This type of integration is something
only Apple can do.

37
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:48,035
And today we're going to make
these products and these experiences

38
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,036
even better.

39
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,674
Let's get started
by talking about Apple Watch.

40
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:57,144
Apple Watch has become
an essential companion.

41
00:02:57,177 --> 00:03:02,516
It's always with you, allowing you
to do so much right from your wrist.

42
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:05,953
It keeps you connected to the things
you care about most,

43
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:09,256
encourages you to stay active,
and monitors your health

44
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:11,525
and gets help when you need it.

45
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,127
And I've received thousands of letters
from customers

46
00:03:14,161 --> 00:03:17,598
writing about their personal experiences
using Apple Watch.

47
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:21,435
I'd like to share just a few of
those stories with you now.

48
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,677

Hello, Mr. Cook...

52
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,452
I'm writing to you
from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

53
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,387
I'm writing you from Atlanta, Georgia.

54
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,225
I am a 27-year-old high school teacher.

55
00:03:45,259 --> 00:03:46,760
I'm a senior in high school.

56
00:03:46,793 --> 00:03:49,329
I only had the watch
for two or three weeks.

57
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:56,303
I was viewing a movie with my wife
in our family room...

58
00:03:56,336 --> 00:03:59,273
I was having lunch at one of the spiciest
restaurants in San Diego...

59
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:00,774
It was a typical summer night.

60
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,209
I looked around the corner,

61
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,977
and a bear was staring right at me.

62
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:06,780
I was doing what we call
a dump and return

63
00:04:06,813 --> 00:04:09,283
when I slipped headfirst
into the compactor.

64
00:04:09,316 --> 00:04:12,019
I was skating on a frozen river
when the ice gave out.

65
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:14,755
The door closed, and everything went dark.

66
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,191
My longtime friend
started grasping his chest.

67
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,625
I was fighting to catch my breath.

68
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:21,862
I used the watch to study my pulse,
and it was wildly erratic.

69
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,530
Things escalated quickly from there.

70
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:26,767
I was getting tired, and I could tell
hypothermia was setting in.

71
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,969
I go to grab my phone,
but my pockets were empty.

72
00:04:29,002 --> 00:04:30,437
I didn't have my phone on me.

73
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,739
As I was trying to figure out what to do,

74
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,441
I looked down and saw my watch.

75
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:36,109
I placed my Apple Watch on his wrist,

76
00:04:36,143 --> 00:04:37,978
and I couldn't believe my eyes.

77
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:41,582
An atrial fibrillation notification
popped up.

78
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,616
Holy cow.

79
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:43,450
Holy moly.

80
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:44,985
I looked down at my Apple Watch,

81
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:47,621
and my heart rate was
187 beats per minute.

82
00:04:47,654 --> 00:04:50,190
I drove him to the hospital
where he was treated for a heart condition

83
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:51,792
he wasn't aware he had.

84
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,329
Dear, Apple,

85
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:58,165
my dad was flying our small plane
to Vermont.

86
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,400
I was asleep in the backseat.

87
00:05:00,434 --> 00:05:04,037
I woke up when we were crashing
into the tops of the trees.

88
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:06,540
The plane broke into six pieces,

89
00:05:06,573 --> 00:05:10,244
and we were miles away from civilization
in the freezing cold.

90
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,712
Then, all of a sudden,

91
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:14,348
my Apple Watch started ringing.

92
00:05:14,381 --> 00:05:16,216
I forgot I was wearing it.

93
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,552
I told my grandma
that I'd have to call her back,

94
00:05:18,585 --> 00:05:20,320
and I immediately called 911.

95
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,788
I whispered to my co-teacher,

96
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,924
"I need to go to the emergency room
right now."

97
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:26,393
We were advised to head directly
to the emergency room.

98
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,997
I held down the button and whispered,
"Siri, call 911."

99
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,767
I dialed 911,
and that sucker started ringing,

100
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,003
and I was smiling like a brand-new baby.

101
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:37,738
Rescuers arrived in minutes.

102
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:41,542
If I hadn't had the Apple Watch,
things could have been much worse.

103
00:05:41,575 --> 00:05:43,443
I'm so grateful.

104
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:46,847
From now on,
I'll never leave the house without it.

105
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:53,587
My doctor said, "It was your watch
that saved your life."

106
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,389
Thanks for helping save my friend's life.

107
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:57,958
Since the heart event was without
other symptoms,

108
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,994
clearly,
the watch was my only call to action

109
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,565
and my only link to the fine medical care
that saved my life.

00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:59,366
you can now receive a retrospective
estimate of when you ovulated.

176
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,503
Series 8 has a unique two-sensor design.

177
00:10:02,536 --> 00:10:05,806
There's one temperature sensor
on the back crystal, near your skin,

178
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,209
and another just under the display.

179
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,346
This design improves accuracy
by reducing bias

180
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,381
from the outside environment.

181
00:10:14,414 --> 00:10:17,150
Nighttime wrist temperature
can be a good indicator

182
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,353
of overall body temperature

183
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,922
because while you sleep,
your blood vessels dilate,

184
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,191
increasing blood flow to your limbs.

185
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:29,029
Overnight, Series 8 samples
your wrist temperature every 5 seconds

186
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:33,967
and it can detect changes
as small as 0.1° Celsius.

187
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,202
In the Health app,

188
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:38,505
you'll be able to see nightly shifts
from your baseline temperature,

189
00:10:38,539 --> 00:10:41,742
which can be caused
by things like exercise, jet lag,

190
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:44,311
alcohol, or illness.

191
00:10:44,344 --> 00:10:48,448
But tracking temperature changes
is even more useful for those who ovulate,

192
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,785
because cyclical patterns can reveal
the biphasic shift.

193
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:56,356
The biphasic shift is an increase in
body temperature that occurs in response

194
00:10:56,390 --> 00:11:00,661
to changing hormones,
and it can indicate ovulation.

195
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,900
If you're trying to conceive,
knowing if and when you ovulated

196
00:11:06,934 --> 00:11:08,468
can inform your family planning

197
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:11,238
and conversations
with your health care provider.

198
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:14,274
Today, the most common way
to track the biphasic shift

199
00:11:14,308 --> 00:11:17,411
is manually with a thermometer
and a journal.

200
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:20,480
Series 8 makes this much easier
and more convenient

201
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:24,985
by providing new, automatic
retrospective ovulation estimates.

202
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:27,087
Further advancing Cycle Tracking,

203
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,292
all users on iOS 16 and watchOS 9
can be now notified

204
00:11:32,326 --> 00:11:36,396
of possible cycle deviations
based on logged cycle data.

205
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:40,367
You may not realize that common
cycle deviations, like persistent spotting

206
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:44,805
or prolonged periods, can be symptoms
of serious health conditions

207
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:48,408
like fibroids, thyroid disorders, or PCOS.

208
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:51,812
That's why it's so important
to know when they occur.

209
00:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,148
The temperature sensing capability
on Series 8, plus heart rate,

210
00:11:55,182 --> 00:12:00,153
and logged cycle data come together
to give you a detailed view of your cycle,

211
00:12:00,187 --> 00:12:03,457
all of which can be easily shared
with your healthcare provider

212
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,593
to facilitate more informed conversations.

213
00:12:06,627 --> 00:12:09,930
We believe privacy
is a fundamental human right

214
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:13,800
and that your health data
is yours and yours alone.

215
00:12:13,834 --> 00:12:17,037
Your Cycle Tracking data is encrypted
on your device

216
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,141
and only accessible with your passcode,
Touch ID, or Face ID.

217
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:26,480
When using iOS and watchOS
with the default two-factor authentication

218
00:12:26,513 --> 00:12:27,681
and a passcode,

219
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:32,019
Health app data synced to iCloud
is encrypted end-to-end,

220
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:35,422
meaning that Apple does not have the key
to decrypt the data

221
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,824
and therefore cannot read it.

222
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:41,728
Only with your explicit permission
can your health data be shared.

223
00:12:41,762 --> 00:12:45,766
And you have granular control
over the types of data you share

224
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,935
and who you share it with.

225
00:12:47,968 --> 00:12:50,170
Women's health is critically important,

226
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:53,907
and we're proud to bring these new
advanced cycle tracking capabilities

227
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:56,076
to Apple Watch Series 8.

228
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:58,011
Now back to Deidre.

229
00:12:58,745 --> 00:13:00,614
Deidre: Safety features on Apple Watch,

230
00:13:00,647 --> 00:13:04,952
like fall detection and emergency SOS,
have helped save lives.

231
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:08,956
There's another emergency situation
you never want to find yourself in,

232
00:13:08,989 --> 00:13:11,024
and that's a car crash.

233
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:13,760
According to the US Department
of Transportation,

234
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:17,764
almost half of the worst crashes
occur in rural areas,

235
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:20,534
and the majority involve
only a single vehicle.

236
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:26,073
So we built an innovative new feature
to help in situations like this.

237
00:13:26,106 --> 00:13:28,742
Introducing Crash Detection.

238
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:33,881
Apple Watch Series 8 can detect
if you were in a severe car crash.

239
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:37,017
When a crash is detected,
it will automatically connect you

240
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:38,619
with emergency services,

241
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:43,257
provide your location,
and notify your emergency contacts.

242
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:45,792
And to tell you more, here's Ron.

243
00:13:45,826 --> 00:13:50,931
♪ ♪

244
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:54,368
Ron Huang: In order to detect
the unique forces of a car crash,

245
00:13:54,401 --> 00:13:57,204
we developed two new motion sensors
for Series 8:

246
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,740
an improved 3-axis gyroscope

247
00:13:59,773 --> 00:14:02,342
and a high-g-force accelerometer.

248
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:07,114
The new accelerometer is capable
of measuring up to 256 g's,

249
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:10,918
allowing it to detect
the extreme impacts of a crash.

250
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:15,556
And it samples motion four times faster–
at over 3,000 times a second–

251
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:19,126
so it can sense
the precise moment of impact.

252
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,827
With these new technologies,

253
00:14:20,861 --> 00:14:23,630
we built an advanced
sensor fusion algorithm

254
00:14:23,664 --> 00:14:25,766
to deliver accurate Crash Detection.

255
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:29,303
We started by spending years
studying vehicle impacts

256
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,905
at state-of-the-art crash test labs.

257
00:14:31,939 --> 00:14:34,875
We focused on four main types
of severe crashes:

258
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:38,011
front impact, side impact,

259
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:40,914
rear-end collision, and rollovers.

260
00:14:40,948 --> 00:14:44,484
In each crash test, we captured data
from the new gyroscope

261
00:14:44,518 --> 00:14:48,222
and accelerometer
as well as from other sensors in Series 8

262
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:52,993
including the barometer,
microphone, and GPS.

263
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:57,197
And then we used machine learning
to incorporate all of these signals

264
00:14:57,231 --> 00:14:58,599
into the algorithm,

265
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:01,735
which was trained on over 1 million hours

266
00:15:01,768 --> 00:15:04,271
of real-world driving and crash data.

267
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:07,975
Series 8 can detect crashes
in the most popular types of vehicles

268
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:12,246
like passenger cars,
SUVs, and pickup trucks.

269
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,748
Crash Detection runs only
when you're driving

270
00:15:14,781 --> 00:15:18,519
and processes data only
around the time of a possible crash,

271
00:15:18,552 --> 00:15:21,388
entirely on your device.

272
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,791
That's Crash Detection
on Apple Watch Series 8.

273
00:15:24,825 --> 00:15:26,493
We truly hope you never need it,

274
00:15:26,527 --> 00:15:30,130
but that you will feel a little bit safer
every time you get in the car.

275
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:31,598
Now, back to Deidre.

276
00:15:34,768 --> 00:15:39,206
Deidre: Even with the new temperature and
motion sensors working in the background,

277
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:44,411
Apple Watch Series 8 still has all-day,
18-hour battery life.

278
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,847
But sometimes,
like if you're on a long flight

279
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,682
or without a charger for the night,

280
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:51,051
you need to preserve battery life.

281
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:54,755
To help with that,
we're introducing Low Power Mode,

282
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:59,159
which can give you up to 36 hours
of battery life on a full charge.

283
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:03,964
Low Power Mode maintains many
of the core features of Apple Watch–

284
00:16:03,997 --> 00:16:06,567
like activity tracking
and fall detection–

285
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,570
while temporarily disabling
other features,

286
00:16:09,603 --> 00:16:13,173
like Always-On display
and auto workout detection,

287
00:16:13,207 --> 00:16:18,212
providing maximum battery savings with
the least impact to the user experience.

288
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,685
Low Power Mode is available on Series 4
and later running watchOS 9.

289
00:16:24,718 --> 00:16:29,456
Cellular models of Series 8
will also support international roaming.

290
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:34,027
Apple Watch will now be able
to stay connected to your cellular network

291
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:35,863
while you're traveling abroad.

292
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:41,268
Simply add your Apple Watch to your iPhone
roaming plan at little or no cost.

293
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:44,905
By the end of the year,
international roaming will be available

294
00:16:44,938 --> 00:16:47,875
on more than 30 carriers worldwide.

295
00:16:47,908 --> 00:16:51,445
It will be supported on all
cellular models of Apple Watch

296
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:55,415
from Series 5 onward running watchOS 9.

297
00:16:55,449 --> 00:17:01,388
Apple Watch Series 8 will be available
in four colors of 100% recycled aluminum:

298
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,357
Midnight, Starlight,

299
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,726
Silver, and Product(RED),

300
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,198
and in three stainless steel finishes:
Silver, Gold, and Graphite.

301
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:16,470
There are also great new colors
across our most popular band styles.

302
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:20,140
We also have exciting updates
to both Nike bands,

303
00:17:20,174 --> 00:17:23,210
including fresh colors
for the Nike Sport Band

304
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:26,980
and a new Nike Sport Loop
"Just Do It" woven

305
00:17:27,014 --> 00:17:28,582
right into the textile.

306
00:17:28,615 --> 00:17:30,184
And with watchOS 9,

307
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,486
you can use all Nike watch faces

308
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:34,855
with any Apple Watch.

309
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,992
There are also two stylish new bands
for Apple Watch Hermès.

310
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:42,362
"H Diagonal" uses hundreds
of micro-perforations

311
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:46,967
to create a sporty pattern
of the iconic Hermès H.

312
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,337
And "Gourmette Metal"
features a polished silver chain

313
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,041
wrapping twice around the wrist
for a bold look.

314
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:57,077
There's also a new
"Hermès Lucky Horse" watch face

315
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,314
that celebrates their equestrian roots.

316
00:18:00,347 --> 00:18:03,851
That's the incredible
new Apple Watch Series 8

317
00:18:03,884 --> 00:18:07,955
with temperature sensing,
retrospective ovulation estimates,

318
00:18:07,988 --> 00:18:11,058
Crash Detection,
and international roaming,

319
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:13,660
on top of best-in-class health features

320
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:17,598
like Blood Oxygen,
ECG, and sleep tracking.

321
00:18:17,631 --> 00:18:22,402
It has the latest design that users love
with an edge-to-edge display,

322
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:25,405
great durability, and fast charging,

323
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,176
and all the new features of watchOS 9.

324
00:18:29,209 --> 00:18:32,846
Apple Watch Series 8 will start
at $399 for GPS

325
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,148
and $499 for cellular.

326
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:38,452
And with the purchase
of any new Apple Watch,

327
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:42,055
you'll also get 3 months of Fitness+ free.

328
00:18:42,089 --> 00:18:46,760
You can order today,
and it will be available September 16th.

329
00:18:46,793 --> 00:18:48,962
And that's Apple Watch Series 8.

330
00:18:48,996 --> 00:18:50,097
Now back to Jeff.

331
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,936
Jeff:
I am so incredibly excited about Series 8.

332
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:59,206
Let's take one more look
at this amazing watch.

333
00:19:00,374 --> 00:19:02,309
So you've taken up running.

334
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,045
Apple Watch has taken up
a few new things as well.

335
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:09,850
First, it tracked your distance.
Now, it's tracking your stride length.

336
00:19:09,883 --> 00:19:13,820
It learns your favorite route,
then lets you race against yourself.

337
00:19:13,854 --> 00:19:14,721
You're behind.

338
00:19:14,755 --> 00:19:16,823
Yeah, you're behind.

339
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:19,826
When you're swimming,

340
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,261
it can tell a breaststroke

341
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:22,763
from a backstroke

342
00:19:22,796 --> 00:19:24,364
from a kickboard.

343
00:19:24,398 --> 00:19:25,766
And when you're done,

344
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,534
it dries itself off.

345
00:19:29,803 --> 00:19:34,041
This isn't a dream.
Your watch can take an ECG.

346
00:19:34,074 --> 00:19:35,943
But if it was a dream,

347
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:40,547
that watch would track your REM sleep
down to the minute.

348
00:19:40,581 --> 00:19:42,883
It checks your heart rate.

349
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,854
It checks for temperature changes
to estimate when you've ovulated.

350
00:19:46,887 --> 00:19:50,090
It checks out
when you're buying spaghetti.

351
00:19:50,123 --> 00:19:53,493
It could already detect if you fell.

352
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:55,462
Now the microphone detects
impact noise,

353
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:57,598
the accelerometer senses
rapid deceleration,

354
00:19:57,631 --> 00:19:59,833
and the barometer measures
a shift in pressure

355
00:19:59,867 --> 00:20:02,669
consistent with an air bag going off.

356
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:07,341
So it can check if you need help
after a car crash.

357
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:11,345
And hey, it also shows
your ground contact time.

358
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:13,146
Amazing.

359
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,982
Have a nice run.

360
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:21,788
Jeff:
Next, let's talk about Apple Watch SE.

361
00:20:21,822 --> 00:20:23,757
SE has been a huge hit,

362
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,393
and for more than 80% of SE customers

363
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,762
it's their very first Apple Watch.

364
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:32,766
They love how SE delivers
the core Apple Watch experience

365
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,902
at a more affordable price.

366
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:39,506
SE is a fantastic way
to get started with Apple Watch.

367
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,910
And this year, it gets even better.

368
00:20:42,943 --> 00:20:47,414
The new SE will be available
in Silver, Midnight, and Starlight–

369
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:50,517
all in 100% recycled aluminum.

370
00:20:50,551 --> 00:20:53,420
And we've completely redesigned
the back case.

371
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:56,056
It's now made of nylon
composite materials

372
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:59,660
that match perfectly
with the three case finishes.

373
00:20:59,693 --> 00:21:03,063
And there's a new production process
that reduces its carbon footprint

374
00:21:03,096 --> 00:21:05,432
by over 80%.

375
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:08,635
Now, back to Deidre to tell you more.

376
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:14,241
Deidre: The second generation SE
continues to deliver the core benefits

377
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,610
of Apple Watch that users love,

378
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:19,813
like workout and activity tracking.

379
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:21,915
It's swim-proof.

380
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:24,885
It has high and low heart rate
notifications,

381
00:21:24,918 --> 00:21:27,254
emergency SOS,

382
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:29,756
and fall detection.

383
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:33,794
SE also includes the same motion sensors
as Series 8

384
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:36,129
to support Crash Detection.

385
00:21:36,163 --> 00:21:38,765
And with AirPods, you can listen
to your music anywhere.

386
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:44,304
The SE display is 30% larger
than that of Series 3.

387
00:21:44,338 --> 00:21:49,576
And SE features the same
S8 System in Package that's in Series 8,

388
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:53,680
making it up to 20% faster than before.

389
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:58,151
SE continues to be the perfect Apple Watch
for Family Setup.

390
00:21:58,185 --> 00:22:02,589
With Family Setup, you can use your iPhone
to pair watches for your children

391
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:05,259
who don't yet have their own iPhones.

392
00:22:05,292 --> 00:22:09,696
Kids can make phone calls and send
messages to contacts that you specify,

393
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,268
connect to emergency services,
and share their location.

394
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:18,505
And with new features coming soon
like the Home app and home keys in Wallet,

395
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:22,309
Family Setup allows even more independence
for kids

396
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:24,378
and more peace of mind for parents.

397
00:22:24,411 --> 00:22:27,848
SE offers everyone
the core features of Apple Watch,

398
00:22:27,881 --> 00:22:30,751
and now includes the faster S8 SiP,

399
00:22:30,784 --> 00:22:34,855
Crash Detection,
new case colors with matching back cases,

400
00:22:34,888 --> 00:22:38,692
and all the new capabilities of watchOS 9,

401
00:22:38,725 --> 00:22:43,163
all at a more affordable price
starting at $249 for GPS

402
00:22:43,197 --> 00:22:45,566
and $299 for cellular.

403
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:49,369
You can order it today and it will
be available on September 16th.

404
00:22:50,304 --> 00:22:54,007

protecting it from edge impacts

We also added a new button–
the Action button–

451
00:25:50,384 --> 00:25:53,287
in high-contrast "international orange".

452

00:27:35,289 --> 00:27:39,326
With explorers in mind,
we developed the Alpine Loop.

483
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:44,831
The titanium G-hook securely fastens
through the reinforced top loops.

484

00:29:21,795 --> 00:29:23,897
that, in addition to L1,

516
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:27,134
also includes the latest frequency: L5,

517
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,070
plus new, custom positioning algorithms.

518
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:32,406
In dense urban conditions like this,

519
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,709
Apple Watch Ultra provides
the most accurate GPS

520
00:29:35,742 --> 00:29:37,644
of any sport watch in the market.

521
00:29:37,678 --> 00:29:40,914
We also brought some great workout updates
to watchOS 9

522
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:43,183
inspired by high-performance athletes,

523
00:29:43,217 --> 00:29:46,286
with new metrics,
views, and experiences

524
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:50,357
like vertical oscillation,
heart rate zones, and custom workouts.

525
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:53,927
And now, with the addition
of the Action button on Apple Watch Ultra,

526
00:29:53,961 --> 00:29:58,532
you can make the workout experience
more powerful and more precise.

527
00:29:58,565 --> 00:29:59,800
Press the Action button

528
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,902
for the most accurate start
to your workout.

529
00:30:02,336 --> 00:30:06,406
For triathletes and duathletes, the Action
button lets you instantly transition

530
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,942
from one leg of your race to the next.

531
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:11,812
And later this year,
we're enabling a new feature

532
00:30:11,845 --> 00:30:15,249
which automatically detects
when you arrive at a running track,

533
00:30:15,282 --> 00:30:17,818
ensuring the most accurate pace
and distance.

534
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:20,754
The Action button lets you
conveniently mark a segment

535
00:30:20,787 --> 00:30:24,291
with a single press
for the ultimate track-running experience.

536
00:30:24,324 --> 00:30:28,362
For endurance athletes, the bigger
battery makes a big difference.

537
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:32,533
Of course, you can easily complete
a marathon with battery life to spare.

538
00:30:32,566 --> 00:30:35,035
Using the new low-power workout setting,

539
00:30:35,068 --> 00:30:40,474
most athletes can do a 2.4-mile swim,
plus a 112-mile bike ride,

540
00:30:40,507 --> 00:30:41,942
and then run a marathon

541
00:30:41,975 --> 00:30:46,513
to complete a long-distance triathlon
with full precision GPS and heart rate.

542
00:30:46,547 --> 00:30:48,782
But Ultra is so much more.

543
00:30:48,815 --> 00:30:53,520
It's designed to help you explore
the most extreme and remote locations,

544
00:30:53,554 --> 00:30:56,523
from freezing-cold mountains
at minutes 20° Celsius

545
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:59,760
to the blazing desert heat
at 55° Celsius,

546
00:30:59,793 --> 00:31:02,262
or 130° Fahrenheit.

547
00:31:02,296 --> 00:31:06,500
When navigating in the backcountry,
a compass is an essential tool.

548
00:31:06,533 --> 00:31:08,869
So we completely redesigned
the Compass app

549
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:12,139
with new precision views
and added capabilities.

550
00:31:12,172 --> 00:31:15,976
The orienteering view includes
Compass Waypoints to mark a position–

551
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,012
like the location of the trailhead
or your tent–

552
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,782
and they can be quickly added
using the Action button.

553
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:25,018
And if you get lost or disoriented,

554
00:31:25,052 --> 00:31:28,488
Backtrack uses GPS data
to create a path of where you've been,

555
00:31:28,522 --> 00:31:30,557
so you can easily retrace your steps.

556
00:31:31,491 --> 00:31:34,995
And it turns on automatically in the
background when you go off the grid,

557
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:36,296
just in case.

558
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,199
Getting help when you need it is critical,

559
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:41,435
especially in the backcountry.

560
00:31:41,468 --> 00:31:45,539
That's why Apple Watch Ultra has
a built-in 86 decibel siren

561
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,075
that you can activate
using the Action button.

562
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:52,980
It has a unique sound pattern
that alerts others to your location

563
00:31:53,013 --> 00:31:56,183
up to 600 feet, or 180 meters, away.

564
00:31:57,618 --> 00:32:02,155
Finally, Apple Watch Ultra
has been designed for water sports.

565
00:32:02,189 --> 00:32:05,092
It can withstand the intense
dynamic forces of activities

566
00:32:05,125 --> 00:32:07,027
like kitesurfing and wakeboarding,

567
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:08,829
and it can go deep below the waves

568
00:32:08,862 --> 00:32:13,400
because we engineered it
to twice the water resistance, WR100.

569
00:32:13,433 --> 00:32:17,037
Using its new built-in depth gauge,
Ultra automatically launches

570
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:19,106
a new Depth app when submerged

571
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:23,243
to show current depth, underwater time,
and water temperature.

572
00:32:23,277 --> 00:32:27,147
We also want Ultra to be a great tool
for recreational scuba divers.

573
00:32:27,181 --> 00:32:31,218
So it's been certified to EN 13319,

574
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:35,155
the internationally recognized standard
for dive computers and gauges.

575
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:37,157
And we're partnering
with Huish Outdoors

576
00:32:37,191 --> 00:32:40,160
to create an exclusive app
that turns Apple Watch Ultra

577
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:43,597
into a capable dive computer
for recreational scuba diving

578
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,700
to the depth of 40 meters, or 130 feet.

579
00:32:46,733 --> 00:32:49,203
To tell you more
about this incredible app,

580
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:52,639
here's Mike Huish, CEO of Huish Outdoors.

Mike Huish: Our company is world-renowned

583
00:33:11,158 --> 00:33:14,328
for powering every aspect
of the underwater experience.

584
00:33:14,361 --> 00:33:18,599
And Oceanic has been a leading innovator
in scuba diving for over 50 years,

585
00:33:18,632 --> 00:33:21,568
introducing
some of the very first dive computers.

586
00:33:21,602 --> 00:33:27,174
We're thrilled to announce our new
Oceanic+ app for Apple Watch Ultra.

587
00:33:27,207 --> 00:33:30,744
This is so exciting for anyone
interested in scuba diving

588
00:33:30,777 --> 00:33:35,148
because now the same watch you wear
every day is also your dive computer.

589
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:38,585
We've designed Oceanic+
with all the key features

590
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:41,421
for recreational scuba divers
and free divers.

591
00:33:41,455 --> 00:33:45,392
And it works seamlessly
with our iPhone app to plan your dives.

592
00:33:45,425 --> 00:33:48,061
Our dive planner
calculates depth and time,

593
00:33:48,095 --> 00:33:50,864
and integrates dive conditions like tides,

594
00:33:50,898 --> 00:33:54,768
water temperature, and even up-to-date
information from the community,

595
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:56,970
like visibility and currents.

596
00:33:57,004 --> 00:34:00,140
The best way to experience this
is on a real dive,

597
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:01,542
so let's get in the water.

598
00:34:01,575 --> 00:34:05,145
Your dive metrics
are all simple and easy to read

599
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:07,181
on the large, bright display.

600
00:34:07,214 --> 00:34:09,917
Our app runs
the Bühlmann decompression algorithm,

601
00:34:09,950 --> 00:34:13,787
which constantly calculates
and monitors dive parameters.

602
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,656
So from the moment you start a dive,

603
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:19,293
all critical information
is just a glance away.

604
00:34:19,326 --> 00:34:23,030
And unlike most dive computers,
which require you to perform

605
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:27,134
a complex sequence of button presses
to find the information you need,

606
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,802
our app uses simple gestures.

607
00:34:29,469 --> 00:34:33,140
Rotate the Digital Crown
to access additional screens

608
00:34:33,173 --> 00:34:36,076
or press the Action button
to set a compass heading.

609
00:34:36,777 --> 00:34:40,480
Oceanic+ provides all of
the safety warnings that you would expect

610
00:34:40,514 --> 00:34:42,983
from the most advanced
dive computers today,

611
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:46,720
like decompression limits,
excessive ascent rate,

612
00:34:46,753 --> 00:34:49,957
and at the end of your dive,
safety stop guidance

613
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:53,260
all smartly color-coded
to help make complex information

614
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:54,995
easy to understand.

615
00:34:55,028 --> 00:34:59,900
Right after the dive, your data–including
your GPS entry and exit location–

616
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:03,270
automatically syncs to your iPhone
and the cloud,

617
00:35:03,303 --> 00:35:05,939
where you can see
a summary of your dive profile.

618
00:35:05,973 --> 00:35:09,710
And in your logbook,
you can sort and search past dives,

619
00:35:09,743 --> 00:35:12,679
and instantly share your adventures
with family and friends,

And Apple Watch Ultra,
as well as our entire watch lineup,

637
00:36:05,265 --> 00:36:08,135
was designed with the environment
in mind–

638
00:36:08,168 --> 00:36:10,304
from the use of recycled materials

654
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,835
Ultra's design pushes the boundaries

655
00:37:14,868 --> 00:37:17,004
so you can do the same.

656
00:37:17,037 --> 00:37:20,407
The rugged, yet lightweight, titanium case
extends

657

or climb 130° above it.

660
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:35,989
Into the unknown,
you'll want the battery to last for days.

661
00:37:36,023 --> 00:37:38,258
That's why Ultra was built
with a larger battery

662
00:37:38,292 --> 00:37:41,361
for multi-day use on a single charge.

663
00:37:42,896 --> 00:37:44,932
You'll also need a map.

664
00:37:44,965 --> 00:37:47,167
Or better yet, a dual-frequency GPS

665
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:49,903
with pinpoint accuracy.

666
00:37:49,937 --> 00:37:51,939
The Compass has been redesigned

667
00:37:51,972 --> 00:37:54,641

A turn of the Crown engages Night mode,

671
00:38:04,084 --> 00:38:06,353
which removes retina-altering blue light

672
00:38:06,386 --> 00:38:10,490
to ease the strain on your eyes
in the dark.

Beside the bigger, brighter screen

674
00:38:12,593 --> 00:38:14,828

a customizable Action button.

676
00:38:18,465 --> 00:38:21,902
One push lets you track race segments,

which is now strapped to your arm,

680
00:38:29,443 --> 00:38:33,180
tracking everything from depth
to water temperature.

681
00:38:33,213 --> 00:38:36,350
The micro-polished sapphire surface
and sealed case

682
00:38:36,383 --> 00:38:39,019
result in an Apple Watch twice
as water resistant

683
00:38:39,052 --> 00:38:42,890
as any Apple Watch to come before it.

684
00:38:42,923 --> 00:38:46,193
And the audio system's three microphones

1027
01:00:54,955 --> 01:00:58,725
Today, we are announcing
a groundbreaking new service for iPhone:

1028
01:00:58,759 --> 01:01:02,196
Emergency SOS via satellite.

1029
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:06,266
While iPhone is designed
for a best-in-class cellular experience,

1030
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:10,671
connecting to a satellite presents
an entirely new set of challenges.

1031
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:14,341
Smartphones connect to cell towers
that are a few miles away.

1032
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:15,843
Over the last several decades,

1033
01:01:15,876 --> 01:01:18,345
carriers have built
more and more cell towers

1034
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:21,849
to improve the strength and speed
of their network service.

1035
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:26,353
However, there are some places–
like winding back roads

1036
01:01:26,386 --> 01:01:29,189
and mountain ridges–
that cell towers don't reach.

1037
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:35,329
Connectivity in these areas can
be provided by communication satellites.

1038
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,431
Unlike stationary cell towers,

1039
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:40,834
communication satellites
are hundreds of miles above the Earth,

1040
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:44,638
and flying at over 15,000 miles per hour.

1041
01:01:45,072 --> 01:01:48,008
To connect to these satellites,
you need to be outside,

1042
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,210
with a clear view of the sky.

1043
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:54,014
And the bandwidth is so limited
that even sending a text message

1044
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,949
is a technical challenge.

1045
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:58,552
Typically, the only way to tap
into such a network

1046
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:02,689
is with an expensive device
that uses a bulky external antenna.

1047
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:06,093
We knew that approach
just wouldn't work for iPhone.

1048
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:08,595
So we invented another way.

1049
01:02:08,629 --> 01:02:13,100
We designed and built custom components
and specific software

1050
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:17,604
so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect
to satellites' unique frequencies.

1051
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:21,542
That connection is only possible
when the phone is pointing

1052
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,544
directly at a satellite.

1053
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:27,681
However, satellites fly too high
to be seen by the human eye.

1054
01:02:27,714 --> 01:02:32,719
So we created a unique user experience
that shows you where to point your phone

1055
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:37,191
to establish a connection,
and stay connected as the satellite moves.

1056
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:40,694
This way, no bulky antenna is needed.

1057
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,198
Once connected,
you need to send and receive

1058
01:02:44,231 --> 01:02:47,034
enough information to get emergency help.

1059
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:50,204
Standard messaging protocols
are not designed

1060
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:52,206
for a satellite's limited bandwidth.

1061
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,976
So we created a custom
short text compression algorithm

1062
01:02:56,009 --> 01:02:59,813
to reduce the average size of messages
by a factor of three.

1063
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:03,250
Thanks to this algorithm,
it can take less than 15 seconds

1064
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:06,687
to send a message
if you have a clear view of the sky.

1065
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,189
In other conditions,
such as light foliage,

1066
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:11,158
it may take a few minutes.

1067
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,927
And since each message can take some time,

1068
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,163
we knew a standard back-and-forth
conversation

1069
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,366
would take far too long
for an emergency situation.

1070
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:22,503
We worked with emergency experts
to surface the questions

1071
01:03:22,536 --> 01:03:24,571
they're most likely to ask,

1072
01:03:24,605 --> 01:03:26,507
and we provided the most common responses

1073
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,576
for you to choose from
with just a few taps.

1074
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,945
With fewer messages to write and send,

1075
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:34,414
you can get help quicker.

1076
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:36,817
After your message
is relayed to a ground station,

1077
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:40,053
it needs to reach
the right emergency service provider.

1078
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:43,290
If that emergency service provider
accepts text messages,

1079
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:45,692
we will connect you to them directly.

1080
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:49,763
If they only accept voice calls,
we have set up Relay Centers,

1081
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:52,466
staffed with highly-trained
emergency specialists

1082
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:57,271
ready to get your text and call an
emergency service provider on your behalf.

1083
01:03:57,304 --> 01:04:00,107
It took years
to make this vision a reality

1084
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,811
through game-changing hardware, software,
and infrastructure innovation.

1085
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:07,848
This breakthrough service can also be used

1086
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:10,951
in more casual, less dire circumstances.

1087
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:13,987
So if you're out on a long hike,
you can use the Find My app

1088
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:17,524
to share your location manually
via satellite.

1089
01:04:17,558 --> 01:04:19,960
This lets your loved ones know
where you are,

1090
01:04:19,993 --> 01:04:22,496
without you even sending a message.

1091
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,498
Now, back to Kaiann.

1092
01:04:25,766 --> 01:04:27,267
Kaiann: We believe that this service

1093
01:04:27,301 --> 01:04:30,270
is such an essential part
of the iPhone experience

1094
01:04:30,304 --> 01:04:33,807
that we'll include it free for two years
with iPhone 14.

1095
01:04:34,808 --> 01:04:39,179
It launches in November,
and we're starting with the US and Canada.

1096
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:41,949
Now, let's talk about the environment.

1097
01:04:41,982 --> 01:04:47,120
Since 2020, Apple's corporate operations
have been carbon neutral.

1098
01:04:47,154 --> 01:04:50,858
To reach our goal
of carbon neutral products by 2030,

1099
01:04:50,891 --> 01:04:54,628
we're looking at our environmental impact
across our supply chain

1100
01:04:54,661 --> 01:04:56,797
and the entire product lifecycle.

1101
01:04:57,397 --> 01:05:00,234
Over 200 of our suppliers have committed

1102
01:05:00,267 --> 01:05:04,037
to 100% renewable energy
for Apple production.

1103
01:05:04,071 --> 01:05:09,276
Our suppliers work to create less waste
and then reuse, recycle, or compost.

1104
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:12,513
In fiscal year 2021 alone,

1105
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:17,551
iPhone suppliers kept
over 250,000 metric tons of waste

1106
01:05:17,584 --> 01:05:19,686
from ending up in a landfill–

1107
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:22,322
that's about one year's worth of waste

1108
01:05:22,356 --> 01:05:25,492
from 730,000 households.

1109
01:05:25,526 --> 01:05:28,128
We build our products to last.

1110
01:05:28,161 --> 01:05:34,067
This durability enabled millions of
trade-ins to find new owners in 2021.

1111
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:37,004
And when it is time to recycle an iPhone,

1112
01:05:37,037 --> 01:05:39,773
that has environmental benefits too.

1113
01:05:39,806 --> 01:05:44,545
In fact, one metric ton of recovered
main logic boards and cameras

1114
01:05:44,578 --> 01:05:50,584
has the same amount of gold and copper
as over 2,000 metric tons of mined rock.

1115
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:54,821
So don't throw away your old iPhone
or leave it sitting in a drawer–

1116
01:05:54,855 --> 01:05:57,491
bring it to your nearest store
or mail it in.

1117
01:05:57,524 --> 01:06:02,229
Together, we can reduce our impact
on the planet one step at a time.

1118
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:04,398
And that's iPhone 14,

1119
01:06:04,431 --> 01:06:07,434
with powerful new cameras,
Photonic Engine,

1120
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:11,638
Action mode,
A15 Bionic with a 5-core GPU,

1121
01:06:11,672 --> 01:06:15,509
Emergency SOS via satellite,
Crash Detection,

1122
01:06:15,542 --> 01:06:20,280

with the best battery life in an iPhone,

1123
01:06:20,314 --> 01:06:22,382
and so much more.

1124
01:06:22,416 --> 01:06:27,654
And later this fall, Apple Fitness+
will be available to all iPhone users,

1125
01:06:27,688 --> 01:06:30,290
even if they don't yet have
an Apple Watch.

1126
01:06:30,324 --> 01:06:33,894
iPhone 14 will start at just $799.

1127
01:06:33,927 --> 01:06:37,531
This is the same starting price
as last year's iPhone 13,

1128
01:06:37,564 --> 01:06:41,635
but with so much more capability
that sets a new standard for iPhone.

1129
01:06:42,736 --> 01:06:46,240
And iPhone 14 Plus starts at just $899,

1130
01:06:46,273 --> 01:06:48,976
bringing the larger 6.7" display

1131
01:06:49,009 --> 01:06:52,346
and the best battery life
to more people than ever.

1132

01:10:57,424 --> 01:11:00,060
It starts with the new TrueDepth camera.

1172
01:11:00,093 --> 01:11:03,263
We redesigned all components
to fit into a smaller size,

1173
01:11:03,297 --> 01:11:05,432
using 30% less area.

1174
01:11:05,465 --> 01:11:08,936
We put the proximity sensor
behind the display for the first time.

1175
01:11:08,969 --> 01:11:13,473
With this change, we reconsidered
how you interact with your iPhone.

1176
01:11:13,507 --> 01:11:15,742
Throughout the day,
you experience different types

1177
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:17,845
of alerts and notifications,

1178
01:11:17,878 --> 01:11:20,047
and these are often happening
while you're doing other things

1179
01:11:20,080 --> 01:11:21,281
on your iPhone.

1180
01:11:21,315 --> 01:11:24,384
So we developed a new experience
that's even better.

1181
01:11:24,418 --> 01:11:26,320
Here's Alan to tell you more.

1182
01:11:29,323 --> 01:11:30,858
Alan Dye: Our goal was to design a space

1183
01:11:30,891 --> 01:11:35,362
that clearly and consistently
surfaces alerts and background activity

1184
01:11:35,395 --> 01:11:37,297
in a rich and delightful way,

1185
01:11:37,331 --> 01:11:41,635
the result being an entirely new
and intuitive way to interact with iPhone,

1186
01:11:41,668 --> 01:11:45,105
one that truly blurs the line
between hardware and software.

1187
01:11:45,138 --> 01:11:48,442
We're calling it the Dynamic Island.

1188
01:11:48,475 --> 01:11:51,745
We've designed this new space
to be highly adaptive

1189
01:11:51,778 --> 01:11:54,581
so it can fluidly expand
into different shapes

1190

So now, when you receive an alert,

1192
01:12:00,854 --> 01:12:03,423
the Dynamic Island expands to notify you.

1193
01:12:03,457 --> 01:12:06,593
Our ambition is to clearly convey
the information

1194
01:12:06,627 --> 01:12:08,829
and present content and controls

1195
01:12:08,862 --> 01:12:11,331
without distracting from the app
you're in.

1196
01:12:11,365 --> 01:12:13,133
This works across the entire system

1197
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:15,569
for things like
confirming your AirPods are connected,

1198
01:12:15,602 --> 01:12:18,839
muting, or starting a charge.

1199
01:12:18,872 --> 01:12:21,141
Each alert has its own personality,

1200
01:12:21,175 --> 01:12:23,177
and it's been designed
with its own unique character,

1201
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:26,013
making it easy to identify at a glance,

1202
01:12:26,046 --> 01:12:27,881
like when you're using FaceID,

1203
01:12:27,915 --> 01:12:30,784
or tapping your iPhone
in transit locations.

1204
01:12:30,817 --> 01:12:34,655
The Dynamic Island also displays
ongoing background activity,

1205
01:12:34,688 --> 01:12:36,590
like when you're playing music.

1206
01:12:36,623 --> 01:12:38,225
When you swipe to go home,

1207
01:12:38,258 --> 01:12:41,361
the Music app gracefully morphs
into the Dynamic Island,

1208
01:12:41,395 --> 01:12:43,931
always staying active and visible.

1209
01:12:43,964 --> 01:12:47,201
And we've even designed it
to show the current album art.

1210
01:12:47,234 --> 01:12:49,303
It's also completely interactive.

1211
01:12:49,336 --> 01:12:52,039
You can tap and hold
to expose more options,

1212
01:12:52,072 --> 01:12:53,874
or tap to go back to the app.

1213
01:12:53,907 --> 01:12:55,742
So now, when you're on a call,

1214
01:12:55,776 --> 01:12:59,046
you have easy access to controls
without leaving the app you're using.

1215
01:12:59,980 --> 01:13:03,517
We've designed all these animations
to feel fluid, lively,

1216
01:13:03,550 --> 01:13:05,986
and highly responsive.

1217
01:13:06,019 --> 01:13:09,122
The Dynamic Island is always live
and active,

1218
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:11,391
heightening the sense of vitality

1219
01:13:11,425 --> 01:13:15,028
by adapting in real time
to show you important information,

1220
01:13:15,062 --> 01:13:17,231
like your next direction from Maps.

1221
01:13:17,264 --> 01:13:19,967
And it's always visible
for ongoing activities,

1222
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,102
like when you're using the timer.

1223
01:13:22,135 --> 01:13:25,906
We've designed Live Activities–
a new feature on the iOS 16 Lock Screen–

1224
01:13:25,939 --> 01:13:28,742
to work seamlessly
with the Dynamic Island,

1225
01:13:28,775 --> 01:13:31,345
including support for third-party apps,

1226
01:13:31,378 --> 01:13:34,882
so you can keep track of what's happening
from anywhere on iPhone,

1227
01:13:34,915 --> 01:13:38,585
like following a baseball game
without needing to leave the app you're in

1228
01:13:38,619 --> 01:13:41,722
or not missing the Lyft ride
while texting friends.

1229
01:13:41,755 --> 01:13:45,592
We've also created a robust design system
for developers,

1230
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:50,230
so every alert looks and feels consistent,
no matter which app it comes from.

1231
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:52,833
And when you have
more than one background activity,

1232
01:13:52,866 --> 01:13:55,169
the Dynamic Island playfully adapts,

1233
01:13:55,202 --> 01:13:57,638
bubbling out into two elements.

1234
01:13:57,671 --> 01:14:02,376
At Apple, we're focused on creating
extraordinary products,

1235
01:14:02,409 --> 01:14:05,746
products born from designing
hardware and software together,

1236
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:09,283
so you don't know where one ends
and the other begins.

1237
01:14:09,316 --> 01:14:12,319
The Dynamic Island does this
in a truly magical way

1238
01:14:12,352 --> 01:14:15,622
and enables
an entirely new iPhone experience.

1239
01:14:15,656 --> 01:14:17,424
Back to Joz.

1240
01:14:18,559 --> 01:14:23,530
Joz: iPhone 14 Pro has a stunning
new display with Pro features.

1241
01:14:23,564 --> 01:14:27,301
This is the most advanced display
we have ever shipped.

1242
01:14:27,334 --> 01:14:32,105
iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max
come in two great sizes,

1243
01:14:32,139 --> 01:14:35,742
now with even thinner borders,
more active area,

1244
01:14:35,776 --> 01:14:37,778
and the Dynamic Island.

1245
01:14:37,811 --> 01:14:39,046
It is also brighter.

1246
01:14:39,079 --> 01:14:44,117
The new display provides
peak HDR brightness of 1600 nits,

1247
01:14:44,151 --> 01:14:48,322
bringing iPhone to the same level
as the Pro Display XDR.

1248
01:14:48,355 --> 01:14:51,658
So photos and HDR movies
are gonna look amazing–

1249
01:14:51,692 --> 01:14:53,827
including those you shoot on your iPhone.

1250
01:14:53,861 --> 01:14:57,798
And for those bright, sunny days,
iPhone can now push brightness even higher

1251
01:14:57,831 --> 01:14:59,933
for a peak of 2000 nits.

1252
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,069
That's twice as bright as before,

1253
01:15:02,102 --> 01:15:05,973
and the highest peak brightness
of any smartphone.

1254
01:15:06,006 --> 01:15:09,843
The new Lock Screen in iOS 16
introduces more personalization

1255
01:15:09,877 --> 01:15:12,012
with widgets and Live Activities,

1256
01:15:12,045 --> 01:15:15,215
so this is the perfect time to introduce

1257
01:15:15,249 --> 01:15:17,184
Always-On display.

1258
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:20,454
It's easy to see the time
and other important information

1259
01:15:20,487 --> 01:15:23,657
without raising your iPhone
or tapping the display.

1260
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:26,660
This keeps essential information available
for the moments

1261
01:15:26,693 --> 01:15:28,762
where all you need is just a glance.

1262
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:32,299
This is made possible
by a number of new technologies

1263
01:15:32,332 --> 01:15:35,302
that make the display
incredibly power efficient.

1264
01:15:35,335 --> 01:15:38,705
This display can operate
at a refresh rate as low as 1Hz

1265
01:15:38,739 --> 01:15:40,541
with a new low power mode,

1266
01:15:40,574 --> 01:15:43,277
and we further improved
our LTPO technology,

1267
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:47,414
allowing the display to intelligently dim
the entire Lock Screen.

1268
01:15:48,982 --> 01:15:51,852
We also take advantage
of multiple coprocessors in our chip

1269
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:54,721
to refresh the display
using minimal power,

1270
01:15:54,755 --> 01:15:59,026
so the time, widgets, and Live Activities
are always available.

1271
01:15:59,059 --> 01:16:03,297
And we use our photographic expertise
and powerful image segmentation

1272
01:16:03,330 --> 01:16:06,567
to dim wallpaper photos
while preserving skin tones,

1273
01:16:06,600 --> 01:16:08,802
so they continue to look great.

1274
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:10,971
And you can keep an eye
on your Live Activities

1275
01:16:11,004 --> 01:16:13,740
without even touching your iPhone.

1276
01:16:13,774 --> 01:16:15,809
With all these incredible features,

1277
01:16:15,843 --> 01:16:19,580
the new Super Retina XDR
is the most advanced display

1278
01:16:19,613 --> 01:16:21,615
ever in a smartphone.

1279
01:16:21,648 --> 01:16:26,820
iPhone 14 Pro is powered
by our new A16 Bionic chip.

1280
01:16:26,854 --> 01:16:31,124
Our newest generation of Apple Silicon
powers every experience on iPhone.

1281
01:16:31,158 --> 01:16:34,661
With A16, we focused
on three important areas:

1282
01:16:34,695 --> 01:16:38,398
power efficiency, display, and camera.

1283
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:41,568
Delivering incredible performance
with leading power efficiency

1284
01:16:41,602 --> 01:16:43,437
is a hallmark of Apple silicon.

1285
01:16:43,470 --> 01:16:47,140
A16 has nearly 16 billion transistors,

1286
01:16:47,174 --> 01:16:49,943
the most ever in an iPhone.

1287
01:16:49,977 --> 01:16:54,548
This is our first chip built
on a state-of-the-art 4-nanometer process,

1288
01:16:54,581 --> 01:16:58,886
enabling greater efficiency
while delivering even more performance.

1289
01:16:58,919 --> 01:17:03,290
In fact, A16 Bionic is the fastest chip
ever in a smartphone.

1290
01:17:04,424 --> 01:17:08,028
The competition is still working
to catch up with the performance of A13

1291
01:17:08,061 --> 01:17:11,265
which we first introduced with iPhone 11
three years ago.

1292
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:16,003
The new 6-core CPU of A16
is generations ahead.

1293
01:17:16,036 --> 01:17:20,340
It's up to a whopping 40% faster
than the competition.

1294
01:17:20,374 --> 01:17:23,810
The CPU uses
our best-in-class fusion architecture

1295
01:17:23,844 --> 01:17:27,447
which delivers both leading performance
and leading efficiency.

1296
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:32,052
Our two high-performance cores are faster
and use 20% lower power

1297
01:17:32,085 --> 01:17:34,288
compared to A15 Bionic.

1298
01:17:34,321 --> 01:17:37,391
And most daily tasks can be handled
by our high-efficiency cores.

1299
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:40,527
At the same performance level,
these new efficiency cores

1300
01:17:40,561 --> 01:17:44,398
use one-third the power
of even the best of the efficiency cores

1301
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:46,533
from the competition.

1302
01:17:46,567 --> 01:17:49,603
This allows iPhone to deliver
amazing battery life

1303
01:17:49,636 --> 01:17:52,372
while still being extremely responsive.

1304
01:17:52,406 --> 01:17:54,074
The new 16-core Neural Engine

1305
01:17:54,107 --> 01:17:58,278
is capable of nearly 17 trillion
operations per second,

1306
01:17:58,312 --> 01:18:02,182
which helps power iPhone's
advanced computational photography.

1307
01:18:02,216 --> 01:18:06,620
And the 5-core GPU
has 50% more memory bandwidth–

1308
01:18:06,653 --> 01:18:08,722
great for graphic-intensive games.

1309
01:18:09,489 --> 01:18:12,759
There's also
an entirely new display engine in A16.

1310
01:18:12,793 --> 01:18:17,264
This engine enables the 1Hz refresh rate,
Always-On capability,

1311
01:18:17,297 --> 01:18:20,868
higher peak brightness,
and the advanced anti-aliasing

1312
01:18:20,901 --> 01:18:25,172
that makes Dynamic Island animations
so incredibly smooth.

1313
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:30,210
A16 also flexes every muscle
for the iPhone 14 Pro camera system.

1314
01:18:30,244 --> 01:18:34,781
It uses the CPU, GPU,
Neural Engine, and ISP

1315
01:18:34,815 --> 01:18:39,253
to perform up to 4 trillion operations
per photo.

1316
01:18:39,286 --> 01:18:42,689
And the image signal processor
was designed to support a new generation

1317
01:18:42,723 --> 01:18:47,194
of technology that provides
our most powerful Pro camera system ever.

1318
01:18:48,328 --> 01:18:51,465
This empowers every user
to take their best photos and videos–

1319
01:18:51,498 --> 01:18:54,034
from the casual user to the professional.

1320
01:18:54,067 --> 01:18:59,173
We're excited for iPhone 14 Pro to push
the boundaries for what's possible

1321
01:18:59,206 --> 01:19:02,643
and usher in a new era
for iPhone photography.

1322
01:19:02,676 --> 01:19:04,545
To tell you more, here's Vitor.

1323
01:19:04,578 --> 01:19:08,949
♪ ♪

1324
01:19:08,982 --> 01:19:14,388
Vitor Silva: iPhone 14 Pro introduces
a brand-new class of camera to iPhone:

1325
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:19,626
a 48MP camera
with a quad-pixel sensor.

1326
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:21,528
It is our largest sensor yet–

1327
01:19:21,562 --> 01:19:26,466
65% larger than the one on iPhone 13 Pro–

1328
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:30,103
features our 2nd-generation
sensor-shift OIS,

1329
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:32,739
and 100% focus pixels.

1330
01:19:32,773 --> 01:19:37,144
It also features a new 24mm focal length,

1331
01:19:37,177 --> 01:19:38,478
popular in photography

1332
01:19:38,512 --> 01:19:41,481
for its versatility
to shoot great landscapes,

1333
01:19:41,515 --> 01:19:44,251
group portraits, even single subjects.

1334
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:48,422
The quad-pixel sensor enables
a new flexible approach

1335
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:51,225
which adapts to the photo you're shooting.

1336
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:55,429
For most photos,
we want to optimize for light capture.

1337
01:19:56,230 --> 01:20:02,402
So the new sensor groups every four pixels
into one large quad-pixel,

1338
01:20:02,436 --> 01:20:03,804
with four times more light.

1339
01:20:04,671 --> 01:20:07,040
This further improves light capture

1340
01:20:07,074 --> 01:20:11,745
while maintaining
the practical 12MP photo size.

1341
01:20:11,778 --> 01:20:13,981
Combined with the new Photonic Engine,

1342
01:20:14,014 --> 01:20:16,116
the new Main camera has up to

1343
01:20:16,149 --> 01:20:19,152
two times low-light improvement
for photos

1344
01:20:19,186 --> 01:20:21,989
compared to iPhone 13 Pro.

1345
01:20:22,022 --> 01:20:25,092
Let's take a look at what
the Main camera can do.

1346
01:20:25,125 --> 01:20:29,363
You can capture stunning photos
across all lighting conditions.

1347
01:20:29,396 --> 01:20:32,666
In this brighter shot,
the Main camera captured

1348
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:35,435
the beautiful, rich color of her skin,

1349
01:20:35,469 --> 01:20:38,038
the detail of the fiber in the blanket,

1350
01:20:38,071 --> 01:20:40,340
and even a little of her joy.

1351
01:20:41,208 --> 01:20:45,179
For this photo, we locked exposure
on the woman's face.

1352
01:20:45,212 --> 01:20:49,616
As the vibrant feathers fell,
iPhone kept her in sharp focus

1353
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:52,386
while creating a colorful texture
around her.

1354
01:20:53,253 --> 01:20:56,657
In this low-light example,
the Photonic Engine captures

1355
01:20:56,690 --> 01:20:58,825
incredible dynamic range,

1356
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:01,295
from the warm glow of her skin,

1357
01:21:01,328 --> 01:21:02,930
the color of her eyes,

1358
01:21:02,963 --> 01:21:07,167
to every little crease, fold,
and texture in the garment.

1359
01:21:08,769 --> 01:21:14,141
The new sensor can optimize for detail
using each pixel individually,

1360
01:21:14,174 --> 01:21:20,314
providing more creative options
for shooting and editing in pro workflows.

1361
01:21:20,347 --> 01:21:24,918
With this approach we can go beyond
the three fixed lenses

1362
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:26,653
of the Pro camera system,

1363
01:21:26,687 --> 01:21:31,325
adding a new 2x Telephoto option
for our users.

1364
01:21:31,358 --> 01:21:35,963
We use the middle 12 megapixels
of the new sensor

1365
01:21:35,996 --> 01:21:38,765
to deliver a full-resolution photo

1366
01:21:38,799 --> 01:21:42,269
and 4K video with optical quality.

1367
01:21:42,302 --> 01:21:47,140
This Telephoto has larger pixels
and a faster aperture

1368
01:21:47,174 --> 01:21:51,345
than any previous 2x Telephoto camera
on iPhone,

1369
01:21:51,378 --> 01:21:54,381
delivering incredible photos and videos.

1370
01:21:55,082 --> 01:21:59,720
And it has a familiar focal length
that is great for Portrait mode,

1371
01:21:59,753 --> 01:22:02,990
capturing stunning detail
with beautiful bokeh.

1372
01:22:03,524 --> 01:22:09,429
We're also using the new sensor
to optimize for detail in ProRAW.

1373
01:22:09,463 --> 01:22:13,867
ProRAW merges the best of our
intelligent computational photography

1374
01:22:13,901 --> 01:22:16,236
with the benefits of the RAW format,

1375
01:22:16,270 --> 01:22:19,973
giving Pro photographers
full creative control

1376
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:23,143
over things like sharpening,
white balance,

1377
01:22:23,177 --> 01:22:28,182
and our advanced tone mapping
with more bit depth and dynamic range.

1378
01:22:28,215 --> 01:22:33,287
You can now shoot ProRAW
at 48MP resolution,

1379
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:37,124
taking advantage of every pixel
in the Main camera

1380
01:22:37,157 --> 01:22:40,527
and unlocking incredible
editing flexibility.

1381
01:22:40,561 --> 01:22:43,797
The new sensor has
a different pixel pattern,

1382
01:22:43,830 --> 01:22:46,667
so we designed
a new machine learning model

1383
01:22:46,700 --> 01:22:50,370
that further enhances detail
and reduces noise.

1384
01:22:50,404 --> 01:22:54,541
This leverages the full power
of A16 Bionic

1385
01:22:54,575 --> 01:22:59,346
and results in an unprecedented level
of detail.

1386
01:22:59,379 --> 01:23:02,149
It's unbelievable how much we can zoom in,

1387
01:23:02,182 --> 01:23:05,485
like in this ethereal photo in Hawaii,

1388
01:23:05,519 --> 01:23:08,589
revealing each individual rock
on the beach,

1389
01:23:08,622 --> 01:23:11,225
and even dry branches from the trees.

1390
01:23:11,258 --> 01:23:16,129
With more pixels,
Pro photographers can reframe their photos

1391
01:23:16,163 --> 01:23:18,532
while still retaining great resolution.

1392
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:23,670
We are able to keep the sharpness
and warmth of her eyes

1393
01:23:23,704 --> 01:23:27,074
as the focal point
of this high-resolution image.

1394
01:23:27,875 --> 01:23:32,679
This makes the 48MP Main camera
even more versatile,

1395
01:23:32,713 --> 01:23:37,150
further empowering the creativity
of the most Pro users.

1396
01:23:37,184 --> 01:23:41,288
iPhone 14 Pro also has
a new Ultra Wide camera,

1397
01:23:41,321 --> 01:23:44,491
with a larger sensor, more focus pixels

1398
01:23:44,525 --> 01:23:47,094
and–together with the Photonic Engine–

1399
01:23:47,127 --> 01:23:50,564
delivers a massive,
up to three times, improvement

1400
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:53,066
in light capture for photos.

1401
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:56,136
The new lens is sharper, with more detail,

1402
01:23:56,170 --> 01:23:58,238
so macro gets even better,

1403
01:23:58,272 --> 01:24:00,507
like this katydid bug

1404
01:24:00,541 --> 01:24:02,476
captured in a split second

1405
01:24:02,509 --> 01:24:06,647
to reveal more
than was visible to the naked eye.

1406
01:24:06,680 --> 01:24:11,118
The flash was completely redesigned
for a new adaptive behavior

1407
01:24:11,151 --> 01:24:13,487
based on the focal length of the photo.

1408
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:19,159
With a new array of nine LEDs,
we control the pattern and intensity.

1409
01:24:19,193 --> 01:24:21,929
So it's up to twice as bright,

1410
01:24:21,962 --> 01:24:24,331
with up to three times better uniformity

1411
01:24:24,364 --> 01:24:26,900

1412
01:24:26,934 --> 01:24:32,206
And with the new Photonic Engine,
