1039
01:01:02,229 --> 01:01:06,266
While iPhone is designed for a best-in-class cellular experience,
虽然 iPhone 能提供行业领先的蜂窝网络体验

1040
01:01:06,300 --> 01:01:10,671
connecting to a satellite presents an entirely new set of challenges.
但连接到卫星意味着一系列全新的挑战

1041
01:01:10,704 --> 01:01:14,341
Smartphones connect to cell towers that are a few miles away.
智能手机通常都是连接到几英里外的信号塔

1042
01:01:14,374 --> 01:01:15,843
Over the last several decades,
在过去的几十年里

1043
01:01:15,876 --> 01:01:18,345
carriers have built more and more cell towers
运营商建造了越来越多的信号塔

1044
01:01:18,378 --> 01:01:21,849
to improve the strength and speed of their network service.
来提升网络服务的强度和速度

1045
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:26,353
However, there are some places– like winding back roads
但是有些地方 比如在曲折的道路和山脊上

1046
01:01:26,386 --> 01:01:29,189
and mountain ridges– that cell towers don't reach.
手机信号塔覆盖不到

1047
01:01:30,324 --> 01:01:35,329
Connectivity in these areas can be provided by communication satellites.
这些区域的连接可以由通信卫星提供

1048
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,431
Unlike stationary cell towers,
与固定的信号塔不同

1049
01:01:37,464 --> 01:01:40,834
communication satellites are hundreds of miles above the Earth,
通信卫星位于地球上方数百英里的高空

1050
01:01:40,868 --> 01:01:44,638
and flying at over 15,000 miles per hour.
并以超过 15000 英里/小时的速度飞行

1051
01:01:45,072 --> 01:01:48,008
To connect to these satellites, you need to be outside,
要与这些卫星连接 你需要身处户外

1052
01:01:48,041 --> 01:01:50,210
with a clear view of the sky.
能清楚看到天空

1053
01:01:50,244 --> 01:01:54,014
And the bandwidth is so limited that even sending a text message
而且带宽非常有限 发一条信息

1054
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,949
is a technical challenge.
都是一项技术挑战

1055
01:01:55,983 --> 01:01:58,552
Typically, the only way to tap into such a network
通常来说 接入此类网络的唯一方法

1056
01:01:58,585 --> 01:02:02,689
is with an expensive device that uses a bulky external antenna.
是使用昂贵的设备 附带笨重的外部天线

1057
01:02:02,723 --> 01:02:06,093
We knew that approach just wouldn't work for iPhone.
我们知道 iPhone 并不适合使用这种方式

1058
01:02:06,126 --> 01:02:08,595
So we invented another way.
于是 我们发明了另一种方式

1059
01:02:08,629 --> 01:02:13,100
We designed and built custom components and specific software
我们设计制造了定制组件和特定软件

1060
01:02:13,133 --> 01:02:17,604
so that iPhone 14 antennas can connect to satellites' unique frequencies.
使 iPhone 14 的天线能连接到卫星的独特频率

1061
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:21,542
That connection is only possible when the phone is pointing
只有当手机直接指向卫星时

1062
01:02:21,575 --> 01:02:23,544
directly at a satellite.
这种连接才能实现

1063
01:02:23,577 --> 01:02:27,681
However, satellites fly too high to be seen by the human eye.
然而卫星飞得太高 人的肉眼是看不到的

1064
01:02:27,714 --> 01:02:32,719
So we created a unique user experience that shows you where to point your phone
因此 我们创造了独特的用户体验 告诉你要将手机指向何处

1065
01:02:32,753 --> 01:02:37,191
to establish a connection, and stay connected as the satellite moves.
才能建立连接 并在卫星移动时保持连接

1066
01:02:37,224 --> 01:02:40,694
This way, no bulky antenna is needed.
这样 就不再需要笨重的天线了

1067
01:02:41,428 --> 01:02:44,198
Once connected, you need to send and receive
连接上之后

1068
01:02:44,231 --> 01:02:47,034
enough information to get emergency help.
你需要发送和接收足够的信息 才能获得紧急救助

1069
01:02:47,801 --> 01:02:50,204
Standard messaging protocols are not designed
标准的信息传送协议

1070
01:02:50,237 --> 01:02:52,206
for a satellite's limited bandwidth.
并不适用于带宽有限的卫星

1071
01:02:52,239 --> 01:02:55,976
So we created a custom short text compression algorithm
因此我们研发了定制短文本压缩算法

1072
01:02:56,009 --> 01:02:59,813
to reduce the average size of messages by a factor of three.
将信息的平均文件大小减小三倍

1073
01:02:59,847 --> 01:03:03,250
Thanks to this algorithm, it can take less than 15 seconds
有了这种算法 可能不到 15 秒就能发送一条信息

1074
01:03:03,283 --> 01:03:06,687
to send a message if you have a clear view of the sky.
如果你能清楚地看到天空

1075
01:03:06,720 --> 01:03:09,189
In other conditions, such as light foliage,
在其他条件下 比如在树荫里

1076
01:03:09,223 --> 01:03:11,158
it may take a few minutes.
可能需要几分钟

1077
01:03:11,191 --> 01:03:13,927
And since each message can take some time,
由于发送每条信息都可能需要一些时间

1078
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,163
we knew a standard back-and-forth conversation
日常的来回对话模式

1079
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:19,366
would take far too long for an emergency situation.
对于紧急情况来说过于耗时

1080
01:03:19,399 --> 01:03:22,503
We worked with emergency experts to surface the questions
我们与应急专家合作

1081
01:03:22,536 --> 01:03:24,571
they're most likely to ask,
讨论了紧急服务人员最常问的问题

1082
01:03:24,605 --> 01:03:26,507
and we provided the most common responses
并提供最常见的回答

1083
01:03:26,540 --> 01:03:29,576
for you to choose from with just a few taps.
以供用户轻点选择

1084
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:31,945
With fewer messages to write and send,
越少需要编写发送的信息

1085
01:03:31,979 --> 01:03:34,414
you can get help quicker.
你也就更快能获得救援

1086
01:03:34,448 --> 01:03:36,817
After your message is relayed to a ground station,
当你的信息转发到地面站后

1087
01:03:36,850 --> 01:03:40,053
it needs to reach the right emergency service provider.
还需要传送给正确的紧急救援机构

1088
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:43,290
If that emergency service provider accepts text messages,
如果该紧急救援机构能接收信息

1089
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:45,692
we will connect you to them directly.
我们会帮助你直接与他们联系

1090
01:03:45,726 --> 01:03:49,763
If they only accept voice calls, we have set up Relay Centers,
如果他们只接受语音通话 我们设立了中继中心

1091
01:03:49,796 --> 01:03:52,466
staffed with highly-trained emergency specialists
配备训练有素的紧急救援专家

1092
01:03:52,499 --> 01:03:57,271
ready to get your text and call an emergency service provider on your behalf.
随时接收你的信息 并代表你致电紧急救援机构

1093
01:03:57,304 --> 01:04:00,107
It took years to make this vision a reality
我们花了数年才实现这一愿景

1094
01:04:00,140 --> 01:04:04,811
through game-changing hardware, software, and infrastructure innovation.
依靠的是颠覆性的硬件、软件和基础设施创新

1095
01:04:05,412 --> 01:04:07,848
This breakthrough service can also be used

1096
01:04:07,881 --> 01:04:10,951
in more casual, less dire circumstances.
也可以在危急程度没有那么高的日常情况下使用

1097
01:04:10,984 --> 01:04:13,987
So if you're out on a long hike, you can use the Find My app

1098
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:17,524
to share your location manually via satellite.
