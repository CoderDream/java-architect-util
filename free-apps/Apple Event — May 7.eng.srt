you can just squeeze it to bring up a new tool palette.

688
00:31:29.122 --> 00:31:30.891
And when you squeeze the Pencil,

689
00:31:30.924 --> 00:31:35.429
a haptic engine delivers precise feedback that you can feel.

690
00:31:35.462 --> 00:31:38.699
A gyroscope allows you to roll the Pencil

691
00:31:38.732 --> 00:31:41.235
for precise control of the tool you're using,

692
00:31:41.268 --> 00:31:45.606
