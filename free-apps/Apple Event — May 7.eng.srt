00:16:32.826 --> 00:16:34.561
Let's take a look.

345
00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:39.233
When I swipe from the top-right corner, I can see Control Center,

346
00:16:34.595 --> 00:16:39.233
When I swipe from the top-right corner, I can see Control Center,

347
00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:42.402
with all my controls organized in one place.

348
00:16:39.266 --> 00:16:42.402
with all my controls organized in one place.

349
00:16:42.436 --> 00:16:46.273
And now Control Center isn't limited to just the controls you see here.

350
00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:49.476
I can swipe to multiple new groups of controls,

351
00:16:46.306 --> 00:16:49.476
I can swipe to multiple new groups of controls,

352
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.512
like for Media Playback.

353
00:16:51.545 --> 00:16:53.814
You can see how beautiful this looks.

354
00:16:53.847 --> 00:16:56.149
And here are my Home Controls.

355
00:16:56.183 --> 00:16:59.753
It's so useful to have everything arranged for me like this.

356
00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:03.357
Oh, that shouldn't be open. Let me close the garage.

357
00:16:59.786 --> 00:17:03.357
Oh, that shouldn't be open. Let me close the garage.

358
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.630
And what's really great is, I can get to any one of these groups

359
00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:09.630
And what's really great is, I can get to any one of these groups

360
00:17:09.663 --> 00:17:12.598
with a single, continuous swipe.

361
00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:18.271
I can get straight to my Home Controls, for instance, or right back up to the top.

362
00:17:12.633 --> 00:17:18.271
I can get straight to my Home Controls, for instance, or right back up to the top.

363
00:17:18.305 --> 00:17:23.644
To add more controls, I can open up the new Controls Gallery,

364
00:17:23.676 --> 00:17:26.146
where I have so many options to choose from.

365
00:17:23.676 --> 00:17:26.146
where I have so many options to choose from.

366
00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:29.850
We wanted to make Control Center more extensible than ever.

367
00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:34.488
So now, developers can include controls from their apps as well!

368
00:17:29.883 --> 00:17:34.488
So now, developers can include controls from their apps as well!

369
00:17:34.521 --> 00:17:36.290
Like this one from Ford.

370
00:17:36.323 --> 00:17:39.293
Let's add that in.

371
00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:44.798
I can adjust how my controls are laid out and resize them too.

372
00:17:39.326 --> 00:17:44.798
I can adjust how my controls are laid out and resize them too.

373
00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:49.903
Now I can cool down the car just like that.

374
00:17:44.831 --> 00:17:49.903
Now I can cool down the car just like that.

375
00:17:49.937 --> 00:17:53.006
So that's the new Control Center!

376
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.445
To enable new controls in Control Center, we have a new Controls API for developers.

377
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.445
To enable new controls in Control Center, we have a new Controls API for developers.

378
00:17:58.478 --> 00:17:59.847
And that's not all.

379
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.383
These new controls are also available from the Lock Screen,

380
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:03.383
These new controls are also available from the Lock Screen,

381
00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:06.820
so you can swap the camera and flashlight for different controls,

382
00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:06.820
so you can swap the camera and flashlight for different controls,

383
00:18:06.854 --> 00:18:09.389
like taking a note when an idea strikes,

384
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:12.359
or quickly capturing the moment for your Snapchat.

385
00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:12.359
or quickly capturing the moment for your Snapchat.

386
00:18:12.392 --> 00:18:16.396
And you can even use the Action button on iPhone 15 Pro

387
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:19.366
to invoke these new controls.

388
00:18:19.399 --> 00:18:22.269
Another key part of personalizing iOS

389
00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:25.906
is about keeping you in control of your privacy.

390
00:18:22.302 --> 00:18:25.906
is about keeping you in control of your privacy.

391
00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:30.677
And iOS 18 gives you even more ways to control who can see your apps,

392
00:18:25.939 --> 00:18:30.677
And iOS 18 gives you even more ways to control who can see your apps,

393
00:18:30.711 --> 00:18:35.482
how you share your contacts, and how you connect to accessories.

394
00:18:35.516 --> 00:18:37.484
Let's start with apps.

395
00:18:37.518 --> 00:18:40.187
Sometimes we hand our device to someone

396
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.090
so they can look at a photo or play a game,

397
00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.090
so they can look at a photo or play a game,

398
00:18:43.123 --> 00:18:47.694
but we want peace of mind that they can't get into sensitive areas of our phone.

399
00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:51.732
So this year, we're giving you a new way to protect sensitive apps

400
00:18:47.728 --> 00:18:51.732
So this year, we're giving you a new way to protect sensitive apps

401
00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:56.036
and the information inside them, by letting you lock an app.

402
00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:56.036
and the information inside them, by letting you lock an app.

403
00:18:56.069 --> 00:18:59.439
When you choose to lock an app, if someone else tries to tap it,

404
00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:04.745
they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.

405
00:18:59.473 --> 00:19:04.745
they will be required to authenticate using Face ID, Touch ID, or your passcode.

406
00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:07.814
And information from inside the app won't appear

407
00:19:04.778 --> 00:19:07.814
And information from inside the app won't appear

408
00:19:07.848 --> 00:19:11.919
in other places across the system, like in search and notifications,

409
00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:15.489
so others won't inadvertently see sensitive information.

410
00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:15.489
so others won't inadvertently see sensitive information.

411
00:19:15.522 --> 00:19:18.458
There may also be occasions when you want to hide an app

412
00:19:15.522 --> 00:19:18.458
There may also be occasions when you want to hide an app

413
00:19:18.492 --> 00:19:22.095
that you don't want others to know is installed on your device.

414
00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:26.400
For example, say you use a professional grade spatial capture app

415
00:19:22.129 --> 00:19:26.400
For example, say you use a professional grade spatial capture app

416
00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.202
to track your different hairstyles.

417
00:19:28.235 --> 00:19:30.437
I mean, that's just good science, right?

418
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:35.275
Well, anyway, say you use this app, but you don't want anyone else to know.

419
00:19:35.309 --> 00:19:38.178
Well, now you can hide it

420
00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:42.182
and put it in a new hidden apps folder that's locked.

421
00:19:38.212 --> 00:19:42.182
and put it in a new hidden apps folder that's locked.

422
00:19:42.216 --> 00:19:46.019
We're also adding new ways to control how you share information with apps,

423
00:19:46.053 --> 00:19:48.488
starting with contacts.

424
00:19:48.522 --> 00:19:51.258
Today, when you give an app access to your contacts,

425
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:54.595
it can learn about all the people you've added over time.

426
00:19:51.291 --> 00:19:54.595
it can learn about all the people you've added over time.

427
00:19:54.628 --> 00:19:57.698
In iOS 18, we're putting you in control

428
00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:01.869
by letting you decide which contacts an app can see.

429
00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:01.869
by letting you decide which contacts an app can see.

430
00:20:01.902 --> 00:20:05.405
We're also putting you in control when you pair accessories.

431
00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:09.309
An app may ask for Bluetooth and local network access

432
00:20:05.439 --> 00:20:09.309
An app may ask for Bluetooth and local network access

433
00:20:09.343 --> 00:20:13.313
but also gain visibility to all the other devices on your network,

434
00:20:09.343 --> 00:20:13.313
but also gain visibility to all the other devices on your network,

435
00:20:13.347 --> 00:20:15.048
from your computers and TVs

436
00:20:15.082 --> 00:20:17.684
to your door locks and blood pressure monitor.

437
00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:22.623
Now, developers can offer you an intuitive new way to pair your accessories

438
00:20:17.718 --> 00:20:22.623
Now, developers can offer you an intuitive new way to pair your accessories

439
00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:26.693
that keeps your devices private and makes pairing seamless.

440
00:20:22.656 --> 00:20:26.693
that keeps your devices private and makes pairing seamless.

441
00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:31.565
Next up, we have big enhancements to the apps we use to stay connected,

442
00:20:26.727 --> 00:20:31.565
Next up, we have big enhancements to the apps we use to stay connected,

443
00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:33.700
starting with Messages.

444
00:20:33.734 --> 00:20:36.737
To tell you more, here's Ronak.

445
00:20:38.405 --> 00:20:40.774
Ronak Shah: Messages is central to how we communicate

446
00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:43.177
with the most important people in our lives,

447
00:20:40.807 --> 00:20:43.177
with the most important people in our lives,

448
00:20:43.210 --> 00:20:46.847
so in iOS 18, we're giving you all-new ways

449
00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.117
to express yourself and stay connected.

450
00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:52.386
Let's start with Tapbacks.

451
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:56.456
Tapbacks are one of the most popular ways to express yourself in Messages.

452
00:20:52.419 --> 00:20:56.456
Tapbacks are one of the most popular ways to express yourself in Messages.

453
00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:58.025
And people love them.

454
00:20:58.058 --> 00:21:01.094
This is a huge year for Tapbacks.

455
00:21:01.128 --> 00:21:03.430
We've not only redesigned your favorites.

456
00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:06.500
We're now giving you limitless ways to express yourself

457
00:21:03.463 --> 00:21:06.500
We're now giving you limitless ways to express yourself

458
00:21:06.533 --> 00:21:09.736
by letting you Tapback with any emoji or sticker.

459
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.241
Next, we're bringing one of your most requested features to Messages.

460
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:14.241
Next, we're bringing one of your most requested features to Messages.

461
00:21:14.274 --> 00:21:17.044
When you don't want to forget to send that friendly reminder

462
00:21:17.077 --> 00:21:18.912
or birthday text in the morning,

463
00:21:18.946 --> 00:21:22.316
you can schedule your message to Send Later.

464
00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:26.687
We're also giving you more ways to express your tone with text formatting.

465
00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:26.687
We're also giving you more ways to express your tone with text formatting.

466
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.958
Bold, italicize, underline, or strike through any text.

467
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.958
Bold, italicize, underline, or strike through any text.

468
00:21:30.991 --> 00:21:34.094
And when formatting is not enough, we're introducing a new way

469
00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:37.397
to visually amplify your messages with text effects!

470
00:21:34.127 --> 00:21:37.397
to visually amplify your messages with text effects!

471
00:21:37.431 --> 00:21:40.367
Whether you want to emphasize some major news,

472
00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.935
bring your emoji to life,

473
00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.305
or you're just blown away by a stunning photo,

474
00:21:41.969 --> 00:21:45.305
or you're just blown away by a stunning photo,

475
00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:49.376
you can express yourself in all-new ways with text effects.

476
00:21:45.339 --> 00:21:49.376
you can express yourself in all-new ways with text effects.

477
00:21:49.409 --> 00:21:53.247
Some words and phrases automatically surface a suggestion,

478
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.117
so you can quickly select one and send it.

479
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.255
And you can also add one of the many new effects to any text.

480
00:21:57.150 --> 00:22:01.255
And you can also add one of the many new effects to any text.

481
00:22:03.757 --> 00:22:06.560
Last, there's a new way to stay connected

482
00:22:06.593 --> 00:22:09.563
whenever you don't have Wi-Fi or cellular service.

483
00:22:09.596 --> 00:22:11.765
We're using the same groundbreaking technology

484
00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:17.070
that gave us Emergency SOS via satellite to bring you Messages via satellite.

485
00:22:11.798 --> 00:22:17.070
that gave us Emergency SOS via satellite to bring you Messages via satellite.

486
00:22:17.104 --> 00:22:21.675
Now you can use the satellite capabilities on iPhone 14 and later

487
00:22:17.104 --> 00:22:21.675
Now you can use the satellite capabilities on iPhone 14 and later

488
00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:24.044
to connect to satellites hundreds of miles above the Earth

489
00:22:21.708 --> 00:22:24.044
to connect to satellites hundreds of miles above the Earth

490
00:22:24.077 --> 00:22:26.547
to text your friends and family when you're off the grid

491
00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:28.849
all right from the Messages app.

492
00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:32.653
Once you've connected, you'll be able to use key iMessage features

493
00:22:28.882 --> 00:22:32.653
Once you've connected, you'll be able to use key iMessage features

494
00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:36.557
like sending and receiving messages, emoji, and Tapbacks.

495
00:22:32.686 --> 00:22:36.557
like sending and receiving messages, emoji, and Tapbacks.

496
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.760
Because iMessage was built to protect your privacy,

497
00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:43.730
iMessages sent over satellite are end-to-end encrypted.

498
00:22:39.793 --> 00:22:43.730
iMessages sent over satellite are end-to-end encrypted.

499
00:22:43.764 --> 00:22:46.600
And if you need to text people not on iMessage,

500
00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:50.304
we're supporting SMS messaging via satellite too.

501
00:22:46.633 --> 00:22:50.304
we're supporting SMS messaging via satellite too.

502
00:22:50.337 --> 00:22:54.975
Now, let's talk about another app we use to communicate, Mail.

503
00:22:50.337 --> 00:22:54.975
Now, let's talk about another app we use to communicate, Mail.

504
00:22:55.008 --> 00:22:57.811
This year, we're giving you a new way to stay in control

505
00:22:57.845 --> 00:23:01.715
and manage incoming email with on-device categorization

506
00:22:57.845 --> 00:23:01.715
and manage incoming email with on-device categorization

507
00:23:01.748 --> 00:23:03.417
that organizes your messages

508
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.054
and helps you stay up to date across all of your accounts.

509
00:23:03.450 --> 00:23:07.054
and helps you stay up to date across all of your accounts.

510
00:23:07.087 --> 00:23:11.325

so we've built on the amazing intelligence in the Photos app

623
00:27:39.226 --> 00:27:41.562

643
00:28:30.043 --> 00:28:34.348
And it now includes my favorite groups of people for the first time!

644
00:28:34.381 --> 00:28:36.950
Here's me with my husband Don

645
00:28:36.984 --> 00:28:38.752

651
00:28:51.632 --> 00:28:55.869
like this one to Patagonia in 2021.

And you can customize this too.

ensuring that the actors' dialogue will always cut through.

775
00:33:59.439 --> 00:34:00.841
- Go, go, go, go, go!

776
00:34:00.874 --> 00:34:03.410
- Rory, you are driving recklessly.

777
00:34:03.443 --> 00:34:05.546

783
00:34:14.821 --> 00:34:17.357

David Clark: My Apple Watch always motivates me to stay active.

821
00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:06.600
And this year will be no different.

822
00:36:06.633 --> 00:36:09.403

to not only keep you active but also healthy and connected.

825
00:36:12.940 --> 00:36:16.743
To help you stay active, let's first take a look at an exciting new feature

826
00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:20.047
that can transform the way you work out, whether you are training

827
00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:20.047
that can transform the way you work out, whether you are training

828
00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.650
for something like your first 5K or your fastest marathon.

829
00:36:23.684 --> 00:36:26.720
In watchOS 11, we're introducing Training Load,

830
00:36:23.684 --> 00:36:26.720
In watchOS 11, we're introducing Training Load,

831
00:36:26.753 --> 00:36:29.523
an insightful way to measure how the intensity and duration

832
00:36:29.556 --> 00:36:33.160
of your workouts are impacting your body over time.

833
00:36:29.556 --> 00:36:33.160
of your workouts are impacting your body over time.

834
00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:36.864
To track intensity, we designed a new way to rate your workouts.

835
00:36:33.193 --> 00:36:36.864
To track intensity, we designed a new way to rate your workouts.

836
00:36:36.897 --> 00:36:41.368
Using calorimetry data, like heart rate, pace, and elevation,

837
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:43.904
plus your personal data, like age and weight,

838
00:36:41.401 --> 00:36:43.904
plus your personal data, like age and weight,

839
00:36:43.937 --> 00:36:47.541
a powerful new algorithm automatically translates our sensor data

840
00:36:47.574 --> 00:36:50.077
into an estimate of your Effort rating.

841
00:36:50.110 --> 00:36:53.213
After your workout, you can review the rating on the Summary page,

842
00:36:53.247 --> 00:36:57.417
ranging from 1, easy, to 10, all out.

843
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:01.889
And you can even adjust your Effort rating up or down to get it just right.

844
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:01.889
And you can even adjust your Effort rating up or down to get it just right.

845
00:37:01.922 --> 00:37:04.892
Your Effort rating and workout duration are then used

846
00:37:04.925 --> 00:37:06.894
to calculate your Training Load.

847
00:37:06.927 --> 00:37:09.329
You'll be able to see if you're holding steady,

above your average and can safely progress and improve,

850
00:37:12.633 --> 00:37:15.802
or when you're well above your average and should pay close attention

851
00:37:15.836 --> 00:37:18.438
to better avoid exhaustion or injury.

852
00:37:18.472 --> 00:37:21.909
We think Training Load will help enthusiasts and elite athletes

853
00:37:21.942 --> 00:37:25.212
get to the next level with data, insights,

854

855
00:37:25.245 --> 00:37:29.516
and motivation they need to make the best decisions about their training.

856
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.987
And we've now made it even easier for everyone to gain more insights

857
00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.987
And we've now made it even easier for everyone to gain more insights

858
00:37:34.021 --> 00:37:36.590
from the Fitness app on iPhone by giving you the ability

860
00:37:36.623 --> 00:37:40.561
to customize the Summary Tab to show the information you want to see,

861
00:37:40.594 --> 00:37:43.163
including new metrics like weekly running distance.

862
00:37:40.594 --> 00:37:43.163
including new metrics like weekly running distance.

863
00:37:43.197 --> 00:37:46.066
The personalization even extends to your Activity rings

864
00:37:46.099 --> 00:37:49.169
where you can now adjust your goals by the day of the week.

865
00:37:46.099 --> 00:37:49.169
where you can now adjust your goals by the day of the week.

866
00:37:49.203 --> 00:37:52.973
Or if you have an injury that's making it harder to close your rings,

867
00:37:53.006 --> 00:37:55.709
or maybe you just need a day off, you can pause them,

868
00:37:53.006 --> 00:37:55.709
or maybe you just need a day off, you can pause them,

869
00:37:55.742 --> 00:38:00.147
for a rest day, week, or more and keep your award streak going!

00:37:55.742 --> 00:38:00.147
for a rest day, week, or more and keep your award streak going!

871
00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:04.451
Those are some of the new ways watchOS11 will help keep you active.

872
00:38:04.484 --> 00:38:07.287
And now here's Sumbul to tell you about a new app

873
00:38:04.484 --> 00:38:07.287
And now here's Sumbul to tell you about a new app

874
00:38:07.321 --> 00:38:09.389
that will give you a better picture of your health.

Dr. Sumbul Ahmad Desai: Understanding how your body responds

877
00:38:13.026 --> 00:38:16.330
and recovers from exercise and other aspects of your life

878
00:38:16.363 --> 00:38:19.032
is an important part of your overall health.

879
00:38:16.363 --> 00:38:19.032
is an important part of your overall health.

880
00:38:19.066 --> 00:38:21.835
Because Apple Watch can track key vitals while you sleep,

881
00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:24.705
like heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature,

882
00:38:21.869 --> 00:38:24.705
like heart rate, respiratory rate, and wrist temperature,

883
00:38:24.738 --> 00:38:27.508
it can give you a deeper understanding of your body

884
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:30.744
and help you identify when something might be off.

885
00:38:27.541 --> 00:38:30.744
and help you identify when something might be off.

886
00:38:30.777 --> 00:38:33.847
So with watchOS 11, these metrics are the foundation

887
00:38:33.881 --> 00:38:36.717
of the insightful new Vitals app

888
00:38:36.750 --> 00:38:39.319
where you can check in on your daily health status,

889
00:38:39.353 --> 00:38:43.056
and explore your most important health metrics with just a glance.

890
00:38:39.353 --> 00:38:43.056
and explore your most important health metrics with just a glance.

891
00:38:43.090 --> 00:38:46.093
You can also see how your metrics relate to your typical range,

892
00:38:46.126 --> 00:38:49.129
which is determined from your own historical information

893
00:38:46.126 --> 00:38:49.129
which is determined from your own historical information

894
00:38:49.162 --> 00:38:51.965
and an algorithm developed using real-world data

895
00:38:51.999 --> 00:38:54.067
from the Apple Heart and Movement Study.

896
00:38:54.101 --> 00:38:56.737
For additional insights, your metrics will be highlighted

897
00:38:56.770 --> 00:38:58.906
when they are outside of your typical range

898
00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:02.442
with details on what's changed over the last week.

899
00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:02.442
with details on what's changed over the last week.

900
00:39:02.476 --> 00:39:04.444
And when multiple metrics are out of range,

901
00:39:04.478 --> 00:39:07.981
you will be notified with a tailored message to help you understand

902
00:39:04.478 --> 00:39:07.981
you will be notified with a tailored message to help you understand

903
00:39:08.015 --> 00:39:11.318
how these changes may be linked to other aspects of your life,

904
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:14.888
such as alcohol, elevation changes, or even illness.

905
00:39:11.351 --> 00:39:14.888
such as alcohol, elevation changes, or even illness.

906
00:39:14.922 --> 00:39:18.392
And that's the Vitals app, a new way to quickly view

907
00:39:14.922 --> 00:39:18.392
And that's the Vitals app, a new way to quickly view

908
00:39:18.425 --> 00:39:21.695
your most important health metrics, receive alerts when it's time

909
00:39:21.728 --> 00:39:25.032
to pay more attention to your body, and gain better context

910
00:39:21.728 --> 00:39:25.032
to pay more attention to your body, and gain better context

911
00:39:25.065 --> 00:39:27.334
when it comes to your health.

912
00:39:27.367 --> 00:39:29.403
Now let's talk about another time

913
00:39:29.436 --> 00:39:33.073
when context about your health matters, which is during pregnancy.

914
00:39:29.436 --> 00:39:33.073
when context about your health matters, which is during pregnancy.

915
00:39:33.106 --> 00:39:36.043
Cycle Tracking can now show you gestational age

916
00:39:33.106 --> 00:39:36.043
Cycle Tracking can now show you gestational age

917
00:39:36.076 --> 00:39:38.679
to support you during this important time.

918
00:39:38.712 --> 00:39:41.882
The Health app will display your pregnancy across all charts

919
00:39:41.915 --> 00:39:43.584
and prompt you to review things

920
00:39:43.617 --> 00:39:45.919
like your high heart rate notification threshold,

921
00:39:45.953 --> 00:39:49.323
since heart rate often increases during pregnancy.

922
00:39:45.953 --> 00:39:49.323
since heart rate often increases during pregnancy.

923
00:39:49.356 --> 00:39:51.892
Those are some of the advances in Health.

924
00:39:51.925 --> 00:39:56.830
And now back to David to tell you what's coming to keep you connected.

925
00:39:51.925 --> 00:39:56.830
And now back to David to tell you what's coming to keep you connected.

926
00:39:56.864 --> 00:39:59.600

you can do it all with just the raise of a wrist.

938
00:40:20.687 --> 00:40:23.323
And last year, we introduced the Smart Stack.

939
00:40:23.357 --> 00:40:26.260
It's another way to keep you connected to important information

940

Apps are fundamental to the iPad experience.

1025
00:43:57.638 --> 00:44:00.941
Apps are fundamental to the iPad experience.

1026
00:44:00.974 --> 00:44:04.178
In iPadOS 18, we're making them even better,

1027
00:44:04.211 --> 00:44:07.014
starting with a new floating tab bar,

1028
00:44:07.047 --> 00:44:09.783
which makes it easier to navigate to different parts of an app

1029
00:44:09.816 --> 00:44:13.820
and keeps your content edge to edge in apps like Apple TV.

1030
00:44:09.816 --> 00:44:13.820
and keeps your content edge to edge in apps like Apple TV.

1031
00:44:13.854 --> 00:44:18.292
When you want to explore more, the tab bar morphs into the sidebar.

1032
00:44:13.854 --> 00:44:18.292
When you want to explore more, the tab bar morphs into the sidebar.

1033
00:44:18.325 --> 00:44:22.129
If you use a specific tab often, you can customize the tab bar

1034
00:44:22.162 --> 00:44:25.265
to keep your favorites within easy reach.

1035
00:44:25.299 --> 00:44:29.503
This redesigned experience works in apps across the system.

1036
00:44:29.536 --> 00:44:33.707
We've also made it easier to browse your documents in apps like Pages,

1037
00:44:29.536 --> 00:44:33.707
We've also made it easier to browse your documents in apps like Pages,

1038
00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.713
Keynote, Numbers, and Swift Playgrounds, giving each app a distinct new look.

1039
00:44:33.740 --> 00:44:39.713
Keynote, Numbers, and Swift Playgrounds, giving each app a distinct new look.

1040
00:44:39.746 --> 00:44:44.017
And throughout your experience, you'll discover refined animations.

1041
00:44:39.746 --> 00:44:44.017
And throughout your experience, you'll discover refined animations.

1042
00:44:44.051 --> 00:44:47.621
You'll notice them as you open files or preview them with Quick Look,

1043
00:44:47.654 --> 00:44:49.990
and they smoothly zoom into view,

1044
00:44:50.023 --> 00:44:53.994
or when the tab bar elegantly morphs into the sidebar and back.

1045
00:44:54.027 --> 00:44:58.332
Across apps, animations will feel even more responsive.

1046
00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:01.602
And for developers, all these new elements are

1047
00:44:58.365 --> 00:45:01.602
And for developers, all these new elements are

1048
00:45:01.635 --> 00:45:05.038
available as APIs to adopt in your apps too.

1049
00:45:05.072 --> 00:45:09.610
Now let's take a look at updates to SharePlay and Freeform.

1050
00:45:05.072 --> 00:45:09.610
Now let's take a look at updates to SharePlay and Freeform.

1051
00:45:09.643 --> 00:45:12.646
One of SharePlay's best features is screen sharing!

1052
00:45:09.643 --> 00:45:12.646
One of SharePlay's best features is screen sharing!

1053
00:45:12.679 --> 00:45:16.083
It's a great way to help friends and family from afar,

1054
00:45:16.116 --> 00:45:18.719
and we're making it better in two ways.

1055
00:45:18.752 --> 00:45:21.588
Now you can tap and draw on your screen

1056
00:45:21.622 --> 00:45:24.691
to point out what they should do on theirs.

1057
00:45:21.622 --> 00:45:24.691
to point out what they should do on theirs.

1058
00:45:24.725 --> 00:45:28.328
And if you need to assist more directly, you can ask for permission

1059
00:45:28.362 --> 00:45:31.265
to remotely control their iPad or iPhone.

1060
00:45:35.736 --> 00:45:37.671
- Hope that helps.

1061
00:45:37.704 --> 00:45:41.375
Craig: And Freeform adds Scenes, an all-new way

1062
00:45:41.408 --> 00:45:45.646
to select sections of a board to present them one by one.

1063
00:45:41.408 --> 00:45:45.646
to select sections of a board to present them one by one.

1064
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:49.516
Next, I want to talk about a feat that some may have concluded

1065
00:45:45.679 --> 00:45:49.516
Next, I want to talk about a feat that some may have concluded

1066
00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:52.653
must be a mathematical impossibility.

1067
00:45:52.686 --> 00:45:56.757
That's right, we're bringing Calculator to iPad.

1068
00:45:52.686 --> 00:45:56.757
That's right, we're bringing Calculator to iPad.

1069
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:02.429
By leveraging what makes iPad so unique, it makes solving math easier than ever.

1070
00:45:56.790 --> 00:46:02.429
By leveraging what makes iPad so unique, it makes solving math easier than ever.

1071
00:46:02.462 --> 00:46:05.832
It starts with the Calculator that you know from iPhone,

1072
00:46:05.866 --> 00:46:09.269
updated to take advantage of the larger iPad display,

1073
00:46:05.866 --> 00:46:09.269
updated to take advantage of the larger iPad display,

1074
00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:12.973
along with some new tricks like history and unit conversions.

1075
00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:12.973
along with some new tricks like history and unit conversions.

1076
00:46:13.006 --> 00:46:16.076
But the real magic of Calculator on iPad is unlocked

1077
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:20.514
when you use it with your Apple Pencil, an iPad superpower.

1078
00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:20.514
when you use it with your Apple Pencil, an iPad superpower.

1079
00:46:20.547 --> 00:46:23.517
Apple Pencil has changed the way you can take notes,

1080
00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:26.286
draw, and even design with iPad.

1081
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.226
And now, it's changing the way you do math with a feature we call Math Notes.

1082
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:32.226
And now, it's changing the way you do math with a feature we call Math Notes.

1083
00:46:32.259 --> 00:46:34.828
Let's see it in action with Jenny.

1084
00:46:34.862 --> 00:46:39.266
Jenny Chen: I'm so excited to show you the new Math Notes experience.

1085
00:46:34.862 --> 00:46:39.266
Jenny Chen: I'm so excited to show you the new Math Notes experience.

1086
00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:43.537
I get to it by just tapping the new calculator button right here.

1087
00:46:39.299 --> 00:46:43.537
I get to it by just tapping the new calculator button right here.

1088
00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:47.274
And with my Apple Pencil, I'll just start writing out expressions

1089
00:46:47.307 --> 00:46:49.943
like I would on a piece of paper.

1090
00:46:49.977 --> 00:46:54.982
As soon as I write an equals sign, Calculator immediately solves it for me!

1091
00:46:49.977 --> 00:46:54.982
As soon as I write an equals sign, Calculator immediately solves it for me!

1092
00:46:55.015 --> 00:46:58.819
And even shows me the result in handwriting like my own!

1093
00:46:58.852 --> 00:47:03.590
When I make a change, the results update live.

1094
00:46:58.852 --> 00:47:03.590
When I make a change, the results update live.

1095
00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:07.494
And I can go beyond basic math with all of the same functions

1096
00:47:03.624 --> 00:47:07.494
And I can go beyond basic math with all of the same functions

1097
00:47:07.528 --> 00:47:09.830
from the scientific calculator.

1098
00:47:09.863 --> 00:47:13.000
I can save my Math Notes and come back to them later

1099
00:47:09.863 --> 00:47:13.000
I can save my Math Notes and come back to them later

1100
00:47:13.033 --> 00:47:14.768
if I'm working on different things.

1101
00:47:14.801 --> 00:47:16.937
Like here, where I'm working on a budget

1102
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:20.340
for my team's upcoming table tennis tournament.

1103
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:20.340
for my team's upcoming table tennis tournament.

1104
00:47:20.374 --> 00:47:23.477
Since I'm in Math Notes, I can sum these costs quickly

1105
00:47:23.510 --> 00:47:26.246
by just drawing a line underneath them.

1106
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:28.148
It's so natural.

1107
00:47:28.182 --> 00:47:33.387
Math Notes are also really powerful when it comes to more complex math.

1108
00:47:28.182 --> 00:47:33.387
Math Notes are also really powerful when it comes to more complex math.

1109
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.057
Here, I have a physics problem my teammate and I are working on.

1110
00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:37.057
Here, I have a physics problem my teammate and I are working on.

1111
00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:40.360
We're calculating the maximum height of a table tennis ball

1112
00:47:40.394 --> 00:47:43.630
when I hit it with different speeds and angles.

1113
00:47:40.394 --> 00:47:43.630
when I hit it with different speeds and angles.

1114
00:47:43.664 --> 00:47:46.834
Math Notes supports variables, so I've declared a few here,

1115
00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:49.970
and there's an expression below, which uses these variables

1116
00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:49.970
and there's an expression below, which uses these variables

1117
00:47:50.003 --> 00:47:52.706
to help me calculate the height.

1118
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:56.376
What's powerful about variables is that if I change one,

1119
00:47:52.739 --> 00:47:56.376
What's powerful about variables is that if I change one,

1120
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:02.216
like the velocity of my shot, it will change the related results too.

1121
00:47:56.410 --> 00:48:02.216
like the velocity of my shot, it will change the related results too.

1122
00:48:02.249 --> 00:48:06.787
And if I want to see how this speed impacts the height visually, I can.

1123
00:48:02.249 --> 00:48:06.787
And if I want to see how this speed impacts the height visually, I can.

1124
00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.958
I'll just put "y equals" in front of this equation.

1125
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:14.261
And now when I tap the equals sign,

1126
00:48:14.294 --> 00:48:17.431
I have an option to create a graph.

1127
00:48:17.464 --> 00:48:21.768
And if I'm curious how the height will be impacted by the angle of my shot,

1128
00:48:17.464 --> 00:48:21.768
And if I'm curious how the height will be impacted by the angle of my shot,

1129
00:48:21.802 --> 00:48:25.172
I can hover my Pencil over the angle and adjust it

1130
00:48:21.802 --> 00:48:25.172
I can hover my Pencil over the angle and adjust it

1131
00:48:25.205 --> 00:48:28.609
to see how it affects my graph in real time.

1132
00:48:28.642 --> 00:48:31.578
It's an easy way to explore equations in math.

1133
00:48:28.642 --> 00:48:31.578
It's an easy way to explore equations in math.

1134
00:48:31.612 --> 00:48:35.649
And that's just a quick look at Math Notes in Calculator.

1135
00:48:35.682 --> 00:48:37.417
Back to you, Craig.

1136
00:48:37.451 --> 00:48:40.921
Craig: Math Notes are perfect for working through a problem set,

1137
00:48:40.954 --> 00:48:44.491
or just tackling the math we run into day to day.

1138
00:48:40.954 --> 00:48:44.491
or just tackling the math we run into day to day.

1139
00:48:44.525 --> 00:48:46.793
And this all works in Notes too.

1140
00:48:46.827 --> 00:48:48.328
When you need to crunch numbers,

1141
00:48:48.362 --> 00:48:51.865
Notes has all of the new math capabilities from Calculator.

1142
00:48:51.899 --> 00:48:58.038
Just as we've reimagined math on iPad, we've also reimagined handwriting in Notes

1143
00:48:51.899 --> 00:48:58.038
Just as we've reimagined math on iPad, we've also reimagined handwriting in Notes

1144
00:48:58.071 --> 00:49:00.974
with a new feature called Smart Script.

1145
00:49:01.008 --> 00:49:03.443
Notes already has great handwriting features,

1146
00:49:03.477 --> 00:49:06.046
like the ability to select and copy your writing,

1147
00:49:03.477 --> 00:49:06.046
like the ability to select and copy your writing,

1148
00:49:06.079 --> 00:49:07.548
or even make it straighter.

1149
00:49:07.581 --> 00:49:11.752
With Smart Script, we're making handwriting your notes smoother than ever.

1150
00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:16.223
It starts with improving the appearance of your writing, as you write.

1151
00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:16.223
It starts with improving the appearance of your writing, as you write.

1152
00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:19.660
We use a powerful on-device machine learning model

1153
00:49:16.256 --> 00:49:19.660
We use a powerful on-device machine learning model

1154
00:49:19.693 --> 00:49:23.297
to re-create your handwriting style from your notes,

1155
00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.832
which unlocks new capabilities.

1156
00:49:25.866 --> 00:49:28.602
Just scribble your thoughts as fast as you have them

1157
00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:32.506
and Smart Script refines your handwriting as you go.

1158
00:49:28.635 --> 00:49:32.506
and Smart Script refines your handwriting as you go.

1159
00:49:32.539 --> 00:49:37.477
It's still your own writing, but it looks smoother, straighter, and more legible.

1160
00:49:32.539 --> 00:49:37.477
It's still your own writing, but it looks smoother, straighter, and more legible.

1161
00:49:37.511 --> 00:49:40.047
Smart Script further accelerates your writing flow

1162
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.550
by making handwriting just as flexible as typed text.

1163
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:43.550
by making handwriting just as flexible as typed text.

1164
00:49:43.584 --> 00:49:46.920
Now you can just paste typed text into a handwritten note,

1165
00:49:46.954 --> 00:49:49.022
and it will appear in your own style.

1166
00:49:49.056 --> 00:49:53.994
Spell check works just as you would expect and fixes mistakes inline.

1167
00:49:54.027 --> 00:49:56.964
When you decide you need to add to something you've already written,

1168
00:49:56.997 --> 00:49:59.333
just tap and hold with your Apple Pencil

1169
00:49:59.366 --> 00:50:03.303
and your text will flow out of the way to create more space.

1170
00:49:59.366 --> 00:50:03.303
and your text will flow out of the way to create more space.

1171
00:50:03.337 --> 00:50:08.342
If you want to erase something you can just scratch it out.

1172
00:50:03.337 --> 00:50:08.342
If you want to erase something you can just scratch it out.

1173
00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:13.714
Smart Script makes your handwritten notes more effective, fluid, and easier to read.

1174
00:50:08.375 --> 00:50:13.714
Smart Script makes your handwritten notes more effective, fluid, and easier to read.

1175
00:50:13.747 --> 00:50:16.183

01:11:17.544 --> 01:11:22.015
Apple Intelligence can process the relevant personal data to assist me.

1672
01:11:22.049 --> 01:11:25.853
It can understand who my daughter is, the play details she sent

1673
01:11:22.049 --> 01:11:25.853
It can understand who my daughter is, the play details she sent

1674
01:11:25.886 --> 01:11:29.323
several days ago, the time and location for my meeting,

1675
01:11:29.356 --> 01:11:32.960
and predicted traffic between my office and the theater.

1676
01:11:29.356 --> 01:11:32.960
and predicted traffic between my office and the theater.

1677
01:11:32.993 --> 01:11:36.730
Understanding this kind of personal context is essential

1678
01:11:32.993 --> 01:11:36.730
Understanding this kind of personal context is essential

1679
01:11:36.763 --> 01:11:39.967
for delivering truly helpful intelligence.

1680
01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.135
But it has to be done right.

1681
01:11:42.169 --> 01:11:45.806
You should not have to hand over all the details of your life

1682
01:11:45.839 --> 01:11:49.576
to be warehoused and analyzed in someone's AI cloud.

1683
01:11:45.839 --> 01:11:49.576
to be warehoused and analyzed in someone's AI cloud.

1684
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:52.779
With Apple Intelligence, powerful intelligence goes

1685
01:11:52.813 --> 01:11:56.617
hand in hand with powerful privacy.

1686
01:11:56.650 --> 01:11:59.353
Let me tell you more about its architecture,

1687
01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:02.489
and how it is built with privacy at the core.

1688
01:11:59.386 --> 01:12:02.489
and how it is built with privacy at the core.

1689
01:12:02.523 --> 01:12:05.392
The cornerstone of the personal intelligence system

1690
01:12:05.425 --> 01:12:08.061
is on-device processing.

1691
01:12:08.095 --> 01:12:11.498
We have integrated it deep into your iPhone, iPad, and Mac

1692
01:12:11.532 --> 01:12:14.868
and throughout your apps, so it's aware of your personal data,

1693
01:12:11.532 --> 01:12:14.868
and throughout your apps, so it's aware of your personal data,

1694
01:12:14.902 --> 01:12:17.538
without collecting your personal data.

1695
01:12:17.571 --> 01:12:20.574
This is only possible through our unique integration

1696
01:12:17.571 --> 01:12:20.574
This is only possible through our unique integration

1697
01:12:20.607 --> 01:12:24.578
of hardware and software, and our years-long investment

1698
01:12:20.607 --> 01:12:24.578
of hardware and software, and our years-long investment

1699
01:12:24.611 --> 01:12:28.515
in building advanced silicon for on-device intelligence.

1700
01:12:28.549 --> 01:12:32.886
Deeply-integrated generative models require immense processing power.

1701
01:12:28.549 --> 01:12:32.886
Deeply-integrated generative models require immense processing power.

1702
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:38.292
And with our most advanced Apple silicon, the A17 Pro and M-family of chips,

1703
01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:38.292
And with our most advanced Apple silicon, the A17 Pro and M-family of chips,

1704
01:12:38.325 --> 01:12:43.297
we have the computational foundation to power Apple Intelligence.

1705
01:12:38.325 --> 01:12:43.297
we have the computational foundation to power Apple Intelligence.

1706
01:12:43.330 --> 01:12:47.367
This personal intelligence system is comprised of highly-capable large language

1707
01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:51.038
and diffusion models that are specialized for your everyday tasks,

1708
01:12:47.401 --> 01:12:51.038
and diffusion models that are specialized for your everyday tasks,

1709
01:12:51.071 --> 01:12:54.675
and can adapt on the fly to your current activity.

1710
01:12:51.071 --> 01:12:54.675
and can adapt on the fly to your current activity.

1711
01:12:54.708 --> 01:12:58.111
It also includes an on-device semantic index

1712
01:12:58.145 --> 01:13:02.015
that can organize and surface information from across your apps.

1713
01:12:58.145 --> 01:13:02.015
that can organize and surface information from across your apps.

1714
01:13:02.049 --> 01:13:05.953
When you make a request, Apple Intelligence uses its semantic index

1715
01:13:05.986 --> 01:13:10.324
to identify the relevant personal data, and feeds it to the generative models

1716
01:13:05.986 --> 01:13:10.324
to identify the relevant personal data, and feeds it to the generative models

1717
01:13:10.357 --> 01:13:13.660
so they have the personal context to best assist you.

1718
01:13:10.357 --> 01:13:13.660
so they have the personal context to best assist you.

1719
01:13:13.694 --> 01:13:17.331
Many of these models run entirely on-device.

1720
01:13:17.364 --> 01:13:19.833
There are times, though, when you need models

1721
01:13:17.364 --> 01:13:19.833
There are times, though, when you need models

1722
01:13:19.867 --> 01:13:22.903
that are larger than what fits in your pocket today.

1723
01:13:22.936 --> 01:13:24.605
Servers can help with this.

1724
01:13:24.638 --> 01:13:28.108
But traditionally, servers can also store your data

1725
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:32.613
without you realizing it, and use it in ways you did not intend.

1726
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:32.613
without you realizing it, and use it in ways you did not intend.

1727
01:13:32.646 --> 01:13:36.116
And since server software is only accessible to its owners,

1728
01:13:32.646 --> 01:13:36.116
And since server software is only accessible to its owners,

1729
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:38.819
even if a company says it's not misusing your data,

1730
01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:42.856
you are unable to verify their claim, or if it changes over time.

1731
01:13:38.852 --> 01:13:42.856
you are unable to verify their claim, or if it changes over time.

1732
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:46.093
In contrast, when you use an Apple device like your iPhone,

1733
01:13:46.126 --> 01:13:51.198
you are in control of your data, where it is stored, and who can access it.

1734
01:13:46.126 --> 01:13:51.198
you are in control of your data, where it is stored, and who can access it.

1735
01:13:51.231 --> 01:13:54.568
And because the software image for your iPhone is accessible

1736
01:13:51.231 --> 01:13:54.568
And because the software image for your iPhone is accessible

1737
01:13:54.601 --> 01:13:59.206
to independent experts, they can continuously verify its privacy.

1738
01:13:59.239 --> 01:14:02.876
We want to extend the privacy and security of your iPhone

1739
01:13:59.239 --> 01:14:02.876
We want to extend the privacy and security of your iPhone

1740
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:07.147
into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence for you.

1741
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:07.147
into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence for you.

1742
01:14:07.181 --> 01:14:11.685
So we have created Private Cloud Compute.

1743
01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:15.422
Private Cloud Compute allows Apple Intelligence to flex

1744
01:14:11.718 --> 01:14:15.422
Private Cloud Compute allows Apple Intelligence to flex

1745
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:19.927
and scale its computational capacity, and draw on even larger,

1746
01:14:15.455 --> 01:14:19.927
and scale its computational capacity, and draw on even larger,

1747
01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:22.930
server-based models for more complex requests,

1748
01:14:22.963 --> 01:14:25.199
while protecting your privacy.

1749
01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:30.270
These models run on servers we have especially created using Apple silicon.

1750
01:14:25.232 --> 01:14:30.270
These models run on servers we have especially created using Apple silicon.

1751
01:14:30.304 --> 01:14:33.507
These Apple silicon servers offer the privacy and security

1752
01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:36.777
of your iPhone from the silicon on up,

1753
01:14:36.810 --> 01:14:40.347
draw on the security properties of the Swift programming language,

1754
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.017
and run software with transparency built in.

1755
01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:44.017
and run software with transparency built in.

1756
01:14:44.051 --> 01:14:47.387
When you make a request, Apple Intelligence analyzes

1757
01:14:47.421 --> 01:14:49.523
whether it can be processed on-device.

1758
01:14:49.556 --> 01:14:51.992
If it needs greater computational capacity,

1759
01:14:52.025 --> 01:14:56.797
it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, and send only the data that's relevant

1760
01:14:52.025 --> 01:14:56.797
it can draw on Private Cloud Compute, and send only the data that's relevant

1761
01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:59.933
to your task to be processed on Apple silicon servers.

1762
01:14:59.967 --> 01:15:04.371
Your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple.

1763
01:14:59.967 --> 01:15:04.371
Your data is never stored or made accessible to Apple.

1764
01:15:04.404 --> 01:15:07.474
It's used exclusively to fulfill your request.

1765
01:15:04.404 --> 01:15:07.474
It's used exclusively to fulfill your request.

1766
01:15:07.508 --> 01:15:11.912
And just like your iPhone, independent experts can inspect

1767
01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:16.250
the code that runs on these servers to verify this privacy promise.

1768
01:15:11.945 --> 01:15:16.250
the code that runs on these servers to verify this privacy promise.

1769
01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:20.821
In fact, Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures

1770
01:15:16.283 --> 01:15:20.821
In fact, Private Cloud Compute cryptographically ensures

1771
01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:24.625
your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will refuse to talk to a server

1772
01:15:20.854 --> 01:15:24.625
your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will refuse to talk to a server

1773
01:15:24.658 --> 01:15:28.295
unless its software has been publicly logged for inspection.

1774
01:15:28.328 --> 01:15:32.399
This sets a brand-new standard for privacy in AI,

1775
01:15:28.328 --> 01:15:32.399
This sets a brand-new standard for privacy in AI,

1776
01:15:32.432 --> 01:15:35.702
and unlocks intelligence you can trust.

1777
01:15:35.736 --> 01:15:39.072
So that's a look at the powerful capabilities

1778
01:15:35.736 --> 01:15:39.072
So that's a look at the powerful capabilities

1779
01:15:39.106 --> 01:15:43.310
of Apple Intelligence and its groundbreaking privacy protections.

1780
01:15:39.106 --> 01:15:43.310
of Apple Intelligence and its groundbreaking privacy protections.

1781
01:15:43.343 --> 01:15:46.813
Now we'd love to show you how it will transform your apps

1782
01:15:46.847 --> 01:15:52.953
and experiences across iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia,

1783
01:15:46.847 --> 01:15:52.953
and experiences across iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia,

1784
01:15:52.986 --> 01:15:56.456
from a big leap forward for Siri, to powerful tools

1785
01:15:52.986 --> 01:15:56.456
from a big leap forward for Siri, to powerful tools

1786
01:15:56.490 --> 01:15:57.991
for writing and communication,

1787
01:15:58.025 --> 01:16:01.161
and fun visual ways to express yourself.

1788
01:16:01.195 --> 01:16:05.332
Let's start with Siri. Here's Kelsey to tell you more.

1789
01:16:06.633 --> 01:16:10.904
Kelsey Peterson: Today, Siri helps you get everyday tasks done quickly and easily.

1790
01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:16.243
In fact, Siri users make 1.5 billion voice requests every single day.

1791
01:16:10.938 --> 01:16:16.243
In fact, Siri users make 1.5 billion voice requests every single day.

1792
01:16:16.276 --> 01:16:19.313
Thirteen years ago, we introduced Siri.

1793
01:16:19.346 --> 01:16:22.049
The original intelligent assistant.

1794
01:16:22.082 --> 01:16:24.484
And we had an ambitious vision for it.

1795
01:16:24.518 --> 01:16:27.421
We've been steadily building towards that vision.

1796
01:16:27.454 --> 01:16:31.358
And now, thanks to the incredible power of Apple Intelligence,

1797
01:16:27.454 --> 01:16:31.358
And now, thanks to the incredible power of Apple Intelligence,

1798
01:16:31.391 --> 01:16:35.262
we have the foundational capabilities to take a major step forward.

1799
01:16:35.295 --> 01:16:40.033
So we can make Siri more natural, more contextually relevant,

1800
01:16:35.295 --> 01:16:40.033
So we can make Siri more natural, more contextually relevant,

1801
01:16:40.067 --> 01:16:42.803
and of course, more personal to you.

1802
01:16:42.836 --> 01:16:45.639
Right off the bat, you'll see Siri's got a new look.

1803
01:16:45.672 --> 01:16:48.041
Let me show you.

1804
01:16:48.075 --> 01:16:51.245
When you talk to Siri, you'll notice it's more deeply integrated

1805
01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:54.615
into the system experience, with this elegant glowing light

1806
01:16:51.278 --> 01:16:54.615
into the system experience, with this elegant glowing light

1807
01:16:54.648 --> 01:16:56.650
that wraps around the edge of your screen.

1808
01:16:56.683 --> 01:16:59.453
And you can speak to Siri more naturally

1809
01:16:59.486 --> 01:17:02.422
thanks to richer language understanding capabilities.

1810
01:16:59.486 --> 01:17:02.422
thanks to richer language understanding capabilities.

1811
01:17:02.456 --> 01:17:05.993
Even if I stumble over my words, Siri understands what I'm getting at.

1812
01:17:06.026 --> 01:17:09.763
What does the weather look like for tomorrow at Muir Beach?

1813
01:17:13.267 --> 01:17:15.969
Siri: The forecast is calling for clear skies in the morning

1814
01:17:16.003 --> 01:17:18.372
near Muir Woods National Monument.

1815
01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:19.940
Kelsey: Sometimes it takes me a beat

1816
01:17:19.973 --> 01:17:22.376
to figure out what I actually want to ask Siri,

1817
01:17:22.409 --> 01:17:25.512
and now it follows right along.

1818
01:17:25.546 --> 01:17:28.248
Siri also maintains conversational context,

1819
01:17:28.282 --> 01:17:29.883
so I can follow up and say,

1820
01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:33.554
"Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9:00 a.m."

1821
01:17:29.917 --> 01:17:33.554
"Create an event for a hike there tomorrow at 9:00 a.m."

1822
01:17:35.489 --> 01:17:39.693
Siri: Hike is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on June 11.

1823
01:17:35.489 --> 01:17:39.693
Siri: Hike is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. on June 11.

1824
01:17:39.726 --> 01:17:42.262
Kelsey: I didn't have to mention Muir Woods again.

1825
01:17:39.726 --> 01:17:42.262
Kelsey: I didn't have to mention Muir Woods again.

1826
01:17:42.296 --> 01:17:44.565
Siri understood what I meant when I said "there."

1827
01:17:44.598 --> 01:17:47.601
There are also certain times when you might not want

1828
01:17:47.634 --> 01:17:49.536
to speak to Siri out loud.

1829
01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:55.375
What's great is that now, at any time, you have the option to type to Siri.

1830
01:17:49.570 --> 01:17:55.375
What's great is that now, at any time, you have the option to type to Siri.

1831
01:17:55.409 --> 01:17:58.679
With just a double tap at the bottom of the screen,

1832
01:17:58.712 --> 01:18:02.382
I can quickly and quietly ask Siri to set an alarm.

1833
01:17:58.712 --> 01:18:02.382
I can quickly and quietly ask Siri to set an alarm.

1834
01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:06.720
And you can switch between text and voice,

1835
01:18:06.753 --> 01:18:09.656
communicating in whatever way feels right for the moment.

1836
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.993
We're also laying the groundwork for some brand-new ways

1837
01:18:09.690 --> 01:18:12.993
We're also laying the groundwork for some brand-new ways

1838
01:18:13.026 --> 01:18:15.662
that Siri will be able to support you,

1839
01:18:15.696 --> 01:18:19.132
one of which is its extensive product knowledge.

1840
01:18:15.696 --> 01:18:19.132
one of which is its extensive product knowledge.

1841
01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:24.304
Siri now holds a great deal of information about features and settings

1842
01:18:19.166 --> 01:18:24.304
Siri now holds a great deal of information about features and settings

1843
01:18:24.338 --> 01:18:27.174
and can answer thousands of questions when you want to know

1844
01:18:27.207 --> 01:18:31.645
how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

1845
01:18:27.207 --> 01:18:31.645
how to do something on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.

1846
01:18:31.678 --> 01:18:34.848
Even if you don't know exactly what a feature is called,

1847
01:18:34.882 --> 01:18:36.416
you can just describe it

1848
01:18:36.450 --> 01:18:38.852
and Siri will find the info you're looking for.

1849
01:18:38.886 --> 01:18:44.124
Like this: "How can I write a message now and have it be delivered tomorrow?"

1850
01:18:38.886 --> 01:18:44.124
Like this: "How can I write a message now and have it be delivered tomorrow?"

1851
01:18:44.157 --> 01:18:46.126
Siri understood what feature I was referring to,

1852
01:18:46.159 --> 01:18:47.895
and now I have step-by-step guidance

1853
01:18:47.928 --> 01:18:50.964
on how to use the new Send Later feature in Messages.

1854
01:18:47.928 --> 01:18:50.964
on how to use the new Send Later feature in Messages.

1855
01:18:50.998 --> 01:18:53.600
Everything I've showed you so far will be available

1856
01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:56.370
from the moment you start using Apple Intelligence.

1857
01:18:53.634 --> 01:18:56.370
from the moment you start using Apple Intelligence.

1858
01:18:56.403 --> 01:18:58.872
And over the course of the next year, we will be rolling out

1859
01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:02.643
more features that make Siri even more personal and capable.

1860
01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:02.643
more features that make Siri even more personal and capable.

1861
01:19:02.676 --> 01:19:07.080
For one, Apple Intelligence will provide Siri with on-screen awareness,

1862
01:19:02.676 --> 01:19:07.080
For one, Apple Intelligence will provide Siri with on-screen awareness,

1863
01:19:07.114 --> 01:19:09.716
so it'll be able to understand and take action

1864
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:11.718
with things on your screen.

1865
01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:14.254
For example, say a friend texts you his new address.

1866
01:19:11.752 --> 01:19:14.254
For example, say a friend texts you his new address.

1867
01:19:14.288 --> 01:19:17.124
Right from the Messages thread, you can say,

1868
01:19:17.157 --> 01:19:22.696
"Add this address to his contact card," and Siri will take care of it.

1869
01:19:17.157 --> 01:19:22.696
"Add this address to his contact card," and Siri will take care of it.

1870
01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:27.201
Siri will also understand more of the things you get done in your apps.

1871
01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:27.201
Siri will also understand more of the things you get done in your apps.

1872
01:19:27.234 --> 01:19:31.104
And with new orchestration capabilities provided by Apple Intelligence,

1873
01:19:27.234 --> 01:19:31.104
And with new orchestration capabilities provided by Apple Intelligence,

1874
01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:35.075
Siri will take actions inside apps on your behalf.

1875
01:19:35.108 --> 01:19:38.879
Siri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions

1876
01:19:35.108 --> 01:19:38.879
Siri will have the ability to take hundreds of new actions

1877
01:19:38.912 --> 01:19:42.049
in and across apps, including some that leverage

1878
01:19:38.912 --> 01:19:42.049
in and across apps, including some that leverage

1879
01:19:42.082 --> 01:19:45.252
our new writing and image generation capabilities.

1880
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:49.289
For example, you'll be able to say, "Show me my photos of Stacey

1881
01:19:45.285 --> 01:19:49.289
For example, you'll be able to say, "Show me my photos of Stacey

1882
01:19:49.323 --> 01:19:53.727
in New York wearing her pink coat," and Siri will bring those right up.

1883
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:59.600
Then you might say, "Make this photo pop," and Siri will enhance it, just like that.

1884
01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:59.600
Then you might say, "Make this photo pop," and Siri will enhance it, just like that.

1885
01:19:59.633 --> 01:20:03.403
And Siri will be able to take actions across apps,

1886
01:19:59.633 --> 01:20:03.403
And Siri will be able to take actions across apps,

1887
01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:06.974
so you could say, "Add this to my note with Stacey's bio,"

1888
01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:06.974
so you could say, "Add this to my note with Stacey's bio,"

1889
01:20:07.007 --> 01:20:10.711
and it will jump from the Photos app to the Notes app to make it happen.

1890
01:20:10.744 --> 01:20:14.081
This is going to bring us closer to realizing our vision

1891
01:20:10.744 --> 01:20:14.081
This is going to bring us closer to realizing our vision

1892
01:20:14.114 --> 01:20:18.285
in which Siri moves through the system in concert with you.

1893
01:20:14.114 --> 01:20:18.285
in which Siri moves through the system in concert with you.

1894
01:20:18.318 --> 01:20:21.288
This is made possible through significant enhancements

1895
01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:25.058
that we are making to App Intents, a framework that lets apps define

1896
01:20:21.321 --> 01:20:25.058
that we are making to App Intents, a framework that lets apps define

1897
01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:30.297
a set of actions for Siri, Shortcuts, and other system experiences.

1898
01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:30.297
a set of actions for Siri, Shortcuts, and other system experiences.

1899
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:34.535
And this won't be limited to apps made by Apple.

1900
01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:38.038
For developers, they'll be able to use the App Intents framework

1901
01:20:34.568 --> 01:20:38.038
For developers, they'll be able to use the App Intents framework

1902
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:42.609
to define actions in their apps and tap into Apple Intelligence too.

1903
01:20:38.071 --> 01:20:42.609
to define actions in their apps and tap into Apple Intelligence too.

1904
01:20:42.643 --> 01:20:45.345
So you might ask Siri to take a light trails video

1905
01:20:45.379 --> 01:20:47.314
in Pro Camera by Moment.

1906
01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:49.783
Or ask Siri to share a summary of your meeting notes

1907
01:20:47.347 --> 01:20:49.783
Or ask Siri to share a summary of your meeting notes

1908
01:20:49.816 --> 01:20:52.786
in an email you're drafting to a teammate in Superhuman.

1909
01:20:52.819 --> 01:20:55.055
And this is only the beginning.

1910
01:20:55.088 --> 01:20:57.057
Siri will be able to understand

1911
01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:00.994
and take more actions in more apps over time.

1912
01:20:57.090 --> 01:21:00.994
and take more actions in more apps over time.

1913
01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:06.600
There's one more set of really cool and useful capabilities coming to Siri.

1914
01:21:01.028 --> 01:21:06.600
There's one more set of really cool and useful capabilities coming to Siri.

1915
01:21:06.633 --> 01:21:11.305
Thanks to Apple Intelligence, it has awareness of your personal context.

1916
01:21:11.338 --> 01:21:15.075
With its semantic index of things like photos, calendar events,

1917
01:21:11.338 --> 01:21:15.075
With its semantic index of things like photos, calendar events,

1918
01:21:15.108 --> 01:21:18.111
and files, plus information that's stashed

1919
01:21:18.145 --> 01:21:21.615
in passing messages and emails, like hotel bookings,

1920
01:21:21.648 --> 01:21:25.219
PDFs of concert tickets, and links that your friends have shared,

1921
01:21:21.648 --> 01:21:25.219
PDFs of concert tickets, and links that your friends have shared,

1922
01:21:25.252 --> 01:21:30.057
Siri will find and understand things it never could before.

1923
01:21:25.252 --> 01:21:30.057
Siri will find and understand things it never could before.

1924
01:21:30.090 --> 01:21:33.994
And with the powerful privacy protections of Apple Intelligence,

1925
01:21:34.027 --> 01:21:37.064
Siri will use this information to help you get things done

1926
01:21:34.027 --> 01:21:37.064
Siri will use this information to help you get things done

1927
01:21:37.097 --> 01:21:40.901
without compromising your privacy.

1928
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.103
You'll be able to ask Siri to find something

1929
01:21:40.934 --> 01:21:43.103
You'll be able to ask Siri to find something

1930
01:21:43.136 --> 01:21:47.140
when you can't remember if it was in an email, a text, or a shared note,

1931
01:21:47.174 --> 01:21:50.544
like some book recommendations that a friend sent you a while back.

1932
01:21:47.174 --> 01:21:50.544
like some book recommendations that a friend sent you a while back.

1933
01:21:50.577 --> 01:21:53.213
Or for times when you're filling out a form

1934
01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:56.717
and need to input your driver's license, Siri will be able to find

1935
01:21:53.247 --> 01:21:56.717
and need to input your driver's license, Siri will be able to find

1936
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:59.419
a photo of your license, extract your ID number,

1937
01:21:59.453 --> 01:22:02.322
and type it into the form for you.

1938
01:22:02.356 --> 01:22:05.826
I want to show you one more demo that will give you a sense

1939
01:22:05.859 --> 01:22:07.928
for how powerful Siri will be

1940
01:22:07.961 --> 01:22:10.097
when it draws on the personal context awareness

1941
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:14.501
and action capabilities built into Apple Intelligence.

1942
01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:14.501
and action capabilities built into Apple Intelligence.

1943
01:22:14.535 --> 01:22:17.971
Imagine that I am planning to pick my mom up from the airport,

1944
01:22:18.005 --> 01:22:20.407
and I'm trying to figure out my timing.

1945
01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.644
Siri is going to be able to help me do this so easily.

1946
01:22:23.677 --> 01:22:27.014
Siri, when is my mom's flight landing?

1947
01:22:27.047 --> 01:22:29.383
What's awesome is that Siri actually cross-references

1948
01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:31.752
flight details that my mom shared with me by email

1949
01:22:29.416 --> 01:22:31.752
flight details that my mom shared with me by email

1950
01:22:31.785 --> 01:22:36.190
with real-time flight tracking to give me her up-to-date arrival time.

1951
01:22:31.785 --> 01:22:36.190
with real-time flight tracking to give me her up-to-date arrival time.

1952
01:22:36.223 --> 01:22:37.958
What's our lunch plan?

1953
01:22:37.991 --> 01:22:40.427
I don't always remember to add things to my calendar,

1954
01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.530
and so I love that Siri can help me keep track of plans that I've made

1955
01:22:40.460 --> 01:22:43.530
and so I love that Siri can help me keep track of plans that I've made

1956
01:22:43.564 --> 01:22:46.733
in casual conversation, like this lunch reservation

1957
01:22:46.767 --> 01:22:48.735
my mom mentioned in a text.

1958
01:22:48.769 --> 01:22:52.105
How long will it take us to get there from the airport?

1959
01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:55.142
I haven't had to jump from Mail to Messages to Maps

1960
01:22:52.139 --> 01:22:55.142
I haven't had to jump from Mail to Messages to Maps

1961
01:22:55.175 --> 01:22:56.677
to figure out this plan.

1962
01:22:56.710 --> 01:22:59.479
And a set of tasks that would have taken minutes on my own

1963
01:22:59.513 --> 01:23:02.850
and honestly probably would have resulted in a call to my Mom

1964
01:22:59.513 --> 01:23:02.850
and honestly probably would have resulted in a call to my Mom

1965
01:23:02.883 --> 01:23:06.053
could be addressed in a matter of seconds.

1966
01:23:06.086 --> 01:23:09.156
That's just a glimpse of the ways in which Siri is going to become

1967
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:13.527
more powerful and more personal thanks to Apple Intelligence.

1968
01:23:09.189 --> 01:23:13.527
more powerful and more personal thanks to Apple Intelligence.

1969
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.298
And all of these updates to Siri are also coming to iPad and Mac,

1970
01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:18.298
And all of these updates to Siri are also coming to iPad and Mac,

1971
01:23:18.332 --> 01:23:21.768
where Siri's new design is a total game-changer.

1972
01:23:21.802 --> 01:23:25.239
It makes Siri feel seamlessly integrated with your workflow.

1973
01:23:21.802 --> 01:23:25.239
It makes Siri feel seamlessly integrated with your workflow.

1974
01:23:25.272 --> 01:23:28.075
Thanks to the capabilities of Apple Intelligence,

1975
01:23:28.108 --> 01:23:31.345
this year marks the start of a new era for Siri.

1976
01:23:28.108 --> 01:23:31.345
this year marks the start of a new era for Siri.

1977
01:23:31.378 --> 01:23:34.948
Here's Justin to show you more places throughout the system

1978
01:23:34.982 --> 01:23:38.886
where Apple Intelligence simplifies and accelerates your tasks.

1979
01:23:34.982 --> 01:23:38.886
where Apple Intelligence simplifies and accelerates your tasks.

Justin Titi: Apple Intelligence unlocks incredible new ways

1982
01:23:43.357 --> 01:23:45.659
to enhance your writing, whether you are tidying up

1983
01:23:45.692 --> 01:23:48.829
your hastily-written class notes, ensuring your blog post reads

1984
01:23:45.692 --> 01:23:48.829
your hastily-written class notes, ensuring your blog post reads

1985
01:23:48.862 --> 01:23:53.534
just right on Wordpress, or making sure your email is perfectly crafted.

1986
01:23:53.567 --> 01:23:56.904
Let's use Mail to take a closer look at how the systemwide Writing Tools

1987
01:23:53.567 --> 01:23:56.904
Let's use Mail to take a closer look at how the systemwide Writing Tools

1988
01:23:56.937 --> 01:23:59.973
can help you communicate even more effectively.

1989
01:24:00.007 --> 01:24:02.976
Rewrite gives you different versions of what you have written,

1990
01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:14.688
This is great for making sure your cover letter for that job

1991
01:24:14.721 --> 01:24:18.125
you're excited for lands perfectly.

1992
01:24:18.158 --> 01:24:20.961
And suggestions are shown inline, so you can go

1993
01:24:20.994 --> 01:24:24.598
with the combination of flow and wording that works for you.

1994
01:24:20.994 --> 01:24:24.598
with the combination of flow and wording that works for you.

1995
01:24:24.631 --> 01:24:27.401
Rewrite also helps you get the tone right.

1996
01:24:27.434 --> 01:24:29.570
Have you ever re-read a work email that you just wrote

1997
01:24:29.603 --> 01:24:32.139
and thought, "Oh, this might not go over well"?

1998
01:24:29.603 --> 01:24:32.139
and thought, "Oh, this might not go over well"?

1999
01:24:32.172 --> 01:24:35.909
Well, now you can change the tone of that response to your colleague

2000
01:24:35.943 --> 01:24:40.380
to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise.

2001
01:24:35.943 --> 01:24:40.380
to make it sound more friendly, professional, or concise.

2002
01:24:40.414 --> 01:24:43.283
You can also describe how you'd like it rewritten.

2003
01:24:40.414 --> 01:24:43.283
You can also describe how you'd like it rewritten.

2004
01:24:43.317 --> 01:24:45.953
For example, you can invite your friends to a get-together

2005
01:24:45.986 --> 01:24:49.056
with a one-of-a-kind invitation written as a poem.

2006
01:24:45.986 --> 01:24:49.056
with a one-of-a-kind invitation written as a poem.

2007
01:24:49.089 --> 01:24:51.258
Who could say no to that?

2008
01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:54.294
Another way Writing Tools can help you is with Proofread.

2009
01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:54.294
Another way Writing Tools can help you is with Proofread.

2010
01:24:54.328 --> 01:24:56.463
Say you're emailing your English professor.

2011
01:24:56.496 --> 01:24:59.266
With Proofread, you can nail grammar, word choice,

2012
01:24:59.299 --> 01:25:03.337
and sentence structure to put your best foot forward.

2013
01:24:59.299 --> 01:25:03.337
and sentence structure to put your best foot forward.

2014
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.574
You can review suggested edits and their explanations individually,

2015
01:25:03.370 --> 01:25:07.574
You can review suggested edits and their explanations individually,

2016
01:25:07.608 --> 01:25:09.710
or accept them all with a click.

2017
01:25:09.743 --> 01:25:11.812
And if you are about to email a project status

2018
01:25:11.845 --> 01:25:13.347
that has gotten quite long,

2019
01:25:13.380 --> 01:25:17.284
use Summarize to bring out the key points,

2020
01:25:17.317 --> 01:25:20.654
and then add them as a TL;DR right at the top.

2021
01:25:17.317 --> 01:25:20.654
and then add them as a TL;DR right at the top.

2022
01:25:20.687 --> 01:25:24.892
In addition to Mail, you can access Writing Tools systemwide,

2023
01:25:20.687 --> 01:25:24.892
In addition to Mail, you can access Writing Tools systemwide,

2024
01:25:24.925 --> 01:25:28.562
nearly everywhere you write, including third-party apps.

2025
01:25:28.595 --> 01:25:32.733
Apple Intelligence also powers Smart Reply in Mail.

2026
01:25:28.595 --> 01:25:32.733
Apple Intelligence also powers Smart Reply in Mail.

2027
01:25:32.766 --> 01:25:35.702
For example, when you need to RSVP to an event,

2028
01:25:35.736 --> 01:25:39.473
you will now see suggestions for your response based on the email.

2029
01:25:35.736 --> 01:25:39.473
you will now see suggestions for your response based on the email.

2030
01:25:39.506 --> 01:25:42.242
If you say you'll be there, Mail identifies questions

2031
01:25:39.506 --> 01:25:42.242
If you say you'll be there, Mail identifies questions

2032
01:25:42.276 --> 01:25:45.445
you were asked in the invite, and offers intelligent selections

2033
01:25:45.479 --> 01:25:47.814
so you can quickly choose your responses.

2034
01:25:47.848 --> 01:25:50.784
Your drafted response incorporates your answers.

2035
01:25:47.848 --> 01:25:50.784
Your drafted response incorporates your answers.

2036
01:25:50.817 --> 01:25:53.453
So with just a few taps, you're ready to send it off

2037
01:25:53.487 --> 01:25:55.489
with all the right details.

2038
01:25:55.522 --> 01:25:57.958
Finally, let's talk about how Apple Intelligence

2039
01:25:57.991 --> 01:26:00.360
helps you stay on top of a busy inbox.

2040
01:26:00.394 --> 01:26:05.132
We all deal with sorting through a ton of email every day.

2041
01:26:05.165 --> 01:26:09.536
And now it is easier and faster than ever to browse your inbox.

2042
01:26:05.165 --> 01:26:09.536
And now it is easier and faster than ever to browse your inbox.

2043
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:13.574
Instead of previewing the first few lines of each email that don't always convey

2044
01:26:09.570 --> 01:26:13.574
Instead of previewing the first few lines of each email that don't always convey

2045
01:26:13.607 --> 01:26:16.243
the most useful information, you can now see summaries,

2046
01:26:16.276 --> 01:26:18.879
visible right from your email list.

2047
01:26:18.912 --> 01:26:22.282
So without even opening the email, you'll know that your team is

2048
01:26:22.316 --> 01:26:24.618
meeting on Thursday to discuss a new design.

2049
01:26:22.316 --> 01:26:24.618
meeting on Thursday to discuss a new design.

2050
01:26:24.651 --> 01:26:27.988
And if you jump into a particularly long email when you're in a hurry,

2051
01:26:28.021 --> 01:26:30.824
you can tap to reveal a summary at the top of the email

2052
01:26:28.021 --> 01:26:30.824
you can tap to reveal a summary at the top of the email

2053
01:26:30.858 --> 01:26:33.393
and cut right to the chase.

2054
01:26:33.427 --> 01:26:36.463
We're also elevating Priority Messages.

2055
01:26:36.496 --> 01:26:40.100
Apple Intelligence can understand the content of the emails you receive,

2056
01:26:40.133 --> 01:26:44.471
determine what's most urgent, and surface it right at the top.

2057
01:26:40.133 --> 01:26:44.471
determine what's most urgent, and surface it right at the top.

2058
01:26:44.505 --> 01:26:46.273
Like a dinner invite for tonight,

2059
01:26:46.306 --> 01:26:49.376
or a boarding pass for your trip this afternoon.

2060
01:26:46.306 --> 01:26:49.376
or a boarding pass for your trip this afternoon.

2061
01:26:49.409 --> 01:26:54.915
And deep understanding of language extends beyond your inbox into more places,

2062
01:26:49.409 --> 01:26:54.915
And deep understanding of language extends beyond your inbox into more places,

2063
01:26:54.948 --> 01:26:56.483
like your Notifications.

2064
01:26:56.517 --> 01:26:59.753
First, just like in Mail, your Priority Notifications appear

2065
01:26:59.786 --> 01:27:04.691
at the top of the stack, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance.

2066
01:26:59.786 --> 01:27:04.691
at the top of the stack, letting you know what to pay attention to at a glance.

2067
01:27:04.725 --> 01:27:06.860
And to make scanning your notifications faster,

2068
01:27:04.725 --> 01:27:06.860
And to make scanning your notifications faster,

2069
01:27:06.894 --> 01:27:08.996
they're summarized.

2070
01:27:09.029 --> 01:27:12.533
So when the group chat is blowing up, you can quickly see

2071
01:27:09.029 --> 01:27:12.533
So when the group chat is blowing up, you can quickly see

2072
01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:15.602
that Savita booked the house and Lia is arriving early,

2073
01:27:15.636 --> 01:27:17.271
right from your Lock Screen.

2074
01:27:17.304 --> 01:27:20.874
Apple Intelligence also enables an all-new Focus

2075
01:27:17.304 --> 01:27:20.874
Apple Intelligence also enables an all-new Focus

2076
01:27:20.908 --> 01:27:23.010
called Reduce Interruptions.

2077
01:27:23.043 --> 01:27:25.546
It understands the content of your notifications

2078
01:27:23.043 --> 01:27:25.546
It understands the content of your notifications

2079
01:27:25.579 --> 01:27:28.615
to selectively surface only the ones that might need

2080
01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:31.852
immediate attention, like a text about today's daycare pickup.

2081
01:27:28.649 --> 01:27:31.852
immediate attention, like a text about today's daycare pickup.

2082
01:27:31.885 --> 01:27:34.021
From catching up on Priority Notifications,

2083
01:27:34.054 --> 01:27:37.057
to staying present and focused with Reduce Interruptions,

2084
01:27:34.054 --> 01:27:37.057
to staying present and focused with Reduce Interruptions,

2085
01:27:37.090 --> 01:27:39.493
and refining your words with Writing Tools,

2086
01:27:39.526 --> 01:27:43.163
Apple Intelligence helps you save time in so many ways.

2087
01:27:39.526 --> 01:27:43.163
Apple Intelligence helps you save time in so many ways.

2088
01:27:43.197 --> 01:27:47.801
Now, over to Cyrus to show you how it unlocks new ways to express yourself.

2089
01:27:49.903 --> 01:27:52.306
Cyrus Irani: Apple Intelligence enables you to create fun,

2090
01:27:52.339 --> 01:27:56.009
original images whether you are sprucing up a Keynote for class

2091
01:27:52.339 --> 01:27:56.009
original images whether you are sprucing up a Keynote for class

2092
01:27:56.043 --> 01:27:59.780
or trying to land an idea while collaborating in Freeform.

2093
01:27:59.813 --> 01:28:03.217
And third-party apps can offer this experience too, like in Craft,

2094
01:27:59.813 --> 01:28:03.217
And third-party apps can offer this experience too, like in Craft,

2095
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:06.854
where you can create a delightful image to add to your document.

2096
01:28:03.250 --> 01:28:06.854
where you can create a delightful image to add to your document.

2097
01:28:06.887 --> 01:28:09.489
Let's take a closer look at how Apple Intelligence

2098
01:28:09.523 --> 01:28:13.160
helps you express yourself visually in Messages.

2099
01:28:09.523 --> 01:28:13.160
helps you express yourself visually in Messages.

2100
01:28:13.193 --> 01:28:17.831
One of the most fun ways to communicate in Messages is with emoji.

2101
01:28:17.865 --> 01:28:20.834
But even with thousands of emoji to choose from,

2102
01:28:17.865 --> 01:28:20.834
But even with thousands of emoji to choose from,

2103
01:28:20.868 --> 01:28:24.905
there are times when you can't quite find the right one for how you feel.

2104
01:28:20.868 --> 01:28:24.905
there are times when you can't quite find the right one for how you feel.

2105
01:28:24.938 --> 01:28:28.308
So we're introducing Genmoji.

2106
01:28:28.342 --> 01:28:30.744
Leveraging the power of Apple Intelligence,

2107
01:28:28.342 --> 01:28:30.744
Leveraging the power of Apple Intelligence,

2108
01:28:30.777 --> 01:28:33.347
you can create Genmoji, on-device,

2109
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.117
right in the Keyboard, and match any moment perfectly.

2110
01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.117
right in the Keyboard, and match any moment perfectly.

2111
01:28:37.150 --> 01:28:40.387
Just provide a description and you'll see your Genmoji appear

2112
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.524
right before your eyes, along with more options to choose from.

2113
01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.524
right before your eyes, along with more options to choose from.

2114
01:28:43.557 --> 01:28:45.926
This is great in those times when you're updating a friend

2115
01:28:45.959 --> 01:28:47.761
about your relaxing weekend,

2116
01:28:47.794 --> 01:28:50.297
getting the group chat excited about brunch,

2117
01:28:47.794 --> 01:28:50.297
getting the group chat excited about brunch,

2118
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:54.234
or complaining about the rowdy squirrel right outside your window.

2119
01:28:50.330 --> 01:28:54.234
or complaining about the rowdy squirrel right outside your window.

2120
01:28:54.268 --> 01:28:58.605
And because Apple Intelligence is aware of who's in your photo library,

2121
01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:02.643
you can simply pick someone and create a Genmoji that looks just like them!

2122
01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:02.643
you can simply pick someone and create a Genmoji that looks just like them!

2123
01:29:02.676 --> 01:29:05.412
These are perfect for sharing with friends as a sticker,

2124
01:29:05.445 --> 01:29:09.616
reacting to messages with a Tapback, and you can even add Genmoji

2125
01:29:05.445 --> 01:29:09.616
reacting to messages with a Tapback, and you can even add Genmoji

2126
01:29:09.650 --> 01:29:11.351
inline in your messages!

2127
01:29:11.385 --> 01:29:17.090
Let your imagination run wild as you create just the right Genmoji!

2128
01:29:11.385 --> 01:29:17.090
Let your imagination run wild as you create just the right Genmoji!

2129
01:29:17.124 --> 01:29:20.861
And because it's so much fun to use images to express ourselves,

2130
01:29:17.124 --> 01:29:20.861
And because it's so much fun to use images to express ourselves,

2131
01:29:20.894 --> 01:29:23.764
we went even further with a new system experience

2132
01:29:23.797 --> 01:29:26.700
we call Image Playground.

2133
01:29:26.733 --> 01:29:30.637
This is a new way to create playful images in just seconds.

2134
01:29:26.733 --> 01:29:30.637
This is a new way to create playful images in just seconds.

2135
01:29:30.671 --> 01:29:35.375
It's so easy to use, and we've built it right into apps like Messages.

2136
01:29:35.409 --> 01:29:38.545
To get started, you can choose from a range of concepts

2137
01:29:35.409 --> 01:29:38.545
To get started, you can choose from a range of concepts

2138
01:29:38.579 --> 01:29:43.283
like themes, costumes, accessories,

2139
01:29:43.317 --> 01:29:46.320
places, and more.

2140
01:29:46.353 --> 01:29:49.056
When you select them, they get added to your playground.

2141
01:29:46.353 --> 01:29:49.056
When you select them, they get added to your playground.

2142
01:29:49.089 --> 01:29:51.992
No need to engineer the perfect prompt.

2143
01:29:52.025 --> 01:29:54.862
In a few seconds, you'll see Apple Intelligence

2144
01:29:52.025 --> 01:29:54.862
In a few seconds, you'll see Apple Intelligence

2145
01:29:54.895 --> 01:29:58.665
creates a preview of what your image could look like.

2146
01:29:58.699 --> 01:30:02.169
A moment later, you'll see more previews you can swipe through.

2147
01:29:58.699 --> 01:30:02.169
A moment later, you'll see more previews you can swipe through.

2148
01:30:02.202 --> 01:30:04.538
This all happens on-device!

2149
01:30:04.571 --> 01:30:09.109
So you have the freedom to experiment and create as many images as you want.

2150
01:30:04.571 --> 01:30:09.109
So you have the freedom to experiment and create as many images as you want.

2151
01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:13.714
This is great for quickly responding to your friends with just the right image.

2152
01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:13.714
This is great for quickly responding to your friends with just the right image.

2153
01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:16.450
When you have a really specific idea in mind,

2154
01:30:16.483 --> 01:30:19.486
you can just type a description to add it to your playground.

2155
01:30:16.483 --> 01:30:19.486
you can just type a description to add it to your playground.

2156
01:30:21.021 --> 01:30:26.660
And you can easily adjust which style you want to use

2157
01:30:21.021 --> 01:30:26.660
And you can easily adjust which style you want to use

2158
01:30:26.693 --> 01:30:31.398
and choose from Animation, Sketch, or Illustration.

2159
01:30:26.693 --> 01:30:31.398
and choose from Animation, Sketch, or Illustration.

2160
01:30:33.066 --> 01:30:36.336
Whichever suits the vibe of your conversation.

2161
01:30:33.066 --> 01:30:36.336
Whichever suits the vibe of your conversation.

2162
01:30:36.370 --> 01:30:38.605
If you change your mind along the way, no problem!

2163
01:30:38.639 --> 01:30:41.408

We've all had that time when we thought we got the perfect shot,

2228
01:33:14.061 --> 01:33:16.930
then realized later it wasn't quite perfect.

2229
01:33:16.964 --> 01:33:21.468
Now, the new Clean Up tool will identify distracting objects in the background,

because you can now use natural language phrases.

2237
01:33:34.515 --> 01:33:36.750
So you can search for really specific things,

2238
01:33:34.515 --> 01:33:36.750
So you can search for really specific things,

2239
01:33:36.783 --> 01:33:39.920
like "Maya skateboarding in a tie-dye shirt,"

2240
01:33:39.953 --> 01:33:42.523
or "Katie with stickers on her face."

2241
01:33:42.556 --> 01:33:46.326
Search in videos is also more powerful, with the ability to find

2242
01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:49.196
a particular moment in the middle of a video clip.

a particular moment in the middle of a video clip.

2244
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:51.498
So you can go right to the relevant segment

2245
01:33:51.532 --> 01:33:55.302
when you search for that video of Maria cartwheeling on the grass.

2263

involves things like water, docks, fishing rods, and boats.

2264

And then it crafts a storyline with unique chapters

2269
01:34:44.017 --> 01:34:46.854
that are based on themes identified from your photos,

2270
01:34:46.887 --> 01:34:50.324
and arranges them into a movie with its own narrative arc.

2275
01:34:59.199 --> 01:35:03.136
and finishes with us holding the prize catch.

asks your permission to share your question,

2330
01:37:11.832 --> 01:37:14.902
and presents the answer directly.

2331
01:37:14.935 --> 01:37:17.871
You can also include photos with your questions.

2332
01:37:17.905 --> 01:37:21.408
If you want some advice on decorating, you can take a picture and ask,

2333
01:37:17.905 --> 01:37:21.408
If you want some advice on decorating, you can take a picture and ask,

2334
01:37:21.441 --> 01:37:23.944
"What kind of plants would go well on this deck?"

2335
01:37:23.977 --> 01:37:27.247
Siri confirms if it's okay to share your photo with ChatGPT

2336
01:37:23.977 --> 01:37:27.247
Siri confirms if it's okay to share your photo with ChatGPT

2337
01:37:27.281 --> 01:37:29.550
and brings back relevant suggestions.

2338
01:37:29.583 --> 01:37:31.485
It's a seamless integration.

2339
01:37:31.518 --> 01:37:34.121
In addition to photos, you can also ask questions

2340
01:37:34.154 --> 01:37:37.724
related to your documents, presentations, or PDFs.

2341
01:37:34.154 --> 01:37:37.724
related to your documents, presentations, or PDFs.

2342
01:37:37.758 --> 01:37:39.393
We've also integrated ChatGPT

2343
01:37:39.426 --> 01:37:43.130
into the systemwide Writing Tools with Compose.

2344
01:37:39.426 --> 01:37:43.130
into the systemwide Writing Tools with Compose.

2345
01:37:43.163 --> 01:37:47.034
You can create content with ChatGPT for whatever you're writing about.

2346
01:37:47.067 --> 01:37:49.670
Suppose you want to create a custom bedtime story

2347
01:37:47.067 --> 01:37:49.670
Suppose you want to create a custom bedtime story

2348
01:37:49.703 --> 01:37:53.340
for your six-year-old who loves butterflies and solving riddles.

2349
01:37:53.373 --> 01:37:56.310
Put in your initial idea and send it to ChatGPT

2350
01:37:53.373 --> 01:37:56.310
Put in your initial idea and send it to ChatGPT

2351
01:37:56.343 --> 01:37:58.645
to get something back she'll love.

2352
01:37:58.679 --> 01:38:03.183
Compose can also help you tap into ChatGPT's image capabilities

2353
01:37:58.679 --> 01:38:03.183
Compose can also help you tap into ChatGPT's image capabilities

2354
01:38:03.217 --> 01:38:05.719
to generate images in a wide variety of styles

2355
01:38:05.752 --> 01:38:08.088
to illustrate your bedtime story.

2356
01:38:08.121 --> 01:38:13.360
You'll be able to access ChatGPT for free and without creating an account.

2357
01:38:08.121 --> 01:38:13.360
You'll be able to access ChatGPT for free and without creating an account.

2358
01:38:13.393 --> 01:38:16.763

and access paid features right within our experiences.

2362
01:38:20.968 --> 01:38:24.605
and access paid features right within our experiences.

2363
01:38:24.638 --> 01:38:28.075
Of course, you're in control over when ChatGPT is used

2364
01:38:28.108 --> 01:38:31.512
and will be asked before any of your information is shared.

2365
01:38:28.108 --> 01:38:31.512
and will be asked before any of your information is shared.

2366
01:38:31.545 --> 01:38:37.017

2367
01:38:31.545 --> 01:38:37.017
ChatGPT integration will be coming to iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia

2368
01:38:37.050 --> 01:38:38.185
later this year.

2369
01:38:38.218 --> 01:38:42.022
We also intend to add support for other AI models in the future.

2370
01:38:38.218 --> 01:38:42.022
We also intend to add support for other AI models in the future.

2371
01:38:42.055 --> 01:38:46.827
Now, let's talk about developers, and how they can integrate

2372
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.964
the experiences powered by Apple Intelligence into their apps.

2373
01:38:46.860 --> 01:38:50.964
the experiences powered by Apple Intelligence into their apps.

2374
01:38:50.998 --> 01:38:54.535
We have updated our SDKs with new APIs and frameworks.

2375
01:38:50.998 --> 01:38:54.535
We have updated our SDKs with new APIs and frameworks.

2376
01:38:54.568 --> 01:38:58.272
For example, developers can add the Image Playground experience

2377
01:38:58.305 --> 01:39:01.208
to their app with just a few lines of code.

2378
01:38:58.305 --> 01:39:01.208
to their app with just a few lines of code.

2379
01:39:01.241 --> 01:39:04.745
This means that an app like Craft can help users create images

2380
01:39:04.778 --> 01:39:07.214
to make their documents much more visual.

2381
01:39:07.247 --> 01:39:09.683
And Writing Tools are automatically available

2382
01:39:09.716 --> 01:39:12.819
within apps that use the standard editable text view.

2383
01:39:09.716 --> 01:39:12.819
within apps that use the standard editable text view.

2384
01:39:12.853 --> 01:39:16.089
So without any development effort, an app like Bear Notes can

2385
01:39:16.123 --> 01:39:21.195
automatically allow users to rewrite, proofread, and summarize notes.

2386
01:39:16.123 --> 01:39:21.195
automatically allow users to rewrite, proofread, and summarize notes.

2387
01:39:21.228 --> 01:39:23.931
Plus, we are building many more ways

2388
01:39:23.964 --> 01:39:27.801
for users to take action in apps with Siri.

2389
01:39:23.964 --> 01:39:27.801
for users to take action in apps with Siri.

2390
01:39:27.835 --> 01:39:30.003
If a developer has already adopted SiriKit,

2391
01:39:27.835 --> 01:39:30.003
If a developer has already adopted SiriKit,

2392
01:39:30.037 --> 01:39:32.339
they'll see immediate enhancements

2393
01:39:32.372 --> 01:39:35.709
from many of Siri's new capabilities without additional work.

2394
01:39:35.742 --> 01:39:39.112
We're also investing deeply in the App Intents framework

2395
01:39:35.742 --> 01:39:39.112
We're also investing deeply in the App Intents framework

2396
01:39:39.146 --> 01:39:42.583
to connect the vast world of apps with Apple Intelligence.

2397
01:39:39.146 --> 01:39:42.583
to connect the vast world of apps with Apple Intelligence.

2398
01:39:42.616 --> 01:39:45.719
We're defining new intents across our operating systems

2399
01:39:45.752 --> 01:39:49.923
and making them available to developers starting with these categories.

2400
01:39:45.752 --> 01:39:49.923
and making them available to developers starting with these categories.

2401
01:39:49.957 --> 01:39:53.861
These intents are pre-defined, trained, and tested,

2402
01:39:53.894 --> 01:39:56.430
so they're easy for developers to adopt.

2403
01:39:56.463 --> 01:39:59.800
Using new App Intents, an app like Darkroom will be able

2404
01:39:59.833 --> 01:40:03.103
to use the Apply Filter intent to give users the ability to say,

2405
01:39:59.833 --> 01:40:03.103
to use the Apply Filter intent to give users the ability to say,

2406
01:40:03.136 --> 01:40:06.807
"Apply a cinematic preset to the photo I took of Ian yesterday."

2407
01:40:03.136 --> 01:40:06.807
"Apply a cinematic preset to the photo I took of Ian yesterday."

2408
01:40:06.840 --> 01:40:10.777
These are just a handful of the updates coming to our platform SDKs

2409
01:40:10.811 --> 01:40:15.048
so developers can add intelligent and useful features to their apps.

2410
01:40:10.811 --> 01:40:15.048
so developers can add intelligent and useful features to their apps.

2411
01:40:15.082 --> 01:40:18.018
We will share more details in the Platforms State of the Union

2412
01:40:15.082 --> 01:40:18.018
We will share more details in the Platforms State of the Union

2413
01:40:18.051 --> 01:40:22.256
later today, like how we are bringing generative intelligence to Xcode

2414
01:40:22.289 --> 01:40:24.992
for developing apps using Swift and SwiftUI,

2415
01:40:22.289 --> 01:40:24.992
for developing apps using Swift and SwiftUI,

2416
01:40:25.025 --> 01:40:27.828
with features like on-device code completion,

2417
01:40:27.861 --> 01:40:31.231
and smart assistance for Swift coding questions.

2418
01:40:27.861 --> 01:40:31.231
and smart assistance for Swift coding questions.

2419
01:40:31.265 --> 01:40:33.901
So that's Apple Intelligence,

2420
01:40:33.934 --> 01:40:38.038
with tremendous benefits for developers and users.

2421
01:40:33.934 --> 01:40:38.038
with tremendous benefits for developers and users.

2422
01:40:38.071 --> 01:40:42.543
This is AI for the rest of us, personal intelligence

2423
01:40:38.071 --> 01:40:42.543
This is AI for the rest of us, personal intelligence

2424
01:40:42.576 --> 01:40:46.780
you can rely on at work, home, and everywhere in between.

2425
01:40:46.813 --> 01:40:50.150
