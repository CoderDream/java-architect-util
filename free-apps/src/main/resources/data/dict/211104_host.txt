Hello. This is 6 Minute English from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

Sam
And I’m Sam.

Neil
The Olympic Games happen every four years and the most recent games were held in Tokyo this summer. Did you watch them, Sam?

Sam
Yes, I saw British swimmer, Adam Peaty, win a gold medal and - my personal favourite - 13-year-old, Sky Brown, competing in an exciting sport which was added to the Olympics this year: skateboarding.

Neil
Olympic athletes inspire people around the world to take on new challenges, eat healthily and get fit. So it seems strange that some of the companies that sponsor – or pay for, the Olympic Games also sell food and drink which is linked to obesity, heart disease and diabetes.

Sam
Tobacco advertising was banned from international sport in 2005 because of the harmful effects of smoking. But other companies selling less-than-healthy products still sponsor big sporting events.

Neil
These could be sugary drink companies, or others who sell fast food – hot food, like hamburgers, that is quick to cook and serve but which is often unhealthy.

Sam
In this programme we’ll be asking whether it’s right for companies selling unhealthy products to sponsor sporting events.

Neil
But first it’s time for my quiz question, Sam. McDonalds had a long history with the Olympic Games until the company ended the partnership ahead of the 2024 games in Paris. But why did McDonalds choose to quit? Was it because: a) they wanted to change the name of French fries to McFries? b) they didn’t want to call their hamburger, ‘Le Big Mac’? or, c) they wanted to be the only company selling cheese for cheeseburgers?

Sam
Hmm, I think maybe it’s a) because they wanted to call French fries, McFries.

Neil
OK, Sam, we’ll find out the answer later in the programme.

Sam
Someone who is worried about the relationship between fast food and sport is Dr Sandro Demaio. He worked for the World Health Organisation specialising in obesity before starting his own public health agency in Australia.

Neil
Here is Dr Demaio speaking with BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain, about the problem with unhealthy brands and food products:

Dr Sandro Demaio
By having their brand alongside a young person’s favourite sporting hero, on the chest of their national team, it does two things. First of all, it creates brand attachment, so if you’re a young child you built the connection in your mind that basically fast food equals success. At the same time it also gives a health halo to that brand. Then you start to think in your mind, even subconsciously, that it can’t be that bad…

Sam
You’ve probably heard of ‘brand loyalty’, where people have a favourite brand they always buy, but Dr Demaio is concerned about brand attachment.

Neil
Brand attachment is the emotional connection between humans and brands. It goes deeper than loyalty so that people mentally connect a particular company with feelings of winning, being healthy and success.

Sam
The problem comes when these feelings attach to companies that aren’t healthy at all. Dr Demaio says this creates a health halo – the belief that something is good, like an angel’s halo, even though there is little evidence to support this.

Neil
On the other hand, fast food and fizzy drink companies invest large amounts of money in sport, over 4.5 billion dollars since the 2016 Rio Olympics, much of it supporting athletes around the world.

Sam
Yes, with travel, training and equipment the cost of being an Olympic athlete can be huge. And depending on your country and your sport, there may be little financial help.

Neil
Many athletes are desperate for any sponsorship they can get - but does that make it right to promote unhealthy eating in return?

Sam
Not according to Dr Demaio, who thinks people should worry about the nutritional value of fast food, as he explained to BBC World Service’s, The Food Chain:

Dr Sandro Demaio
When we think about foods and beverages of public health concern, we tend to start by talking about highly-processed foods, particularly ultra- processed foods. These are foods that have been really broken down to their basic elements and then built up – they’re more products really than foods – they’re made in a laboratory not a kitchen.

Neil
Dr Demaio mentions unhealthy foods and beverages – another word for drinks.

Sam
He’s concerned about the public health risk of ultra-processed food – foods containing extra ingredients like chemicals, colourings and sweeteners that you wouldn’t add when cooking homemade food.

Neil
A potato, for example, is natural - minimally processed. Bake a potato and it becomes ‘processed’. Make French fries and it’s ‘ultra-processed’.

Sam
And speaking of French fries, Neil, what was the answer to your quiz question?

Neil
Yes, I asked Sam the reason behind the decision McDonald’s made not to sponsor the 2024 Paris Olympics.

Sam
I said it was, a) because they wanted to call French fries, McFries.

Neil
Which was… the wrong answer! In fact, McDonald’s wanted to be only company allowed to advertise cheese so it could boost cheeseburger sales.

Sam
This didn’t go down well with officials in France, a country with over a thousand different types of cheese! OK, let’s recap the vocabulary from this programme starting with fast food – hot food that is quick to cook but may be unhealthy.

Neil
Companies that sponsor sports events, pay for them to happen.

Sam
Brand attachment is a psychological connection between someone and a brand.

Neil
A health halo is the perception that something is healthy for you, even if it’s not.

Sam
Ultra-processed foods are foods containing added artificial ingredients like colourings and preservatives.

Neil
And a beverage is another word for a drink.

Sam
